To decompose the task of classifying the given example as one of the defective argument types (which is the application of \( IDAA \)), we will take it step by step.

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition \(<P>\)
The proposition \(<P>\) in the given statement is: "My new sport psychology intervention works!"

### Step 2: Identify the Reason \(<R>\)
The reason \(<R>\) presented for the proposition is: "I chose the player with the lowest batting average based on the last game from each of the teams in our amateur baseball league. Then I gave each of them my 5-minute intervention."

### Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason \(<PR>\)
The proof of reason \(<PR>\) given is: "Almost all of them improved their batting average in the next game!"

### Step 4: Examine Possible Types of Defective Arguments
Next, we will consider each type of defective argument and see if the statement fits any of them.

### Examining for \(<G>\) - Generalization
- **Generalization** involves asserting something is true for all based on a limited sample. 
    - Decision: The argument makes an assumption about the efficacy of the intervention based on a specific subset of players (those with the lowest batting average). This alone doesn’t seem to fit \(<G>\), because the assertion is about the intervention's success, not about broader generalization beyond the observed group.

### Examining for \(<FE>\) - Incomplete Enumeration
- **Incomplete Enumeration** involves claims of covering all possibilities while missing some.
    - Decision: The argument does not claim to have enumerated all possible interventions but focuses on one specific intervention and its immediate effects. Thus, \(<FE>\) does not apply.

### Examining for \(<IR>\) - Inconclusive Reason
- **Inconclusive Reason** involves reasons that don’t conclusively support the proposition.
    - Decision: The reason (\(R\)) does not conclusively prove the efficacy of the intervention because there are other potential explanations (e.g., regression to the mean). Hence, \(<IR>\) does apply here.

### Examining for \(<WCB>\) - Insufficient Causal Basis
- **Insufficient Causal Basis** occurs when the reason provided is not compelling.
    - Decision: The causal link provided (that a 5-minute intervention directly caused the improvement) does not consider other factors, thus the argument could also be \(<WCB>\).

### Examining for \(<RR>\) - Faulty Repetition of Proposition
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition** is when the reason repeats the proposition.
    - Decision: The statement does not simply repeat the proposition in its reason, so \(<RR>\) does not apply.

### Examining for \(<FU>\) - Presumptuous Consensus
- **Presumptuous Consensus** involves assuming something is true because it’s universally agreed upon.
    - Decision: The argument does not cite universal agreement to support its proof, so \(<FU>\) does not apply.

### Examining for \(<DEP>\) - Ambiguous Language Use
- **Ambiguous Language Use** occurs when the proof can be interpreted in more than one way.
    - Decision: While "improved batting average" could be somewhat vague, it’s still reasonably specific in context. So \(<DEP>\) does not strongly apply.

### Step 5: Conclusion
Based on the analysis, the defective argument types that most appropriately describe the given statement are:
1. **\(<IR>\) - Inconclusive Reason** because the reason provided does not conclusively support the proposition.
2. **\(<WCB>\) - Insufficient Causal Basis** because the causal link between the intervention and the improvement in batting averages is weak and not compelling.

Therefore, the given example is classified into types \(\langle IR \rangle\) and \(\langle WCB \rangle\).
