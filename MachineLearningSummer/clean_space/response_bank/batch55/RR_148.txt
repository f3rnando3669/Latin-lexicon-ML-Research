For 
To apply <IDAA> (the decomposition method) to the task of classifying the given argument string as one of the defective argument types, we'll first break down the process into specific steps and then proceed with each step methodically.

**Step 1: Understand and Analyze the Proposition <P>**
- **Proposition**: Set forth summarily what is intended to be proved.  
  "Ralph Nader and Pat Buchanan are banging at the doors, and the political establishment, consisting of both politicians and the media, seems determined not to let them in on the grounds that they have no public support."
  
  **Proposed Proposition (P)**: 
  The political establishment is determined not to let Ralph Nader and Pat Buchanan in because they claim these candidates have no public support.

**Step 2: Identify the Reason <R> Provided**
- **Reason**: Sets forth the causal basis for the proposition, establishing its truth.
  The reason presented is the claim that Ralph Nader and Pat Buchanan "have no public support."

**Step 3: Determine if There Is Proof of Reason (PR)**
- **Proof of Reason**: Corroborates the reason via additional arguments or evidence.
  In this statement, no additional arguments or evidence is provided to substantiate the reason that Nader and Buchanan have "no public support."

**Step 4: Evaluate for Defective Argument Types**
The goal is to classify the argument string into one of the defective argument types: <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <WCB>, <RR>, <FU>, or <DEP>.

**Step 5: Match Argument Components to Defective Types**
- **Generalization (<G>)**: 
  No assertion is based on part or majority to apply to all.

- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**:
  No enumeration of possibilities is presented, so this is not applicable.

- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: 
  This Reason fails to conclusively prove the Proposition, as no substantial evidence or strong causal basis has been provided. It merely claims "no public support" without proof.

- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**:
  While <R> is weak due to the absence of compelling evidence, this defect isn’t strictly about causal strength in relation to "no public support."

- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**:
  The Reason doesn’t repeat the Proposition verbatim or in essence.

- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**:
  Asserts a general consensus without proof but isn't necessarily applicable here.

- **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**:
  The language used isn't inherently ambiguous in multiple interpretations.

**Step 6: Final Classification**
After reviewing each potential defective type, the argument string aligns most closely with <IR> (Inconclusive Reason):
- The Reason "they have no public support" is not sufficiently backed up or demonstrated to validate the Proposition.

**Conclusion**
The defect in the given argument string: "Ralph Nader and Pat Buchanan are banging at the doors, and the political establishment, consisting of both politicians and the media, seems determined not to let them in on the grounds that they have no public support," is best classified as **<IR>** - Inconclusive Reason.
