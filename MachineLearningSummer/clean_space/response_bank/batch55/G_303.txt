For 
To apply <IDAA> to the task of classifying the string "IBM is a reputable organization, so all of its employees must be reputable" as one of the defective argument types, we need to break down the task of classification into specific steps (decomposition). Here is the detailed decomposition and application:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition of IDAA
1. **Identify and Understand the Proposition <P>:**
   - **Step 1:** Identify the proposition <P> in the argument.
   - **Step 2:** Clarify what is being asserted or intended to be proven by <P>.

2. **Identify and Understand the Reason <R>:**
   - **Step 3:** Identify the Reason <R> that has been provided to support <P>.
   - **Step 4:** Clarify how <R> is supposed to provide a basis for <P>.

3. **Analyze the Proposition and Reason for Defects:**
   - **Step 5:** Evaluate if <P> fits any of the defective argument criteria.
   - **Step 6:** Evaluate if <R> fits any of the defective argument criteria.

4. **Classify the Argument:**
   - **Step 7:** Determine which specific defect category (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>) the argument best fits into.
   - **Step 8:** Justify the classification with evidence from the argument.

### Application to the Given String
#### Step 1: Identify the Proposition <P>
- **Proposition (P):** "All of its employees must be reputable."

#### Step 2: Clarify <P>
- The assertion is that every single employee of IBM is reputable. This is a sweeping statement regarding the characteristics of all employees based on the company's reputation.

#### Step 3: Identify the Reason <R>
- **Reason (R):** "IBM is a reputable organization."

#### Step 4: Clarify <R>
- The reason provided is that since IBM is a reputable organization, it is implied that this reputation extends to all individuals employed by it.

#### Step 5 & 6: Analyze for Defects
- **Evaluate <P>:** 
  - The proposition is making a general statement about "all employees" based on the reputation of the organization.
- **Evaluate <R>:**
  - The reason is that IBM, as a whole, has a good reputation, but this doesn't necessarily mean that every individual employee shares this characteristic.

#### Step 7: Determine Defective Argument Type
- The argument commits the fallacy of **Generalization (<G>)**. It takes the reputation of the organization and overextends it to include every single employee without considering individual variations.

#### Step 8: Justify the Classification
- **Justification:**
  - This argument assumes that because IBM has a good reputation, every single employee of IBM also has a good reputation. This is a classic example of a generalization, where a quality of a group (in this case, the company) is assumed to apply to all members of that group (the employees) without adequate evidence to support the assertion for each individual.

### Conclusion
The argument, "IBM is a reputable organization, so all of its employees must be reputable," is an example of **Generalization (<G>)**. This defective argument type occurs when an assertion based on the characteristics of a group is applied to all its members without sufficient evidence.
