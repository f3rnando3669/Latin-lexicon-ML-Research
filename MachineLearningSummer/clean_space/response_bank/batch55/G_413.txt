For 
To apply <IDAA> (the decomposition of a classification task into specific steps) to the given string, we need to break down the task of classifying the defective argument into specific steps and then apply these steps to the provided string.

The given string is: "I don't know how to complete my geometry homework tonight; I probably can't pass the course since I can't do this one assignment."

Here are the specific steps to decompose and classify the argument:

**Step 1: Understand the Proposition (P) and Reason (R)**
- **P**: Identify what the speaker is intending to prove.
  - Here, the speaker's proposition (P) seems to be: "I probably can't pass the course."

- **R**: Identify the reason the speaker provides to support the proposition.
  - Here, the reason (R) given by the speaker is: "I don't know how to complete my geometry homework tonight."

**Step 2: Identify additional information (PR)**
- **PR**: Identify any proof or evidence supporting the reason.
  - In this case, there doesn't appear to be an additional argument or proof (PR) provided beyond the speaker's statement.

**Step 3: Evaluate the argument for defects (types G, FE, IR, RR, WCB, FU, DEP)**
- **G (Generalization)**: Is the proposition based on insufficiently broad evidence?
  - Yes, the proposition appears to generalize an inability to complete one assignment to failing the entire course.

- **FE (Incomplete Enumeration)**: Does the argument claim to enumerate all possibilities but miss some?
  - Not applicable here; the argument isn't listing possibilities.

- **IR (Inconclusive Reason)**: Does the reason provided fail to conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition?
  - Yes, the reason that the speaker can't complete one assignment tonight doesn't conclusively prove they will fail the entire course.

- **RR (Faulty Repetition of Proposition)**: Does the reason merely restate the proposition?
  - No, the reason isn't a repetition of the proposition.

- **WCB (Insufficient Causal Basis)**: Is the causal basis for the reason weak?
  - Yes, the causal link between not being able to finish one homework and failing the course is weak.

- **FU (Presumptuous Consensus)**: Does the argument assume a consensus without proving it?
  - Not applicable; the argument doesn't assume a consensus.

- **DEP (Ambiguous Language Use)**: Can the term in the argument be taken differently than intended?
  - Not applicable; the language in the argument is straightforward.

**Step 4: Classify the Argument**
- Based on the evaluation,
  - The argument fits **G (Generalization)** because it is based on insufficiently broad evidence, generalizing the failure of one assignment to the entire course.
  - The argument also fits **IR (Inconclusive Reason)** because the reason provided does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition.
  - Additionally, it fits **WCB (Insufficient Causal Basis)** because the causal basis is not compelling.

Therefore, the string "I don't know how to complete my geometry homework tonight; I probably can't pass the course since I can't do this one assignment." can be classified as containing defects of type <G>, <IR>, and <WCB>.
