For 
To apply IDAA (the process of decomposing and executing IDA) to the statement "Pamela never lies. She told me herself, so it must be true," we will follow these steps:

### Step 1: Decomposition of the Task (D)
Decompose the task of identifying defective arguments (IDA) into specific steps:
1. Identify the proposition (P) in the statement.
2. Identify the reason (R) given for the proposition.
3. Identify the proof of reason (PR) if present.
4. Match the identified components (P, R, PR) with the definitions of defective arguments (G, FE, IR, WCB, RR, FU, DEP).
5. Classify the statement based on the identified matches.

### Step 2: Identification of Proposition (P)
Identify the proposition (P) in the given statement.
- **Statement:** "Pamela never lies. She told me herself, so it must be true."
- **Proposition (P):** "Pamela never lies."

### Step 3: Identification of Reason (R)
Identify the reason (R) provided for the proposition.
- **Reason (R):** "She told me herself."

### Step 4: Identification of Proof of Reason (PR)
Identify if there is any proof of reason (PR) present.
- In this case, there is no additional proof provided beyond the reason given, so there is no proof of reason (PR).

### Step 5: Match with Defective Argument Types
Now match the identified components (P, R) with the definitions of defective arguments:
- **Proposition (P):** "Pamela never lies."
- **Reason (R):** "She told me herself."

#### Check against Defective Argument Types:
1. **Generalization (G):** No generalization is made in this argument.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** The argument does not attempt to enumerate possibilities.
3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** The reason given does not conclusively support the proposition. Just because Pamela claims she never lies does not prove she is truthful.
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** The causal basis for the proposition is weak since it relies solely on Pamela's own assertion.
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** The reason essentially repeats the proposition without providing new information.
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** There is no appeal to universal agreement.
7. **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** The language is not ambiguous.

### Step 6: Classification
Based on the above analysis, the defective argument types that most closely match the given statement are:
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**

### Conclusion:
The given argument "Pamela never lies. She told me herself, so it must be true." primarily exhibits characteristics of **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**, as well as aspects of **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** and **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**.
