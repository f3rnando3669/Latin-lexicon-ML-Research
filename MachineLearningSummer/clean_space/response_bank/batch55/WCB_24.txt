For 
To apply the process of identifying defective arguments (IDA) in the given string "Water fluoridation affects the brain. Citywide, student’s test scores began to drop five months after fluoridation began. The water fluoridation must have caused the student's test scores to drop." using IDAA, we will:

1. **Decompose the task (D) into specific steps:** 
   - Identify the Proposition (P).
   - Identify the Reason (R).
   - Identify the Proof of Reason (PR).
   - Analyze if there are any defective argument types (G, FE, IR, WCB, RR, FU, DEP).

2. **Apply each specific step to the given string (IDA):**
   
### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (P)
The proposition is the statement which sets forth what is intended to be proved.
- **P:** "The water fluoridation must have caused the student's test scores to drop."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (R)
The reason sets forth the causal basis for the proposition.
- **R:** "Citywide, student’s test scores began to drop five months after fluoridation began."

### Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason (PR)
The proof of reason corroborates the reason by means of additional arguments.
- **PR:** "Water fluoridation affects the brain."

### Step 4: Identify Defective Argument Types - Generalization (G)
- Does the proposition apply a general conclusion based on a specific case?
- There is no overgeneralization based on a subset here; the argument remains focused on the specific case in the city.

### Step 5: Identify Defective Argument Types - Incomplete Enumeration (FE)
- Is the argument missing important possibilities or factors?
- Yes, the argument does not consider other possible explanations for the drop in test scores.

### Step 6: Identify Defective Argument Types - Inconclusive Reason (IR)
- Does the Reason conclusively demonstrate the Proposition?
- No, the Reason only establishes a temporal relationship, not a causal one.

### Step 7: Identify Defective Argument Types - Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)
- Is the causal basis for the Proposition compelling?
- No, the causal link between fluoridation and test scores is weak and speculative without more evidence.

### Step 8: Identify Defective Argument Types - Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)
- Is the Reason merely a repetition of the Proposition?
- No, the Reason is not a restatement of the Proposition.

### Step 9: Identify Defective Argument Types - Presumptuous Consensus (FU)
- Is the proof of reason assumed as certain by stating a universal belief?
- No, the Proof of Reason doesn't reference universal agreement but rather a specific claim.

### Step 10: Identify Defective Argument Types - Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)
- Can the proof of reason be taken in another sense than intended?
- There could be some ambiguity in "affects the brain," but it's more directly relevant to the logic of the argument rather than different interpretations.

### Conclusion:
Based on this analysis, the defective argument types present in the string are:
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** The argument misses out on other potential causes for the drop in student test scores.
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** The reason does not conclusively link the drop in test scores to water fluoridation.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** The causal basis provided is not compelling.

By applying IDAA step-by-step to the given string, we identified multiple defective argument types contributing to its overall weakness.
