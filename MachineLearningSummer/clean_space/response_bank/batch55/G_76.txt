For 
To apply IDAA (the decomposition of IDA into specific steps) to classify the statement "Tyler's friends are all obnoxious, he's a bad kid," we'll break down the process step by step:

### Step 1: Understand the statement
The statement contains an assertion about Tyler being a "bad kid" based on the claim that "Tyler's friends are all obnoxious."

### Step 2: Identify the Proposition (<P>)
Define the main proposition of the statement:
- **Proposition (<P>):** Tyler is a bad kid.

### Step 3: Identify the Reason (<R>)
Identify the causal basis for the proposition:
- **Reason (<R>):** Tyler's friends are all obnoxious.

### Step 4: Correlate the argument structure to known defective argument types
We need to classify why this reason does not adequately establish the truth of the proposition. We'll check each defective argument type to see if it fits:

- **Generalization (<G>):** Does the assertion make a claim about all based on some or a majority? No, this doesn't apply here.
  
- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** Does it miss out on pertinent possibilities? Not applicable here since the issue isn't about enumeration.
  
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** Does the reason fail to conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition? Yes, the obnoxiousness of Tyler's friends does not conclusively demonstrate that Tyler himself is a bad kid.
  
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** Is the causal basis weak? Yes, attributing the qualities of Tyler's friends directly to Tyler without more information provides a weak causal basis.
  
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** Is the reason simply repeating the proposition? No, <R> and <P> are different here.
  
- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** Does it assume consensus? No applicable presumption of consensus here.
  
- **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):** Is the language used to introduce ambiguity? No significant ambiguous language noted here.

### Step 5: Select the most appropriate defective argument type
Given the provided definitions, the primary issue appears to be that the reason (R) does not conclusively establish the proposition (P). Thus, this seems to fall under:

- **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** The reason does not conclusively demonstrate Tyler's "badness" based solely on the behavior of his friends.

### Conclusion
The statement "Tyler's friends are all obnoxious, he's a bad kid," uses the fallacy of **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**.
