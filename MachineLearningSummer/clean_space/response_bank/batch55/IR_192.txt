For 
To apply IDAA (decomposition of the classification task) to "His opinions about sports mean nothing - he can barely tie his own shoes!", we need to break down the task of classifying the argument into specific steps. Here's the step-by-step decomposition and analysis:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition <P>
- **Proposition (P)**: "His opinions about sports mean nothing."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason <R>
- **Reason (R)**: "He can barely tie his own shoes."

### Step 3: Determine if the Reason is Relevant to the Proposition
- Is the reason that "he can barely tie his own shoes" relevant to the validity of his opinions about sports? 
- **Analysis**: There is no direct causal link between someone's ability to tie their shoes and the validity of their opinions about a separate subject like sports.

### Step 4: Identify the Type of Defective Argument
Given that the reason provided does not conclusive establish or even relate logically to the proposition, the argument is demonstrating at least one kind of defect. Let's classify which type:

#### Evaluate Possible Defects:
1. **Generalization (G)**: The argument is not generalizing from a part to a whole.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: There is no enumeration of possibilities, so this doesn't apply.
3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The reason does not demonstrate the correctness of the proposition because the ability to tie one's shoes is not related to opinions on sports.
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: The causal basis provided (ability to tie shoes) is not a compelling link to the proposition about the validity of sports opinions.
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: The reason is not a repetition of the proposition.
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: There is no mention of a universal agreement that sports opinions depend on shoe-tying ability.
7. **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: The terms are clear and unambiguous in this context.

### Step 5: Make the Final Classification
Based on the evaluation, the most fitting classifications for this defective argument are:

- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The reason provided does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: The reason is not a compelling or relevant causal basis for the proposition.

### Conclusion
The argument "His opinions about sports mean nothing - he can barely tie his own shoes!" should be classified as both **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** and **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**.

This classification follows from the analysis that the reason given does not logically support or relate to the conclusion drawn in the proposition.
