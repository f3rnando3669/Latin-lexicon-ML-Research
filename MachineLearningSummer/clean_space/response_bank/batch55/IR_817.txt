Sure, let's break down the process of applying \(<IDAA>\) to the string "I did not complete my homework last night? Well, you did not do yours last week either." in a step-by-step manner. \(<IDAA>\) is defined as the application of decomposing the task of classifying \(<s>\) into specific steps.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition for \(<IDA>\):

1. **Identify the Proposition \(<P>\) and Reason \(<R>\)**:
   - Look for a statement that serves as the main assertion or claim \(<P>\).
   - Identify any supporting statements that serve as the reason \(<R>\).

2. **Analyze the Structure of the Argument**:
   - Determine if there is a \(<PR>\) (Proof of Reason).
   - See if the argument fits the form of a complete argument with \(<P>\), \(<R>\), and \(<PR>\).

3. **Identify Defective Argument Types**:
   - Check if the argument matches any of the defective argument patterns (\<G\>, \<FE\>, \<IR\>, \<RR\>, \<WCB\>, \<FU\>, or \<DEP\>).

### Detailed Step-by-Step Analysis:

#### Step 1: Identify the Proposition \(<P>\) and Reason \(<R>\)

- **String**: "I did not complete my homework last night? Well, you did not do yours last week either."
  - Proposition \(<P>\): "I did not complete my homework last night"
  - Reason \(<R>\): "Well, you did not do yours last week either."

#### Step 2: Analyze the Structure of the Argument

- Check if there is a coherent \(<PR>\) (Proof of Reason). In this case, there doesn't seem to be an additional argument to prove the reason \(<R>\); the structure relies on a direct comparison.

#### Step 3: Identify Defective Argument Types

- **Generalization \(<G>\)**: This does not appear to involve a generalization of a specific case to a broader context.
- **Incomplete Enumeration \(<FE>\)**: This does not involve listing possibilities and missing out on some.
- **Inconclusive Reason \(<IR>\)**: The reason given ("you did not do yours last week either") does not conclusively establish the correctness of the proposition about not doing homework the previous night.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis \(<WCB>\)**: The causal basis is weak as it does not logically support why the proposition is true.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition \(<RR>\)**: The reason provided is not a repetition of the proposition.
- **Presumptuous Consensus \(<FU>\)**: This does not assume a consensus to be the proof.
- **Ambiguous Language Use \(<DEP>\)**: The language is not ambiguous; itâ€™s a clear comparison or accusation.

#### Classification:

- Based on the provided steps and the analysis, the primary defective argument type here seems to be **Inconclusive Reason \(<IR>\)** and potentially **Insufficient Causal Basis \(<WCB>\)**. The reason ("you did not do yours last week either") fails to conclusively demonstrate the correctness or relevance of the proposition ("I did not complete my homework last night").

### Conclusion

The string "I did not complete my homework last night? Well, you did not do yours last week either." is classified as having the defective argument types:

- **Inconclusive Reason \(<IR>\)**
- **Insufficient Causal Basis \(<WCB>\)**

Both indicate that the given reason does not properly support the proposition.
