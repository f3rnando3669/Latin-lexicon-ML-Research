For 
To apply the IDAA (application of <D> to <IDA>) process to the given string in order to classify it as one of the defective argument types, we will decompose the task into specific steps. Here is a step-by-step approach:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):** Determine the main claim or assertion in the argument.
2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):** Find the causal basis or reasoning presented for the proposition.
3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>):** Look for any additional arguments or evidence provided to support the reason.

4. **Classify the Defective Argument:**
    - Determine if the argument fits any of the defective argument types:
      - **<G> (Generalization)**
      - **<FE> (Incomplete Enumeration)**
      - **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason)**
      - **<WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis)**
      - **<RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition)**
      - **<FU> (Presumptuous Consensus)**
      - **<DEP> (Ambiguous Language Use)**

Now, let’s apply these steps to the given argument:

---

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

#### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)
The main claim or assertion in the argument is:
- "SuperCyberDate.con determined that Sally and Billy are a great match."

#### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)
The causal basis or reasoning presented for the proposition is:
- "because they both like pizza, movies, junk food, Janet Jackson, and vote republican."

#### Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>)
The additional arguments or evidence provided against the reason is:
- "What SuperCyberDate.con did not take into consideration were the 245 other likes and dislikes that were very different for both Sally and Billy—such as the fact that Billy is gay."

#### Step 4: Classify the Defective Argument
Analyze the evidence and identify the defective argument type:
- The argument points out a major flaw: "245 other likes and dislikes were very different for both Sally and Billy," including a significant one—Billy's sexual orientation. This suggests an incomplete consideration of all relevant factors.
- This indicates that the enumeration of reasons given by SuperCyberDate.con is incomplete because it fails to account for many other pertinent factors.

### Conclusion:
Based on the identified parts and analysis, the defective argument type is:

**<FE> (Incomplete Enumeration):** The proposition is defective because it claims that Sally and Billy are a great match based on a limited set of common likes, while ignoring many other pertinent factors that could affect their compatibility, notably "the 245 other likes and dislikes" and the fact that "Billy is gay."

Thus, the given argument is classified as an **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**.
