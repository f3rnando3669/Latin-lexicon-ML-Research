Applying the advanced task decomposition (IDAA) to the task of classifying the given string (conversation between Mom and Jonny) (IDA), we will break down the process step-by-step:

### Decomposition Steps (D) for IDA Classification:
1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
   - Locate the main assertion or claim being made in the argument.

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   - Identify the causal basis or reasoning supporting the proposition.

3. **Check for Proof of Reason (<PR>):**
   - Determine if there is supporting evidence or additional arguments corroborating the reason.

4. **Examine for Defective Argument Types:**
   - Analyze the identified components to see if they fit any of the defective argument types: <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>.

### Applying the Decomposition Steps (D) to the String:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
   - **Proposition by Mom:** "Watching TV that close will make you go blind, so move back!"
   - **Proposition by Jonny:** "That is B.S., Mom. Sorry, I am not moving."

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   - **Reason implied by Mom:** The causal basis implied here is that the act of watching TV from a close distance is harmful and could lead to blindness.
   - **Reason by Jonny:** Jonny dismisses the proposition as false without providing a specific reason for his disbelief.

3. **Check for Proof of Reason (<PR>):**
   - **Proof of Reason by Mom:** Mom does not provide immediate proof or additional arguments to support her claim.
   - **Proof of Reason by Jonny:** Jonny does not offer any proof or additional arguments, just a dismissal of Mom's proposition.

4. **Examine for Defective Argument Types:**
   - **For Mom's argument**:
     - **Defective Argument Type: <IR>** (Inconclusive Reason)
       - The proposition that "watching TV that close will make you go blind" is not conclusively demonstrated. She states it as fact without providing conclusive evidence.
     - **Possibly <G>** (Generalization)
       - The claim is generalized based on an assumption that might apply to some cases but not necessarily to all.

   - **For Jonny's Counter:**
     - **Defective Argument Type: <RR>** (Faulty Repetition of Proposition)
       - Jonny’s rebuttal ("That is B.S.") does not provide a new reason but merely denies Mom’s original proposition. This replicates the function of the proposition without providing sound reasoning.
     - **Possibly <IR>** (Inconclusive Reason)
       - The refusal to accept the proposition without a supportive argument can be seen as an inconclusive reason.

### Conclusion:
- **Mom's argument is best classified as an <IR> (Inconclusive Reason),** since her reason does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of her proposition.
- **Jonny's counter-argument can be classified as an <RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition)** because he dismisses the proposition without offering new reasoning.

Thus, applying the IDAA approach, the defective argument types identified in the given interaction are <IR> for Mom's argument and <RR> for Jonny's counter.
