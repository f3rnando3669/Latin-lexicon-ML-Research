For 
To apply the process of IDAA (Identification and Decomposition of Argument Analysis) to the statement "There is no concrete proof that Duterte himself is corrupt; therefore, he is an honest politician," we need to break down the task of classifying the defective argument (IDA) into specific steps (D).

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (D)

1. **Identify the Proposition (P):**
   - The proposition (P) in the argument is the conclusion that the speaker is trying to prove.
   - **Proposition (P):** "Duterte is an honest politician."

2. **Identify the Reason (R):**
   - The reason (R) supporting the proposition is the premise or causal basis presented.
   - **Reason (R):** "There is no concrete proof that Duterte himself is corrupt."

3. **Evaluate the Argument for Specific Defects:**
   - We now need to assess if the argument has any of the typical defects.

4. **Classify the Defective Argument (IDA):**
   - Compare the identified proposition and reason against each defect type: <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, and <DEP>.
   
### Application to the Given Statement

1. **Proposition (P):**
   - "Duterte is an honest politician."

2. **Reason (R):**
   - "There is no concrete proof that Duterte himself is corrupt."

3. **Evaluate Defective Argument Types:**

   - **Generalization (G):** This defect involves making an assertion based on a part or majority, projecting it as a whole. The statement does not fit this pattern.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** This involves claiming complete enumeration of possibilities but missing out on pertinent ones. The statement is not about an enumeration of possibilities.
   - **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** This defect is when the reason does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition. The reason here, "no concrete proof of corruption," does not necessarily prove honesty.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** This defect involves the reason being weak or not compelling enough. Arguably, lack of proof of corruption is not a compelling reason to assert positive honesty.
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** This involves the reason repeating the proposition. The reason is different from the proposition.
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** This defect assumes universal agreement on something still in dispute. The argument does not rely on a presumed consensus.
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** This defect arises when the language is ambiguous. The language in the given argument does not suffer from ambiguity.

### Classification of the Defective Argument

After evaluating the argument based on the steps:

- The argument most closely fits the category of **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** because the reason ("no concrete proof of corruption") does not conclusively prove the proposition ("Duterte is an honest politician").

**Thus, the classification (IDA) of the argument "There is no concrete proof that Duterte himself is corrupt; therefore, he is an honest politician" is <IR>.**
