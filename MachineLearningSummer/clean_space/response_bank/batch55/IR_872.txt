For 
To apply the decomposition approach (IDAA) to the task of classifying the string "Says Robot 2, attacking Robot 1 instead of his arguments," we need to break the task into specific steps. Each step will help us analyze the string and identify which type of defective argument it exemplifies. Let's proceed step by step:

1. **Identify the Structure of the Defective Argument:**
   - Recognize the nature of the statement: "Says Robot 2, attacking Robot 1 instead of his arguments."
   - This step involves understanding what part of the defective argument is being exhibited (e.g., the proposition, reason, or proof of reason).

2. **Analyze the Components:**
   - Determine if there is a proposition (P) being made.
   - Determine if there is an associated reason (R) that purports to support the proposition.
   - Determine if there is a proof of reason (PR) to corroborate the reason.

3. **Mapping to the Defective Argument Types:**
   - Compare the structure and content of the string against the known types of defective arguments: <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, and <DEP>.
   - Identify if the statement commits any of the specified logical fallacies or argument defects.

Now, let's apply these steps to the given string.

---

**Step 1: Identify the Structure of the Defective Argument**

The string “Says Robot 2, attacking Robot 1 instead of his arguments” implies some action taken by Robot 2. This action is described as "attacking Robot 1," and not addressing the arguments provided by Robot 1.

**Step 2: Analyze the Components**

- **Proposition (P):** The string doesn’t explicitly state a proposition, but it critiques Robot 2’s approach.
- **Reason (R):** The reason is implicit in attacking Robot 1 rather than countering his arguments.
- **Proof of Reason (PR):** There is no specific corroborating evidence or further argument provided.

Given this, it seems the statement directly critiques an approach taken in an argument rather than constituting an argument itself.

**Step 3: Mapping to the Defective Argument Types**

Compare the string to each defective argument type:

- **<G> Generalization:** Not applicable, as the statement doesn’t generalize.
- **<FE> Incomplete Enumeration:** Not applicable, as there is no enumeration of possibilities.
- **<IR> Inconclusive Reason:** Not applicable, as no conclusive or inconclusive reason is provided for a proposition.
- **<RR> Faulty Repetition of Proposition:** Not applicable, no repetition of the proposition is present.
- **<WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis:** Not applicable, as there is no weak causal basis provided.
- **<FU> Presumptuous Consensus:** Not applicable, as there is no claim of universal agreement.
- **<DEP> Ambiguous Language Use:** Not applicable, as the language appears clear.

The statement best fits the description of a logical fallacy known as an **ad hominem** attack, where an individual attacks the person instead of addressing the arguments presented.

However, based on the definitions provided, none of the defective argument types directly correspond to an ad hominem attack. The string “attacking Robot 1 instead of his arguments” would logically be categorized based on the type of defect it represents.

Given the provided classification types, it may most closely align with <IR> Inconclusive Reason, where attacking the individual (Robot 1) does not address nor conclusively dispute the proposition made by Robot 1.

**Conclusion:** The most appropriate classification within the provided defect types for the string "Says Robot 2, attacking Robot 1 instead of his arguments" might be <IR> Inconclusive Reason, as the attack on Robot 1 does not conclusively address or refute Robot 1's arguments.
