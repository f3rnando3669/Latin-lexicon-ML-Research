To apply IDAA to the argument "Today late for ten minutes, tomorrow late for an hour, and then someday you will simply cease to show up," we need to decompose the task of classifying the argument type (IDA) into specific steps (D). Let's proceed step by step.

### Step 1: Understand the Proposition (<P>) and Reason (<R>)
- **Proposition (<P>)**: What is the claim or assertion that is being made?
  - In this case, the proposition could be stated as: Being late initially for a short period will inevitably lead to being late for longer periods and ultimately not showing up at all.
  
- **Reason (<R>)**: What reasoning supports the proposition?
  - The reason here seems to be the progressive increase in tardiness leading to complete absence.

### Step 2: Examine the Type of Defective Argument
We now need to classify the argument type as one of the defective argument types: <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>. Let's proceed by evaluating each defective argument type in relation to the given argument.

1. **Generalization (<G>)**:
   - Is there a generalization made from a part or majority to the whole?
   - In this case, the argument does not seem to generalize from a part to a whole demographic but instead presents a sequence of escalating behavior for an individual.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**:
   - Is the argument claiming to enumerate all possibilities but missing some?
   - The argument does not seem to be attempting to enumerate all causes or paths leading to not showing up.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**:
   - Does the reason provided fail to conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition?
   - The reason here is based on a hypothetical progression. It does not provide conclusive evidence that being late for ten minutes will lead to not showing up eventually.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**:
   - Is the causal basis provided not compelling enough?
   - The reasoning given is weak in terms of causal logic; it assumes a progression without substantial evidence that short periods of tardiness will lead inevitably to complete absence.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**:
   - Is the reason a repetition of the proposition?
   - The reason here elaborates on the progression and is not merely a repetition of the proposition.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**:
   - Is it assumed as certain because "it is universally agreed upon"?
   - The argument does not rely on or claim any universal agreement.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**:
   - Can the proof of reason be taken in another sense than intended?
   - The language used in the argument is clear in its intent and isn't ambiguous.

### Step 3: Determine the Most Appropriate Classification
Based on the evaluations above, the argument most closely matches the characteristics of an **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** or an **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**.

### Conclusion
Since the argument provides a reason that is more about hypothetical progression and lacks a compelling causal link, the most appropriate classification would be:

- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**

Thus, the argument type "Today late for ten minutes, tomorrow late for an hour, and then someday you will simply cease to show up" is best classified as **<WCB>**.
