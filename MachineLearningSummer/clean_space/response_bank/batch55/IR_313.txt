For 
To apply IDAA (the application of decomposing an advanced task into specific steps) to IDA (the task of classifying a string as one of the defective argument types), we'll break down the task into specific steps:

1. **Identify the Proposition (P)**:
   - Determine what is being asserted or proposed in the string.

2. **Identify the Reason (R)**:
   - Determine the causal basis provided for the proposition.

3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (PR)**:
   - Determine if there is an additional argument corroborating the reason.

4. **Analyze the components**:
   - Compare the identified components (P, R, PR) with the definitions of the defective argument types (G, FE, IR, WCB, RR, FU, DEP).

5. **Classify the argument**:
   - Based on the comparison, classify the argument as one of the defective types.

Let's apply these steps to the provided string:

> "My brother's girlfriend's Mother's hairdresser said that COVID numbers are going down, so I'm not going to bother with my mask."

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (P)
- The assertion is that the speaker is "not going to bother with my mask."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (R)
- The causal basis given is that "My brother's girlfriend's Mother's hairdresser said that COVID numbers are going down."

### Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason (PR)
- There’s no additional argument corroborating the reason provided.

### Step 4: Analyze the components
- To determine defective argument types, let's see if the given reason and proposition fit any of our defective types definitions:

1. **Generalization (G)**:
   - This doesn't seem to fit, as it’s not a generalization based on one part or a majority applied to all.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**:
   - This doesn’t involve claiming a complete enumeration of possibilities.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**:
   - The reason provided (a hearsay from a distant source) does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition (ceasing to use a mask).

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**:
   - The causal basis (a statement by a non-expert) is very weak for the proposition (ceasing the use of masks).

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**:
   - The reason doesn’t simply repeat the proposition.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**:
   - This isn’t assuming something as universally agreed upon.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**:
   - There's no ambiguous language here, only a reliance on an unreliable source.

### Step 5: Classify the argument
- The best fit for the argument presented in the string is **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**.

The classification is as follows:
> "My brother's girlfriend's Mother's hairdresser said that COVID numbers are going down, so I'm not going to bother with my mask" IS an example of WCB.
