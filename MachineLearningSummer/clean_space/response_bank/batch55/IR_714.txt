For 
To apply <IDAA> and decompose the task of classifying the argument "Because 90% of college students polled had no debt, education costs are not a problem," we need to systematically follow the steps to determine which defective argument type it corresponds to.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition:

**Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>) and Reason (<R>) in the Argument.**
- The Proposition (<P>) is the assertion the argument is trying to prove.
  - In this case: "education costs are not a problem."
- The Reason (<R>) is the justification or causal basis provided for <P>.
  - In this case: "Because 90% of college students polled had no debt."

**Step 2: Check for Defective Argument Types Over Generalization (<G>).**
- Generalization (<G>) would occur if the argument takes a specific case and applies it universally without sufficient justification.
  - Here, the argument assumes that because 90% of students polled (a specific group) have no debt, education costs are not a problem universally. This seems like it might fit <G>.

**Step 3: Check for Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>).**
- Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>) would be relevant if the argument claims to consider all possibilities but misses some.
  - This is not directly applicable here, as the argument doesn’t list possibilities but generalizes based on a poll.

**Step 4: Assess for Inconclusive Reason (<IR>).**
- Inconclusive Reason (<IR>) assesses whether the reason conclusively establishes the proposition.
  - The reason (90% of those polled) does not conclusively show that education costs are universally not a problem.

**Step 5: Look for Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>).**
- Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>) checks whether the reason provides a compelling basis for the proposition.
  - The survey results (90% of students polled) may not be a compelling basis because it doesn’t account for the entire student population or other factors like the representativeness of the sample.

**Step 6: Consider Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>).**
- Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>) happens if the reason is simply a repetition of the proposition.
  - This is not the case here; the reason given (90% of students polled had no debt) is not a mere repetition of the claim (education costs are not a problem).

**Step 7: Check for Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>).**
- Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>) checks if the argument assumes consensus without proper justification.
  - This is not directly applicable here as there is no claim of "universal agreement."

**Step 8: Examine Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>).**
- Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>) would be relevant if the argument's meaning is ambiguous.
  - The argument is quite clear in its wording, so <DEP> is not applicable.

### Step-by-Step Conclusion:
After breaking down the argument into specific steps:

- The argument might fit under **Generalization (<G>)**, because it uses a specific poll result to make a universal claim.
- It also arguably fits under **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)** and **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**, because the survey results do not conclusively prove that education costs are not a problem and the causal basis is weak due to potential lack of representativeness and other unaddressed factors.

For simplicity, the primary classification could be:

- **Generalization (<G>)**: "Because 90% of college students polled had no debt" doesn't necessarily apply to all students, yet it is used to generalize that "education costs are not a problem."
