For 
To apply the IDAA (decomposition of the task IDA into specific steps) to classify the string "We think that Malltime will be a success because all little girls like shopping," follow these steps to systematically determine which defective argument type it falls under:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)
First, identify the part of the argument that sets forth what we intend to prove.

- Proposition (<P>): "Malltime will be a success"

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)
Next, identify the causal basis that is being given to support the proposition.

- Reason (<R>): "all little girls like shopping"

### Step 3: Analyze the Reason (<R>)
Evaluate whether the reason sufficiently supports the proposition. Check for various defects in the reasoning.

### Step 4: Classify the Defective Argument Type
Check the Reason and the Proposition for possible types of defective arguments:

1. **Generalization (<G>)**: Is the Reason based on a generalization that may not apply to all cases?
    - Yes. "all little girls like shopping" is a generalization that may not necessarily apply to every individual little girl.
    
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: Does the Reason miss out on some possibilities while claiming completeness?
    - No. The Reason does not present itself as an enumeration of possibilities.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: Does the Reason fail to demonstrate the correctness of the Proposition conclusively?
    - Potentially. Even if many little girls like shopping, this doesn't conclusively demonstrate that Malltime will be a success (other factors like location, safety, marketing, etc., are also crucial).

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: Is the causal basis for the Reason weak?
    - Potentially. The causal link is weak because the success of Malltime depends on more than just the shopping habits of little girls.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: Does the Reason just repeat the Proposition?
    - No. The Reason is not a repetition of the Proposition.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: Is the Proof of Reason assumed to be universally agreed upon but actually in dispute?
    - No. This argument does not cite universal agreement as proof.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**: Can the Proof of Reason be taken in another sense other than intended?
    - No. The language used here isn't notably ambiguous.

### Step 5: Choose the Most Fitting Defective Argument Type
Review the analysis to identify the most fitting defective argument type.

- The Reason is a **Generalization (<G>)** because it asserts that "all little girls like shopping," but this generalization may not apply to every individual case. Furthermore, the argument's success hinges on the notion that this general preference will directly result in Malltime's success, which is a form of weak reasoning but more explicitly falls under the scope of a generalization.

### Conclusion
Applying IDAA to "We think that Malltime will be a success because all little girls like shopping," we classify it as:

- **<G> (Generalization)**.
