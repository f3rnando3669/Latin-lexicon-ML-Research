To apply the decomposition of the task of classifying the given argument as one of the defective argument types (IDA) step by step (IDAA), we need to break down the task into a sequence of specific steps. Here’s how we can approach it:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (P)
The proposition is the main statement or claim that the argument is trying to establish. In the given argument:
>"I sneezed exactly at the same time the power went off. My sneeze must’ve done something to make the power go off."
The proposition (P) is:
- "My sneeze must’ve done something to make the power go off."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (R)
The reason is the causal basis that is supposed to establish the truth of the proposition. In the given argument:
- "I sneezed exactly at the same time the power went off."

### Step 3: Classify the Defective Argument Type
Now we need to classify the argument into one of the defective argument types:

#### Generalization (G)
- This occurs when an assertion based on some one part or on a majority of individuals is referred to all.
- Not applicable here, as the argument does not generalize from a small sample to a larger population.

#### Incomplete Enumeration (FE)
- This occurs when we claim to have made a complete enumeration of the possibilities but actually miss out on some pertinent ones.
- Not applicable, as the argument doesn't involve enumerating possibilities.

#### Inconclusive Reason (IR)
- This occurs when the reason does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition.
- While arguably applicable, there is a more fitting classification.

#### Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)
- This occurs when a reason is weak because the causal basis for the proposition is not compelling.
- Applicable here because the argument suggests causation based on mere coincidence (sneezing at the same time as the power went off), which is a very weak causal basis.

#### Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)
- This occurs when it appears to present a reason but repeats what was said in the proposition.
- Not applicable, as the reason is different from the proposition.

#### Presumptuous Consensus (FU)
- This occurs when it assumes a proof of reason as certain, on the ground that "it is universally agreed upon."
- Not applicable, as no consensus is invoked.

#### Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)
- This occurs when a proof of reason can be taken in another sense than the speaker intended.
- Not applicable here, as there is no ambiguity in the language used.

### Step 4: Conclusion
Based on the steps above, the given argument is best classified as:

**<WCB> - Insufficient Causal Basis**

- The causal link between the sneeze and the power outage is very weak and unconvincing, resting solely on the timing coincidence.

### Final Classification
The defective argument type for the given statement is **<WCB>**.
