For 
To apply <IDAA> (the application of the decomposition of the task of classification to identifying defective arguments) to the given statement, we need to break down the task into specific steps:

1. **Identify and Understand the Proposition (<P>):**
   - Marvin Stone sets forth the proposition that there is a debate over the best strategy regarding the SALT II treaty, and asks Reagan to explain why his approach is correct.

2. **Identify and Understand the Reason (<R>):**
   - Reagan's response is, "I think I'm right because I believe that we must have a consistent foreign policy, a strong America, and a strong economy."

3. **Identify and Understand the Proof of Reason (<PR>):**
   - Reagan further states, "As we build up our national security, to restore our margin of safety, we at the same time try to restrain the Soviet build-up."

4. **Classify Any Defective Argument:**
   - We need to check if Reagan's response matches any of the defined defective argument types.

- **Generalization (<G>):** No, Reagan does not generalize based on a part or majority but refers to a broader policy stance.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** No, Reagan does not claim an exhaustive list of possibilities.
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** Reagan provides reasons, but these reasons do not directly respond to Stone's specific query about why his approach is objectively better—indicating that the <R> does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the <P>.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** The reasoning provided ("strong America, strong economy") does not compellingly address the specific issue of the SALT II treaty; it’s more about general principles.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** No, Reagan’s reasons differ from the proposition.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** No, Reagan does not assume something is correct because it is universally agreed upon.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):** No, the language used is not ambiguous, but rather broad and general.

After analyzing the argument steps and looking at the defective argument types, Reagan’s response best fits as an **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**. Here’s why:

- Reagan's reasons, although substantive in terms of general policy (strong foreign policy, strong America), do not directly address why scrapping the treaty and intensifying the buildup would necessarily produce a better outcome as compared to Carter’s strategy regarding the SALT II treaty.
- The argumentation does not clearly establish a direct causal link that proves Reagan’s approach is superior in the context of the treaty negotiation, thus being classified as having an inconclusive reason.

So, the logical fallacy illustrated in Reagan’s response is **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**.
