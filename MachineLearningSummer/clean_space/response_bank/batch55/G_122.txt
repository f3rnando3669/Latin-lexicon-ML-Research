For 
To apply <IDAA> to the string "My roommate said her philosophy class was hard, and the one I'm in is hard, too. All philosophy classes must be hard!”, we need to follow a structured approach. The goal is to classify this argument as one of the defective argument types: <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <WCB>, <RR>, <FU>, or <DEP>.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>) in the given argument:**
   - Proposition (<P>): "All philosophy classes must be hard."

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>) supporting the Proposition:**
   - Reason (<R>): "My roommate said her philosophy class was hard, and the one I'm in is hard, too."

3. **Determine if there is a Proof of Reason (<PR>):**
   - Proof of Reason (<PR>): There isn't an explicit additional argument presented as evidence for the Reason.

4. **Analyze the structure of the argument to check for the types of defective arguments (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <WCB>, <RR>, <FU>, <DEP>):**
   - <G> (Generalization): Is the argument making a broad assertion based on a limited number of examples?
   - <FE> (Incomplete Enumeration): Is the argument claiming to cover all possibilities while missing pertinent cases?
   - <IR> (Inconclusive Reason): Is the Reason provided insufficient to conclusively prove the Proposition?
   - <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis): Is the Reason weak due to a non-compelling causal link to the Proposition?
   - <RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition): Is the Reason simply a restatement of the Proposition?
   - <FU> (Presumptuous Consensus): Is the argument assuming universal agreement on something still in dispute?
   - <DEP> (Ambiguous Language Use): Is the Proof of Reason ambiguous or open to multiple interpretations?

### Classification:

After identifying the components and closely analyzing them, it appears the argument commits the faulty reasoning of <G> (Generalization). This is because the Proposition, "All philosophy classes must be hard," is based on the experiences of just two individuals - the speaker and their roommate. The argument is broadly applying the specific experiences of a few to an entire category without sufficient evidence.

### Conclusion:

The given string "My roommate said her philosophy class was hard, and the one I'm in is hard, too. All philosophy classes must be hard!” is classified as <G> (Generalization).

Therefore, the classification under <IDAA> for this argument is: <G>
