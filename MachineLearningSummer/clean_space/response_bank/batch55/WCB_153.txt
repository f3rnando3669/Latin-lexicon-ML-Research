For 
To apply <IDAA> (the decomposition of the task of classifying defective arguments into specific steps) to the given string "The party was going great! Then Gerald showed up and little by little people started collecting their coats and heading home. Gerald ruined the party.", we can break down the process into steps as follows:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition <P>
The Proposition (P) is the main statement or claim that the argument is trying to prove. 

In this case:
- <P>: "Gerald ruined the party."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason <R>
The Reason (R) sets forth the causal basis for the Proposition, establishing why the Proposition is true.

In the string:
- <R>: "Then Gerald showed up and little by little people started collecting their coats and heading home."

### Step 3: Determine if there is any Proof of Reason <PR>
Proof of Reason (PR) would provide additional support to the Reason, validating the Reason with further arguments.

In the string:
- There is no explicit Proof of Reason provided.

### Step 4: Evaluate the Defective Argument Types 
Using the definitions provided, classify the argument as one of the defective argument types.

#### Generalization (<G>)
- <G>: The argument involves a general assertion based on some or a majority but not necessarily all individuals.
- **Evaluation**: This doesn't apply here. The argument isn't making a generalization about a group based on a subset.

#### Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)
- <FE>: The argument claims a complete enumeration of possibilities but misses some relevant ones.
- **Evaluation**: This doesn't apply here. There's no claim about a complete enumeration of possibilities.

#### Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)
- <IR>: The Reason does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the Proposition.
- **Evaluation**: This could apply. While the Reason provided points to a correlation (people leaving after Gerald's arrival), it does not conclusively demonstrate causation (that Gerald was the cause of people leaving).

#### Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)
- <WCB>: The causal basis submitted for the Proposition is weak and not compelling.
- **Evaluation**: This applies because the Reason given (people leaving after Gerald showed up) is not a strong, irrefutable causal basis for concluding that Gerald ruined the party. It suggests a correlation but not definitive causation.

#### Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)
- <RR>: The Reason appears as though it's supposed to be new information but merely repeats the Proposition.
- **Evaluation**: This doesn't apply since the Reason does not simply restate the Proposition.

#### Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)
- <FU>: The Proof of Reason is assumed certain on the ground that it's universally agreed upon but still in dispute.
- **Evaluation**: This doesn't apply since there is no Proof of Reason to be assumed as universally agreed upon.

#### Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)
- <DEP>: The Proof of Reason can be taken in another sense than intended.
- **Evaluation**: This doesn't apply since there is no ambiguous language in the Reason provided.

### Step 5: Conclusion
After evaluating the provided definitions and the given argument, the most suitable classification of the defective argument type is:

- **<IR>**: Inconclusive Reason - it fits because the Reason provided does not conclusively demonstrate that Gerald's arrival was the cause of people leaving the party (there's a failure to compellingly link causation from mere correlation).
- **<WCB>**: Insufficient Causal Basis - it fits because the causal basis provided (Gerald arriving and people leaving) is weak and does not compellingly establish that Gerald ruined the party.

Therefore, the argument can be classified as both <IR> (Inconclusive Reason) and <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis).
