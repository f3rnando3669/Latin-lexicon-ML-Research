Certainly! To apply the task of classifying "Albert Einstein was extremely impressed with this theory" as one of the defective argument types using the methodology defined as <IDAA> (decomposition of the classification task into specific steps), we'll break down the process as follows:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition of IDA (Classifying Defective Argument):

1. **Identify the Proposition (P)**:
   - We need to identify whether there is a proposition and what it is. 
   - In this case, the proposition <P> can be understood as an implicit statement: "This theory is valid or superior because Albert Einstein was extremely impressed with it."

2. **Determine the Argument Type**:
   - Compare the statement to the definitions of each defective argument type: <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, and <DEP>.

3. **Analyze the Reason (R)**:
   - Determine the causation or reason (if any) provided that explains why the proposition should be accepted.

4. **Match to Defective Argument Types**:
   - Generalization (<G>): Does this apply a general conclusion from a limited situation? 
   - Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>): Does this claim completeness without considering all options?
   - Inconclusive Reason (<IR>): Is the reason inconclusive for the proposition?
   - Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>): Is there a weak causal relationship between the reason and the proposition?
   - Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>): Does the reason merely restate the proposition?
   - Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>): Is the argument based on an assumed consensus?
   - Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>): Is there ambiguity in the reasoning or language used?

### Application of IDAA to Given Statement:

**Step 1: Identify the Proposition (P)**
- The implied proposition <P> is: "This theory is valid or superior."

**Step 2: Determine the Argument Type**
- The given statement directly cites that "Albert Einstein was extremely impressed with this theory."

**Step 3: Analyze the Reason (R)**
- The reason provided is: "Albert Einstein was extremely impressed with this theory." This serves as the rationale for accepting the proposition.

**Step 4: Match to Defective Argument Types**
1. **Generalization (G)**: No, there is no generalization present in the statement.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: No, the statement does not claim completeness through exhaustive possibilities.
3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The reason here is based on the opinion of a highly respected figure, but it does not conclusively prove the validity of the theory. It relies on authority rather than factual evidence.
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: Yes, while Einstein's impression is meaningful, it is not a compelling causal basis for scientifically establishing the theory's validity.
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: No, the reason does not restate the proposition.
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: No, it does not claim a universal agreement or consensus.
7. **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: No, the language is clear and not ambiguous.

**Conclusion from IDAA**:
The statement "Albert Einstein was extremely impressed with this theory" most closely aligns with the defective argument type **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**. The reason provided does not offer a compelling causal basis to establish the validity of the proposition that the theory is correct. It relies on an appeal to authority rather than evidence and sound reasoning.
