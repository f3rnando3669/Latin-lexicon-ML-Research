For 
To apply the task of decomposition (D) to the task of identifying the type of defective argument (IDA) present in the string "Old Major's speech claiming that ALL the animals will unite and revolt against the humans", we will follow these steps systematically.

### Step 1: Understand the Propositions and Reasoning presented in the argument

**Proposition (P)**:
Old Major claims that all the animals will unite and revolt against the humans.

**Reason (R)**:
The reason implied is that all animals have a common cause or grievance against humans which should naturally lead them to unite and revolt.

### Step 2: Analyze the Defective Argument Types and See Which One Fits

1. **Generalization (G)**: An assertion based on some or a majority of individuals, but not all, is referred to all.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: Claiming a complete enumeration of possibilities but missing out on some pertinent ones.
3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The causal reason doesn't conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition.
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: The reason given is weak or not compelling enough as a basis for the proposition.
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: The reason is essentially a repetition of the proposition.
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: Assuming proof on the basis that "it is universally agreed upon" when it’s still in dispute.
7. **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: The proof can be taken in another sense than the speaker intended.

### Step 3: Identify the Relevant Defective Argument Type

**Evaluating the Proposition and Reason:**

- **Generalization (G)**:
  Old Major's assertion that **all** animals will unite and revolt seems to be a generalization. It's based on the assumption that all animals share the same sentiments and will act identically, which may not be true for each individual animal.
   
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**:
  The argument does not seem to fit here as it doesn’t involve listing out possibilities.

- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**:
  The reason "common grievance" might not explicitly or conclusively lead to the action of uniting and revolting.

- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**:
  There might be some validity here if the reason (common grievance) is not deemed a compelling enough reason for all animals to unite and revolt.

- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**:
  The reason "common grievance" isn't merely restating the proposition "all animals will unite and revolt."

- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**:
  There's no mention of universal agreement in Old Major's statement.

- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**:
  The language here doesn’t inherently seem ambiguous in terms of multiple interpretations being feasible.

### Step 4: Conclude the Classification of the Defective Argument

Based on the above analysis, the defective argument type that fits "Old Major's speech claiming that ALL the animals will unite and revolt against the humans" is:

- **Generalization (G)**: Old Major generalizes that because some or even many animals might share grievances against humans, all animals will inevitably unite and act in a particular way (revolt).

Thus, <s> "Old Major's speech claiming that ALL the animals will unite and revolt against the humans" is of type <G> (Generalization).
