For 
To apply IDAA (the decomposition of the task IDA into specific steps) to the given argument, let's proceed step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Proposition (P):**
   The statement intended to be proved in the argument is:
   - "Playing video games causes teens to be violent."

2. **Identify the Reason (R):**
   The reason that supports the proposition is:
   - "Video game playing among teens has risen the last five years."
   
   The implicit assumption here is that the increase in video game playing is causing the increase in violence among teens.

3. **Identify any Proof of Reason (PR):**
   There is no explicit Proof of Reason provided in the argument. 

Next, we need to classify this argument (s) into one of the defective argument types.

1. **Analyze if the Proposition (P) is classified as Generalization (G):**
   The proposition does rely on a generalized claim that playing video games causes teens to be violent. However, this alone isn't enough to classify it under G without more context on the scope of individuals the claim is referring to.

2. **Analyze if the Proposition (P) is classified as Incomplete Enumeration (FE):**
   The argument doesn’t present a complete enumeration of possibilities. It ignores other potential factors contributing to violence among teens.

3. **Analyze if the Reason (R) is classified as Inconclusive Reason (IR):**
   Yes, the Reason provided does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the Proposition. Correlation between the rise in video game playing and the rise in teen violence does not necessarily imply causation. There could be other factors at play.

4. **Analyze if the Reason (R) is classified as Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):**
   Yes, the Causal Basis is weak. The causal relationship suggested between video game playing and increased violence is not compelling and lacks substantive evidence. The argument assumes causation based solely on correlation.

5. **Analyze if the Reason (R) is classified as Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):**
   The Reason does not merely repeat the Proposition. It attempts to provide a basis, though a weak one.

6. **Analyze if the Proof of Reason (PR) could be classified as Presumptuous Consensus (FU):**
   There isn’t an explicit Proof of Reason claiming universal agreement on this point.

7. **Analyze if the Proof of Reason (PR) could be classified as Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):**
   There is no ambiguous language misuse detected in the Proof of Reason because it isn't given in the argument.

**Conclusion:**
Based on the analysis, the argument "Violence among teens has risen the last five years. Video game playing among teens has also risen the last five years. Therefore, playing video games causes teens to be violent." is best classified as having the following defective argument types:

- **IR (Inconclusive Reason)**: The Reason does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the Proposition.
- **WCB (Insufficient Causal Basis)**: The Reason provided for the Proposition lacks a compelling causal linkage.

Applying IDAA has thus led us to conclude the argument mainly suffers from being IR and WCB.
