For 
To apply <IDAA> (the decomposition of the task of classifying a defective argument into specific steps) to the given statement, we need to follow the decomposition approach. This involves breaking down the more general task of classifying the defective argument into smaller, more manageable steps. Here’s how we can do it:

**Step 1: Break down the statement into its main parts.**
- "I am voting for Smith for President."
- "My whole family is Democrat, so I'll be voting that way, too."

**Step 2: Identify the Proposition (<P>) and the Reason (<R>).**
- Proposition (<P>): "I am voting for Smith for President."
- Reason (<R>): "My whole family is Democrat, so I'll be voting that way, too."

**Step 3: Evaluate the Reason (<R>).**
- The reason given is essentially that the speaker’s family affiliation with the Democratic Party influences their voting choice.

**Step 4: Classify the Reason (<R>) based on the defined defective argument types:**
- **Generalization (<G>):** This doesn’t generalize from a part to a whole in terms of the subject matter, so this doesn’t fit.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** This is not an enumeration of possibilities, so it doesn’t fit.
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** This type is where the reason provided does not conclusively support the proposition. In this case, the familial party affiliation provided does not necessarily demonstrate why Smith, in particular, should be voted for.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** This matches because the reason "my family is Democrat" is not a compelling basis for voting for Smith per se. The reason does not delve into the qualifications or policies of Smith.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** The reason is not a repetition of the proposition; rather, it offers additional information.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** The argument is not appealing to universal agreement.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):** The argument does not hinge on ambiguous language.

**Step 5: Determine the most appropriate classification.**
- The Reason (<R>) does not conclusively support the Propositon (<IR>), and it has an insufficient causal basis (<WCB>).

**Conclusion:**
- The primary defective argument here seems to fit best as **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)** because the familial political affiliation is not a compelling reason for voting for Smith.

Therefore, the statement "I am voting for Smith for President. My whole family is Democrat, so I'll be voting that way, too." is classified as having an Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>).
