For 
To apply the decomposition technique <IDAA> to the task of classifying the string "Discoveries from Archimedes should be dismissed because he made them in a bathtub and not a proper university laboratory," we need to break down the task into specific steps and then follow these steps systematically. Below is a step-by-step decomposition for this classification task:

1. **Understand the Proposition (<P>):**
   - Identify the main statement or claim that is being put forth.
   - In this case, the main statement is: "Discoveries from Archimedes should be dismissed."

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   - Determine the reason provided to support the main proposition.
   - Here, the reason given is: "because he made them in a bathtub and not a proper university laboratory."

3. **Classify the Argument Type (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>):**
   - Analyze the reason to see why it might be faulty or defective.

Let's analyze step-by-step:

### Step 1: Understand the Proposition (<P>)
- The proposition is: "Discoveries from Archimedes should be dismissed."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)
- The reason given is: "because he made them in a bathtub and not a proper university laboratory."

### Step 3: Classify the Argument Type
- We need to determine which, if any, of the defined defective argument types this falls under.

**Analysis:**

1. **Generalization (<G>):**
   - The argument does not present a generalization of specific cases to a broader population.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):**
   - The argument does not seem to be missing possibilities in an enumeration.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):**
   - The reason given does not seem to provide a conclusive rationale for dismissing Archimedes’s discoveries. The location where Archimedes made his discoveries (bathtub vs. laboratory) does not necessarily influence the validity or importance of the discoveries themselves. This points towards <IR>, because the reason given is not sufficient to support the proposition conclusively.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):**
   - The causal connection between the location of Archimedes’s discovery and the validity of those discoveries is not strong. It is weak and not compelling, indicating an insufficient causal basis. This suggests it could also be classified as <WCB>.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):**
   - The reason does not simply repeat the proposition.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):**
   - The argument does not appeal to a presumed universal agreement.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):**
   - There is no ambiguous language present; the language is clear and straightforward.

**Conclusion:**
Given the analysis, the defective argument type identified is primarily **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason)**, because the reason provided is not sufficient to dismiss Archimedes’s discoveries. It could also be argued to be **<WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis)** considering the weak causal link between the setting of the discovery and the validity of the discovery itself.

Thus, the string "Discoveries from Archimedes should be dismissed because he made them in a bathtub and not a proper university laboratory" is classified as primarily <IR> (Inconclusive Reason) and potentially also <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis).
