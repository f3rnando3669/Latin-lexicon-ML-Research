Alright, let's apply <IDAA> to the string "Beware of appeals made only to your feelings and not to your logic." We'll first decompose the task <IDA> into specific steps and then apply these steps to classify the string.

### Decomposition of <IDA> into specific steps (<D>):
1. **Identify Proposition <P>**: Summarize what the statement intends to prove.
2. **Identify Reason <R>**: Determine the causal basis for establishing the truth of <P>.
3. **Identify Proof of Reason <PR>**: Look for any additional arguments that corroborate the Reason.
4. **Classify Potential Defective Arguments**:
   1. Generalization <G>
   2. Incomplete Enumeration <FE>
   3. Inconclusive Reason <IR>
   4. Insufficient Causal Basis <WCB>
   5. Faulty Repetition of Proposition <RR>
   6. Presumptuous Consensus <FU>
   7. Ambiguous Language Use <DEP>

### Application of <D> to the string:

#### Step 1: Identify Proposition <P>
The proposition here can be summarized as: "You should be wary of appeals made only to your feelings and not to your logic."

#### Step 2: Identify Reason <R>
The reason could be inferred as: "Appeals only to your feelings are less reliable or valid than those appealing to your logic."

#### Step 3: Identify Proof of Reason <PR>
There doesn't seem to be an explicit proof of reason in the given string. We only have the assertion that one should be wary of such appeals, but there are no additional arguments or evidence provided to corroborate this assertion.

#### Step 4: Classify Potential Defective Arguments

The string presents us with a cautionary statement but lacks detailed reasoning or proof. Based on the definitions given, we can classify this type of argument:

1. **Generalization <G>**: The statement isn’t asserting something about all appeals, so it doesn’t qualify as a generalization to all from a part.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration <FE>**: The statement does not claim to enumerate all possibilities, so it doesn’t fall under incomplete enumeration.
3. **Inconclusive Reason <IR>**: There is no detailed reasoning provided to conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition about appeals to feelings versus logic.
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis <WCB>**: The reason provided, though implicit, does not have a compelling causal basis without further elaboration.
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition <RR>**: The string does not merely restate the proposition as the reason.
6. **Presumptuous Consensus <FU>**: The statement does not claim universal agreement for support.
7. **Ambiguous Language Use <DEP>**: The language used in the statement is clear and specific, so it does not qualify as ambiguous language use.

Given the provided definitions and analysis, the best fit appears to be:

- **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason)**: The cautionary claim "Beware of appeals made only to your feelings and not to your logic" presents a proposition but does not provide a conclusive reason for why this is the case. Without further evidence or argument, the reason for distrust is not adequately demonstrated.

Thus, the classification of the string "Beware of appeals made only to your feelings and not to your logic." is:
**<IR> (Inconclusive Reason)**.
