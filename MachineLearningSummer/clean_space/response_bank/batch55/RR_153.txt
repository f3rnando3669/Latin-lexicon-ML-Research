For 
To apply IDAA to "A is true because A is true," we need to decompose the task of classifying this string into specific steps. Here's the step-by-step process:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)

First, identify the proposition provided in the argument. In this case:
- **Proposition (<P>):** A is true.

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)

Next, determine the reason given to support the proposition:
- **Reason (<R>):** A is true.

### Step 3: Determine if <R> Supports <P>

Evaluate whether the reason provided is valid and properly supports the proposition:
- **Evaluation:** The reason, "A is true," is the same as the proposition itself, "A is true," providing no new information or causal basis.

### Step 4: Classify the Type of Defective Argument

Using the definitions of defective arguments, classify the given argument:
- According to <RR>, a weak reason occurs when it merely restates the proposition without providing additional support. The reason here simply repeats the proposition verbatim.

### Conclusion

Given the evaluation, classify the argument as follows:
- **Classification:** <RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition)

### Step-by-Step Summary

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):** A is true.
2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):** A is true.
3. **Evaluate if <R> supports <P>:** The reason ("A is true") is the same as the proposition and does not provide additional support.
4. **Classify the Defective Argument:** The argument fits the definition of <RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition).

Therefore, applying IDAA to "A is true because A is true" results in classifying it as <RR>.
