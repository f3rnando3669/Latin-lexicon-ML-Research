For 
Let's apply the IDAA (the decomposition of the task of classifying a string as one of the defective argument types) to the phrase "Live with me or live on the streets."

### Step-by-Step Decomposition:

#### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (P)
Determine what is being asserted or put forward as the main point in the string.

**Proposition (P):** The main assertion in the string is a conditional statement: "Live with me or live on the streets."

#### Step 2: Identify the Reason (R)
Determine if there is a causal basis provided for the proposition. Analyze what reasons or evidence are being given that support the proposition.

**Reason (R):** There is an implied causality here that if you do not live with the speaker, the only alternative is to live on the streets. This suggests a situation of dependency or lack of other options.

#### Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason (PR)
Determine any evidence or additional arguments used to bolster the reason. Check for additional proof or justification for the reason provided.

**Proof of Reason (PR):** There is no explicit additional proof or corroborating argument provided in the string. It is assumed that no other viable options exist.

#### Step 4: Evaluate for Defective Argument Types
Compare the identified parts with the previously defined defective argument types to classify the string accordingly.

- **Generalization (G):** Does the proposition apply to all cases based on just a few or one part?
  - No, this does not fit because it is not based on some one part or majority applied to all.
  
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** Does the proposition claim to enumerate all possibilities but miss pertinent ones?
  - Yes, this fits because "Live with me or live on the streets" presents a dichotomy that falsely limits the range of possible living arrangements. It does not consider other legitimate options like living with friends, relatives, finding a different apartment, etc. It assumes these are the only two possibilities, which is an incomplete enumeration.

- **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** Does the reason fail to conclusively prove the proposition?
  - This could also somewhat fit because the reason (lack of alternative options) is not conclusively proven, but it looks like this is secondary to the incomplete enumeration.

- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** Is the reason not a compelling causal basis for the proposition?
  - This does not directly fit as the issue lies more with false dichotomy than the weak causal basis.

- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** Does the reason just restate the proposition?
  - No, it does not fit as the reason and proposition are not repetitions.

- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** Is it assuming consensus on a disputed matter?
  - No, thereâ€™s no claim of universal agreement.

- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** Is there ambiguity in the language use?
  - No significant ambiguity in the given statement.

### Conclusion
The defective argument type that best fits "Live with me or live on the streets" is **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)** because it incompletely enumerates the possibilities, falsely presenting two options as the only choices.

Thus, the string "Live with me or live on the streets" is classified as <FE> based on the application of IDAA.
