To apply the process of <IDAA>—the application of task decomposition to the identification and classification of defective arguments—to the given statement "Global warming doesn’t exist because the earth is not getting warmer," we will decompose the task step by step.

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition <P>

First, identify the main assertion or claim that is being made in the statement, which would be the proposition <P>.
- **Proposition <P>:** "Global warming doesn’t exist"

### Step 2: Identify the Reason <R>

Next, identify the reason presented to support the proposition <P>.
- **Reason <R>:** "because the earth is not getting warmer"

### Step 3: Evaluate the Reason <R> and its Correlation to the Proposition <P>

Now, evaluate the relationship between <R> and <P> to determine if it falls under any defective argument types.

- The reason given ("the earth is not getting warmer") does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition ("Global warming doesn’t exist"). Scientific consensus and data indicate that global warming involves more complex processes than simple changes in average temperature; it includes trends and patterns in climate.
- The argument should establish a compelling causal basis for the proposition by substantiating why "the earth is not getting warmer" definitively disproves "Global warming."

### Step 4: Classify the Defective Argument

Review the types of defective arguments described and determine which one applies to the statement:

1. **Generalization (G):** Making an assertion based on a part but not applicable to all.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** Claiming a complete enumeration of possibilities but missing some.
3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** Reason does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition.
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** Causal basis for the Reason is not compelling.
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** Reason is a repetition of the proposition.
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** Assuming proof on the grounds of universal agreement.
7. **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** Proof can be taken in another sense than intended.

Here, the reason given does not conclusively prove the proposition because it misrepresents the complexity of global warming. Therefore, the types most closely related are:

- **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** The reason does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** The reason does not provide a compelling causal argument.

### Conclusion

Apply the type classification:

- The statement "Global warming doesn’t exist because the earth is not getting warmer" is classified as both **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** and **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)** because the given reason does not conclusively demonstrate nor compellingly support the proposition.
