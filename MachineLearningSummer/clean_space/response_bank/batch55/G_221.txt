For 
Applying \(\text{IDAA}\) (the decomposition of \(\text{IDA}\) into specific steps) to the statement "If we allow a housing development to be built on Sunny Lake, a resort will come next, and soon we won’t have any wilderness left!" involves several steps. Let's perform the decomposition of \(\text{IDA}\) and classify the argument type of the given statement.

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (\(P\))
First, identify the main assertion that is intended to be proved. 

- Proposition (\(P\)): Building a housing development on Sunny Lake will lead to no wilderness left.

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (\(R\))
Next, identify the reason given for the proposition.

- Reason (\(R\)): A resort will come next after the housing development.

### Step 3: Identify the Type of Defective Argument
Analyze the structure of the argument to determine if it falls into any of the defective argument categories: <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>.

1. **Generalization (\(G\))**: This argument does not generalize from one or a few cases to many.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (\(FE\))**: This argument isn't making an enumerative claim about all possibilities.
3. **Inconclusive Reason (\(IR\))**: This looks closely applicable. The reason provided does not conclusively demonstrate that a housing development will necessarily lead to no wilderness left. It assumes a chain of events will occur without providing evidence for those steps.
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (\(WCB\))**: This also seems applicable. The causal connection between a housing development leading directly to no wilderness left is weak without supporting evidence.
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (\(RR\))**: This doesn't repeat the proposition as the reason.
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (\(FU\))**: This doesn't rely on a presumed consensus.
7. **Ambiguous Language Use (\(DEP\))**: The language is not obviously ambiguous.

### Step 4: Classify Based on Evidence and Context
Based on step 3, classify the argument type.

- **Inconclusive Reason (\(IR\))**: The reason provided does not logically entail the conclusion without more evidence.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (\(WCB\))**: The chain of causation from a housing development to no wilderness left is weakly supported.

### Final Classification
After evaluating steps and evidence:

The argument "If we allow a housing development to be built on Sunny Lake, a resort will come next, and soon we won’t have any wilderness left!" is primarily classified under **Insufficient Causal Basis (\(WCB\))** because the given reason does not provide a compelling causal basis that building a housing development will inevitably lead to the complete loss of wilderness. It can also be seen as **Inconclusive Reason (\(IR\))** since the reason provided does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition.

Thus, we can classify the argument as \( \mathbf{WCB} \) with a secondary consideration for \( \mathbf{IR} \).
