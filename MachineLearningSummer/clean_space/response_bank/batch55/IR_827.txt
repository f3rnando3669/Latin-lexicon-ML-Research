To apply the advanced task of decomposing (D) the task of classifying (IDA) the string provided, we will take the following steps:

1. **Identify the Propositions (P) in the string:**
   - *Son: I am so excited! I got an “A” on my physics exam!*
     - Proposition (P1): The son is excited because he received an "A" on his physics exam.
   - *Dad: Why not an “A+”? This means that you answered something incorrectly. That is not acceptable!*
     - Proposition (P2): The son did not get an “A+” because he answered something incorrectly.
     - Proposition (P3): Answering something incorrectly is not acceptable.

2. **Identify the Reasons (R) in the string:**
   - *Dad: Why not an “A+”? This means that you answered something incorrectly.*
     - Reason (R1): The reason for not getting an “A+” is that something was answered incorrectly.

3. **Identify any Proofs of Reasons (PR) in the string:**
   - In the provided string, there is no explicit Proof of Reason (PR). The dad’s statement assumes the proposition (P2) directly from the reason (R1) without additional arguments.

4. **Classify potential Defective Argument Types based on the Propositions and Reasons identified:**
   - Determine if any of the propositions (P) or reasons (R) fit into defective argument types.

   - **Proposition (P2): The son did not get an “A+” because he answered something incorrectly.**
     - This directly leads to the conclusion that (R1) is true. 
     - There is no additional reasoning given that could conclusively establish it. It assumes the correctness of the dad's belief without any substantial evidence. This seems to lack a complete enumeration of possibilities.
     - **Defective Argument Type:** Incomplete Enumeration (FE). There could be many reasons why the son did not get an A+, which the father has not considered.

   - **Proposition (P3): Answering something incorrectly is not acceptable.**
     - This statement is a personal judgment or a belief of the dad without any reason presented to support why answering something incorrectly is unacceptable under all circumstances.
     - **Defective Argument Type:** Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB). The causal basis (reason) for why something incorrect is unacceptable is not compelling in itself.

5. **Consolidate findings:**
   - Proposition (P2) with reason (R1) shows signs of Incomplete Enumeration (FE).
   - Proposition (P3) demonstrates Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB).

Therefore, the application of IDAA to the provided string yields the classification:
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)** for the assertion that the son did not get an “A+” because of answering something incorrectly.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)** for the assertion that answering something incorrectly is not acceptable.
