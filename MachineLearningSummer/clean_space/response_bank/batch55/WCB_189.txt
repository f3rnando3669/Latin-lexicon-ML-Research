For 
To apply IDAA (decomposition of the task of classifying the defective argument) to the given argument, we'll break down the process step by step.

### Step 1: Identify the Argument Structure
First, let's break down the argument into its components:
- **Proposition (P)**: I refuse to stay on the 13th floor of any hotel because it is bad luck.
- **Reason (R)**: The 13th floor is bad luck.
- **Conclusion/Implication**: However, I don’t mind staying on the same floor as long as we call it the 14th floor.

### Step 2: Evaluate Possible Defective Argument Types
Now we need to evaluate which defective argument type(s) might apply to the argument.

1. **Generalization (G)**: Does the argument overgeneralize based on a limited observation?
   - The proposition doesn't directly apply a generalization to a majority or all cases without sufficient evidence.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: Does the argument miss out on some pertinent possibilities?
   - The argument doesn’t claim to have enumerated all possibilities and missed some out.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: Does the reason not conclusively prove the proposition?
   - The notion that the 13th floor is "bad luck" is a superstition and does not provide a scientifically or logically conclusive basis for the proposition.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: Is the causal basis submitted for the proposition weak or unconvincing?
   - The superstition related to the number 13 does not provide a compelling causal basis for refusing to stay on the 13th floor.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: Does the reason merely repeat the proposition without adding new information?
   - The argument doesn’t simply repeat the proposition.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: Is there an assumption of universal agreement on something disputed?
   - The claim that the 13th floor is bad luck is based on a widely held superstition but not universally agreed upon.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: Could the proof of reason be interpreted in multiple ways?
   - The statement isn’t using ambiguous language in a way that would confuse the interpretation of the argument.

### Step 3: Classify the Defective Argument
Based on the above evaluation, the most applicable defective argument types for this argument are:

- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**

The argument claims that staying on the 13th floor is bad luck without providing a conclusive or compelling reason as to why this is so, relying instead on superstition.

### Conclusion
The classification of the given argument "I refuse to stay on the 13th floor of any hotel because it is bad luck. However, I don’t mind staying on the same floor as long as we call it the 14th floor." is:

- **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason)**
- **<WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis)**

These classifications are reflective of the superstition-based reasoning which doesn’t provide a strong or conclusive causal basis.
