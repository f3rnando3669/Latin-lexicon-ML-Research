For 
To apply \( <IDAA> \) to the given string \( <s> \):

1. **Identify the Proposition \( <P> \)**: The proposition here is "global warming is not actually happening."

2. **Identify the Reason \( <R> \)**: The reason provided for the proposition is "the research of one environmental scientist who has been studying climate change for several years."

3. **Identify Proof of Reason \( <PR> \)**: The proof of reason is implicitly the citation of this one environmental scientist's research.

Having identified \( <P> \), \( <R> \), and \( <PR> \), let's classify the string \( <s> \):

### Analyze for Defective Argument Types:

1. **Generalization \( <G> \)**:
   - The argument uses the research of one environmental scientist to make a broad claim about global warming. This is a generalization because it bases its conclusion on the findings of one individual without considering the larger body of scientific research.
   - This fits the definition of \( <G> \), where \( <P> \) is an assertion based on some one part but referred to all.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration \( <FE> \)**:
   - The argument does not claim a complete enumeration of all scientific research or perspectives, but rather focuses on one environmental scientist.
   - This does not necessarily fall under \( <FE> \).

3. **Inconclusive Reason \( <IR> \)**:
   - The argument does not provide a comprehensive basis for its claim, relying solely on the research of one expert without additional evidence.
   - This fits the definition of \( <IR> \), as \( <R> \) does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of \( <P> \).

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis \( <WCB> \)**:
   - The causal basis here is thin; relying on one scientist out of many who study climate change is not a compelling or sufficient basis.
   - This fits the definition of \( <WCB> \), where \( <R> \) submits a weak causal basis.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition \( <RR> \)**:
   - The reason is not simply a repetition of the proposition, so this does not fit under \( <RR> \).

6. **Presumptuous Consensus \( <FU> \)**:
   - The argument does not state that the claim is universally agreed upon. Thus, it does not fall under \( <FU> \).

7. **Ambiguous Language Use \( <DEP> \)**:
   - The argument appears straightforward without ambiguity in language use, so it does not fit under \( <DEP> \).

### Conclusion:
The string \( <s> \) primarily fits the defective argument types \( <G> \), \( <IR> \), and \( <WCB> \). The argument relies on a generalization based on one scientist's research, lacks conclusive reasoning, and has an insufficient causal basis.
