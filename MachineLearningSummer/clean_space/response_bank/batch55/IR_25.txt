For 
To apply <IDAA> to the given statement "The Volkswagen Beetle is an evil car because it was originally designed by Hitler's army," we will decompose the task of classifying the string as any type of defective argument into specific steps.

### Steps to Classify the Defective Argument (<IDA>):
1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
   - Determine the main assertion or claim being made.

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   - Determine the causal basis or justification provided for the Proposition.

3. **Classify the Form of Defective Argument:**
   - Assess if the argument falls into any of the defective types defined: <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>.

### Step-by-Step Application to Given Statement:

#### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)
The Proposition in the given statement is:
   - **"The Volkswagen Beetle is an evil car."**

#### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)
The Reason provided for the Proposition is:
   - **"because it was originally designed by Hitler's army."**

#### Step 3: Classify the Form of Defective Argument
We need to evaluate the argument against each type of defective argument to determine which one applies:

1. **Generalization (<G>):**
   - **Assessment:** The statement does not appear to involve a generalized claim based on a subset being referred to all. Therefore, this does not fit <G>.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):**
   - **Assessment:** The argument does not seem to enumerate possibilities or claim completeness. Therefore, this does not fit <FE>.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):**
   - **Assessment:** Whether designed by Hitler's army conclusively demonstrates the car as "evil" is questionable. This looks like the reason does not conclusively prove the proposition.
   - **Conclusion:** This might be <IR>.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):**
   - **Assessment:** The reasoning that being designed by Hitler's army is a sufficient cause for labeling the car as "evil" seems weak and unconvincing.
   - **Conclusion:** This might be <WCB>.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):**
   - **Assessment:** The Reason does not merely restate the Proposition. Therefore, this does not fit <RR>.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):**
   - **Assessment:** The argument does not rely on general consensus or an assumed agreement on the point. Therefore, this does not fit <FU>.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):**
   - **Assessment:** There is no apparent ambiguity in the language used. Therefore, this does not fit <DEP>.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the argument most likely falls into:
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** The Reason provided does not conclusively demonstrate that the Volkswagen Beetle is evil.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** The causal basis (originally designed by Hitler's army) is not sufficiently convincing to substantiate the claim (evil car).

Given these two possibilities, we can prioritize <WCB> as the more fitting classification since it directly questions the sufficiency of the causal basis provided. Thus, the defective argument type is:

**"Insufficient Causal Basis" (<WCB>)**
