For 
To apply IDAA (the application of decomposing the task into specific steps) to classify the given string into the defective argument types <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>, we can follow these steps:

1. **Understand the Propositions and Arguments:**
   - Identify the primary Proposition (P) in the discussion.
   - Identify any Reasons (R) that support the Proposition.
   - Identify any Proof of Reason (PR) that corroborates the Reason.

2. **Analyze Charlie's Statement:**
   - Proposition (P): "Fast food is filled with salt, fat, and added sugars. We need better regulation of the industry."
   - Reason (R): Implicit reasoning appears to be that since fast food is unhealthy (filled with salt, fat, and sugars), it necessitates regulation.

3. **Analyze Bob's Response:**
   - Bob's response does not address the causal basis or proof of the original proposition directly. Instead, it attacks Charlie's credibility.
   - Bob's counter-argument: "That may be, but you’re such a hypocrite! I saw you devour a Triple-Baconator, super-sized fries, and 64 ounces of soda yesterday."

4. **Classify the Defective Argument:**
   - The focus of Bob's response is an ad hominem attack, not a direct refutation of the argument. Given our types, this doesn't fit exactly into the provided defective argument categories but reflects more as a distraction tactic.
   - We need to choose the closest defective argument type given our list (Generalization, Incomplete Enumeration, Inconclusive Reason, Insufficient Causal Basis, Faulty Repetition of Proposition, Presumptuous Consensus, Ambiguous Language).
   
   Let's assess compatibility:

   **Generalization (G):** This type doesn't apply because Bob's argument does not generalize from a small sample.

   **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** Bob is not listing possibilities; hence, this doesn’t apply.

   **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** This argues against the premise without conclusive evidence, but Bob’s response is not providing inconclusive reason about the health impacts directly.

   **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** This is about weak causal arguments, not applicable to ad hominem.

   **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** Bob’s attack is not a repetition of Charlie’s argument.

   **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** Neither Bob nor Charlie are assuming universal agreement.

   **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** No ambiguous language is used.

5. **Determine the Closest Match:**
   - Since Bob’s argument is focused on hypocrisy rather than directly addressing the argument about the regulation of fast food, we can consider that it indirectly fails to provide a conclusive reason to rebut Charlie's proposition.
   
   **Conclusion:** The closest defective argument type in this context is **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**, as Bob's rebuttal fails to directly and conclusively address the correctness of the proposition about the need for better regulation in the fast food industry.

Therefore, applying IDAA, the classification of Bob's argument is closest to type **<IR>**.
