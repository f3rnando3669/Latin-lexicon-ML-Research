For 
To apply IDAA (decomposition approach) to IDA (the task of classifying the string as a specific defective argument type), we will break down the task into specific steps and then proceed step-by-step:

### Decomposition Steps:
1. **Identify and Extract Components**: Determine and extract the different parts (Proposition <P>, Reason <R>, Proof of Reason <PR>) from the given argument or dialogue.
2. **Evaluate the Proposition**: Assess whether the Proposition <P> is clear and specific.
3. **Analyze the Reason**: Examine if the Reason <R> provided supports the Proposition <P>.
4. **Corroborate the Proof of Reason**: Check if there is any Proof of Reason <PR> and verify its relevance and correctness.
5. **Classify Argument Type**: Based on the analysis, classify the argument as one of the defective argument types (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>).

### Step-by-Step Application:

**Step 1: Identify and Extract Components**

In the given dialogue:
- **Teacher (Prop):** "Why don’t you have your homework today?"
- **Student (Reply):** "Well, I did my homework. I was actually really interested in all that info about the quadratic formula. Would you like to hear the song that I wrote to memorize it?"

Here, the Teacher’s question implies the Proposition <P>: The student is expected to have their homework.

**Step 2: Evaluate the Proposition**

- **Proposition <P>:** "You should have your homework today."
- This is implied rather than directly stated, and it is clear and specific in the context given by the teacher's expectation.

**Step 3: Analyze the Reason**

- **Reason <R>:** The student says, "Well, I did my homework."
- Does this Reason <R> support the Proposition <P>? Here, the student claims to have done the homework but does not address why they don't have it to present. This does not provide a conclusive answer to the teacher’s question.

**Step 4: Corroborate the Proof of Reason**

- **Proof of Reason <PR>:** The student mentions being interested in the quadratic formula and offers a song they wrote to memorize it. This is not directly related to the reason why the homework is not present.
- This statement does not corroborate the initial reason meaningfully, as it digresses into an unrelated topic (interest in the quadratic formula).

**Step 5: Classify Argument Type**

- **Evaluating Defective Argument Types**:
  - **Generalization (<G>)**: Not applicable since there is no overgeneralization based on partial evidence.
  - **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: Not applicable, as the statement is not claiming a complete enumeration of possibilities.
  - **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The Reason <R> does not conclusively explain why the homework isn’t present, which seems applicable.
  - **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The reason provided is not sufficient or compelling in response to the Proposition.
  - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: There is no exact repetition; the student’s response is different from the original question.
  - **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: There is no consensus assumed in the student's argument.
  - **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**: The argument does not appear to use ambiguous language.

Based on the step-by-step analysis, **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)** appears to be the most fitting classification. The student’s response does not directly address why the homework isn’t present, making the reasoning inconclusive.

### Conclusion:
After applying the decomposition approach to classify the argument, we identify the argument type as **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**.
