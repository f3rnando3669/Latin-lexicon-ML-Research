Let's decompose the task of classifying the given string using the specified defective argument types (G, FE, IR, WCB, RR, FU, DEP). We will follow a systematic approach to break down this analysis step by step.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (D) of the Task (IDA)

1. **Identify the Proposition (P):**
   - Determine the main assertion or claim being made.

2. **Identify the Reason (R):**
   - Determine the causal basis provided for the proposition.

3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (PR):**
   - Identify additional arguments or evidence that support the reason.

4. **Classify Defective Argument:**
   - Examine the string to identify if and how it fits into any of the defective argument types:
      - **G (Generalization)**
      - **FE (Incomplete Enumeration)**
      - **IR (Inconclusive Reason)**
      - **WCB (Insufficient Causal Basis)**
      - **RR (Repetition of Proposition)**
      - **FU (Presumptuous Consensus)**
      - **DEP (Ambiguous Language Use)**

Now, let's apply these steps to the given string:

### Given String
"There is ... a radical element, a homosexual agenda that wants to redefine what marriage is. They want to say that a marriage not only is one man and one woman but it is two men or it is two women. What logical reason is there to keep us from stopping expansion of that definition to include three people or an adult and a child, or any other odd combination that we want to have?  ... and it does not even have to be limited to human beings by the way. I mean it could be anything. ... There is no reason why we cannot just completely erase whatever boundaries that currently exist on the definition of marriage and say it is a free-for-all, anything goes."

#### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (P)
- **Proposition (P):** The assertion that redefining marriage to include same-sex couples will lead to redefining marriage to include any combination of individuals or even non-human entities.

#### Step 2: Identify the Reason (R)
- **Reason (R):** The expansion of the definition of marriage to include same-sex couples will logically lead to the expansion of marriage to any combination of people (or non-human entities) without boundary.

#### Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason (PR)
- **Proof of Reason (PR):** The speculative examples provided (three people, an adult and a child, non-humans) are used to support the reason.

#### Step 4: Classify Defective Argument
- **Generalization (G):** The argument generalizes from the proposed legal recognition of same-sex marriage to an extreme and unrelated set of possibilities without sufficient basis.
  - **Analysis:** The conclusion that recognizing same-sex marriage will lead to recognizing all conceivable unions is not substantiated by evidence. It assumes that all forms of marriage are equally likely to be recognized without considering the specific social, ethical, and legal contexts.
  
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** Not directly applicable since the argument does not claim to enumerate possibilities exhaustively.
  
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** The reason does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition.
  - **Analysis:** The causal link between recognizing same-sex marriages and the recognition of any other combination is speculative and lacks conclusive evidence. The slippery slope argument fails to establish that recognizing same-sex marriage will necessarily lead to the scenarios described.

- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** The causal basis for the proposition is not compelling.
  - **Analysis:** The reasons given for the expansion of the definition of marriage are weak and do not provide a strong causal link to the proposition. The argument presumes a slippery slope without justifying why such a progression is inevitable or likely.

- **Repetition of Proposition (RR):** Not directly applicable since the reason is not simply a repetition of the proposition.

- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** Not directly applicable since the argument does not rely on a presumed universal agreement.

- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** The language about "anything goes" may be somewhat ambiguous, but it is primarily an exaggeration rather than ambiguity intended to deceive.

### Conclusion
Based on the classification analysis, the argument best fits the categories:
- **Generalization (G)**
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**

Thus, the given string primarily exhibits the defective argument types **G** (Generalization), **IR** (Inconclusive Reason), and **WCB** (Insufficient Causal Basis).
