For 
To apply the process of IDAA (decomposition of the task of identifying argument fallacies in a string) to the string "Everyone uses Social Media to fundraise, therefore there's no problem with asking for money on social media sites as long as it's going to charity," we need to take the task IDA and break it down into specific steps. These steps will allow us to classify the string according to one of the defective argument types defined earlier.

Let's go through the steps:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (P)
First, identify the Proposition (P) in the argument.
- **Analysis**: The proposition here seems to be "there's no problem with asking for money on social media sites as long as it's going to charity."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (R)
Next, locate the Reason (R) provided to support the Proposition (P).
- **Analysis**: The reason given is "Everyone uses Social Media to fundraise."

### Step 3: Assess the Structural Soundness
Evaluate whether the reason structurally supports the proposition. Check for generalization, enumeration issues, conclusiveness, causal basis, repetition, presumption, or ambiguity.
- **Analysis**: The reason "Everyone uses Social Media to fundraise" is purported to universally apply without evidence that it is true for every single individual or situation.

### Step 4: Determine General Nature of Defective Arguments
Identify the nature of the defect based on our definitions.
- **Generalization (G)**: Assertion that applies to all based on some.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: Claims to be complete but misses some possibilities.
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: Reason is not conclusive enough.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: Weak causal basis.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: Proposition and Reason are identical.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: Assumed as certain due to consensus.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: Ambiguity in proof's language.

### Step 5: Match With Defective Arguments
Compare the nature of the given argument with the types of defective arguments.
- **Comparison**: The reason "Everyone uses Social Media to fundraise" can be seen as a Generalization (G) because it takes a specific or common practice and asserts it as universally applicable without evidence that it holds for everyone.

### Step 6: Conclusion
Based on the steps above, we can conclude the fallacy present in the argument "Everyone uses Social Media to fundraise, therefore there's no problem with asking for money on social media sites as long as it's going to charity."

### Conclusion
The given string shows evidence of the **Generalization (G)** fallacy.
