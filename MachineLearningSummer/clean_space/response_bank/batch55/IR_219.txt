For 
To classify the given string "Word processed papers are clearer and more error-free than typed papers because they make use of new technology" using the IDAA method, we need to decompose the classification task into specific steps. Here are the steps for applying IDAA (the application of decomposition to the task of identifying defective arguments):

1. **Identify the Proposition (P):**
   - The string makes a claim or assertion about the topic.
   - **Proposition (P):** "Word processed papers are clearer and more error-free than typed papers."

2. **Identify the Reason (R):**
   - The string provides a reason to support the proposition.
   - **Reason (R):** "Because they make use of new technology."

3. **Classify the argument based on defective types:**
   - Determine if the given proposition, reason, or the overall reasoning fits any of the defective argument types defined.
   
4. **Apply each defective type definition to the argument:**
   - **Generalization (G):** The statement does not claim that it's based on a specific part or majority.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** The statement does not attempt to enumerate possibilities.
   - **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** The statement needs evaluation regarding whether the reason conclusively supports the proposition.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** Evaluate if the use of new technology is a compelling reason for why word processed papers are clearer and more error-free.
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** The reason does not repeat the proposition.
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** The statement does not make a claim of universal agreement.
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** Check if the reason can be taken in another sense than intended.

5. **Analyze and Determine:**

Let's analyze the argument with these steps:

- **IR Analysis:**
  - Does the reason provided ("they make use of new technology") directly and conclusively demonstrate that word processed papers are clearer and more error-free?
  - The use of new technology might not be a sufficiently direct or strong reason to conclusively prove the proposition.
  
- **WCB Analysis:**
  - Is the reason "they make use of new technology" a compelling causal basis for the proposition?
  - The use of new technology does provide some benefit, but it may not be sufficiently compelling to fully justify the claim without further explanation or supporting evidence.

Based on this analysis, it appears the argument may suffer from **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** and **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**, as the reason given does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition and is not a compelling causal basis without more context or evidence.

Therefore, we classify the argument as: **<IR> and <WCB>**.
