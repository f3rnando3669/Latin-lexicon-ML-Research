For 
To apply IDAA (the application of decomposition of a task into specific steps to the task of classifying a string as a defective argument type) to the string "Either you believe what I’m saying, or you must believe exactly the opposite," we first need to decompose the task of identifying the argument's defectiveness into specific steps. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (P)
The first step in decomposing an argument is to identify the main proposition, or what the argument is trying to prove.

**Proposition (P)**:
"Either you believe what I’m saying, or you must believe exactly the opposite."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (R)
The reason (R) provides the basis or justification for the proposition.

**Reason (R)**:
In this case, the string doesn't provide a clear causal basis or reason for the proposition. It is more of a forced dichotomy.

### Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason (PR)
To fully evaluate the argument, identify if there is any proof or evidence supporting the reason.

**Proof of Reason (PR)**:
There is no additional proof or supporting evidence provided in the string.

### Step 4: Determine the Type of Defective Argument
Compare the identified elements against the definitions of defective argument types to classify the argument as one of the defect types:

1. **Generalization (G)**: The argument is not generalizing based on incomplete information.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: This argument does not claim to enumerate all possibilities, so it's not incomplete enumeration.
3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The argument does not provide a reason at all in the first place.
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: Similar to IR, there's no causal basis provided for making the choice, so this doesn't completely fit.
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: The argument is not repeating the Proposition as a Reason.
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: The argument does not assume consensus to prove its validity.
7. **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: The language isn't particularly ambiguous but rather it presents a false dichotomy.

### Step 5: Evaluate for Additional Logical Fallacies
Given that none of the provided classifications seem to fit perfectly, this might be a case of introducing another common logical fallacy:

- **False Dichotomy (Bifurcation)**: The argument presents only two extreme options as the only possibilities, without considering any alternative or middle grounds. This often forces an illogical choice between two options which are not mutually exhaustive.

### Conclusion
By decomposing the task of identifying the defective argument type, we conclude that the string "Either you believe what I’m saying, or you must believe exactly the opposite." represents a logical fallacy known as:

**False Dichotomy (Bifurcation)**,

which is not explicitly listed within the original set of defective argument types provided, but it indeed fits the logical fallacy paradigm since it incorrectly restricts the choices to two options. However, based on the given defective types, the existing classifications might not comprehensively capture this fallacy, indicating an edge case or the necessity of expanding the defect types list.
