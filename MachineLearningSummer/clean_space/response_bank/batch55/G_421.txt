For 
To apply <IDAA> to the given statement, we need to decompose the task of classifying the argument into specific steps. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)
Determine what the main claim or assertion of the argument is.
- **Proposition (<P>): "Basketball practice will always be easy."**
  
### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)
Determine the Reason given for the Proposition.
- **Reason (<R>): "My first day of basketball practice was easy."**

### Step 3: Understand the Logical Connection
Analyze how the Reason is being used to support or justify the Proposition.
- The Reason is used to generalize the experience from the first day to every future instance of basketball practice.

### Step 4: Identify if the Argument is Defective
Determine if the argument has one of the defective types defined: <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>.

1. **<G> - Generalization**: Does the argument generalize based on limited experience?
   - Yes, it generalizes from a single instance (the first day) to all instances (all future practices).

2. **<FE> - Incomplete Enumeration**: Does the argument claim completeness but miss possibilities?
   - Not particularly applicable here, as the argument doesn't claim to exhaustively consider all possibilities but generalizes instead.

3. **<IR> - Inconclusive Reason**: Does the reason not conclusively support the proposition?
   - The reason is inconclusive because one day’s experience is not sufficient to draw a definitive conclusion about all future practices. However, this overlaps significantly with Generalization.

4. **<RR> - Faulty Repetition of Proposition**: Does the reason simply repeat the proposition?
   - No, the reason is not merely a repetition of the proposition.

5. **<WCB> - Insufficient Causal Basis**: Is the causal basis weak or uncompelling?
   - The basis is weak for generalizing all future practices based on a single instance, but this also falls under the Generalization.

6. **<FU> - Presumptuous Consensus**: Does it assume universal agreement misleadingly?
   - No, it doesn’t rely on assumed consensus.

7. **<DEP> - Ambiguous Language Use**: Is there ambiguity in the language used?
   - No significant ambiguity is present in the terms used.

### Step 5: Determine the Defective Argument Type
Given the analysis, the most fitting defect type is:
- **<G> - Generalization**: The argument makes a sweeping generalization based on a single instance.

### Conclusion
The given statement "My first day of basketball practice was easy, so it will always be easy" is of type <G> (Generalization).

So, by applying IDAA to this statement, we have decomposed the task and identified that it is a defective argument of type <G>.
