For 
To apply the advanced task of IDAA (decomposition of IDA into specific steps) to classify the string "Everyone loves going to the movies," we need to break down the steps required to identify the type of defective argument used. Here is how we can proceed step by step:

**Step 1: Analyze the proposition \( P \) within the given string \( s \)**

- \( s \): "Everyone loves going to the movies."
- In this context, the proposition \( P \) is "Everyone loves going to the movies." 

**Step 2: Determine if the proposition \( P \) fits any defective argument type**

1. **Generalization \( G \)**
   - **Definition:** An assertion based on some part or a majority of individuals, but not necessarily applicable to all, is referred to all.
   - **Analysis:** The statement "Everyone loves going to the movies" is a sweeping assertion that generalizes everyone's preferences based on an incomplete basis. Not every individual loves going to the movies, so it potentially asserts without sufficient or universal evidence. This fits the nature of a generalization.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration \( FE \)**
   - **Definition:** Claiming to have made a complete enumeration of possibilities but missing out on some pertinent ones.
   - **Analysis:** The statement doesn't enumerate possibilities but rather makes a blanket statement.

3. **Inconclusive Reason \( IR \)**
   - **Definition:** \( R \) does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of \( P \).
   - **Analysis:** There appears to be no explicit Reason \( R \) given in the string that would demonstrate the correctness of \( P \).

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis \( WCB \)**
   - **Definition:** \( R \) is weak if the causal basis which it submits for \( P \) is not compelling.
   - **Analysis:** As there is no \( R \) provided in the string, this defective argument doesn't apply.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition \( RR \)**
   - **Definition:** \( R \) weakly repeats what is said in \( P \).
   - **Analysis:** Since there is no \( R \) provided, this type does not apply either.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus \( FU \)**
   - **Definition:** \( PR \) is assumed as certain because "it is universally agreed upon."
   - **Analysis:** There is no \( PR \) or reference to universal agreement; the statement is a blanket assertion.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use \( DEP \)**
   - **Definition:** \( PR \) can be taken in another sense than intended.
   - **Analysis:** The statement does not seem ambiguous in its language.

**Step 3: Conclude the classification**

Among the defective argument types considered, "Everyone loves going to the movies" fits the type **Generalization (G)** because it makes a broad assertion about everyone's preferences based on an assumption that may not apply universally.

Thus, according to the steps, we can classify the given string \( s \) as being of type **Generalization (G)**.
