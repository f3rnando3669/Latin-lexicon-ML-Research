To apply the process of breaking down the task of classifying a given string as a defective argument into specific steps, here’s how we can approach it:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition of the Task (IDAA)
1. **Identify the Proposition (P):**
   - What is the main assertion being made?

2. **Identify the Reason (R):**
   - What is the causal basis or reasoning provided to support the proposition?

3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (PR):**
   - Is there additional evidence or argument that corroborates the reason?

4. **Classify the Defective Argument:**
   - Compare the identified parts (P, R, PR) with the definitions of defective argument types (G, FE, IR, RR, WCB, FU, DEP).
   - Determine which type of defective argument the string represents.

### Applying the Steps to the Given String: "Everyone does it. You should too."

#### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (P)
The main assertion here is: "You should do it."

#### Step 2: Identify the Reason (R)
The reasoning provided is: "Everyone does it."

#### Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason (PR)
There is no additional evidence or argument provided to corroborate the reason; it is simply stated as a fact.

#### Step 4: Classify the Defective Argument

Evaluate the types of defective arguments for the given string:

- **Generalization (G):**
  - This isn't exactly a case of applying a characteristic based on some to all.

- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):**
  - No enumeration of possibilities is provided, so this is ruled out.

- **Inconclusive Reason (IR):**
  - The reason "everyone does it" does not conclusively demonstrate why one should also do it.

- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):**
  - The causal basis that everyone’s doing it is not compelling enough to conclude one should do it too.

- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):**
  - The reason does not seem to repeat the proposition precisely.

- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):**
  - The reason "everyone does it" assumes consensus without proof, implying that what the majority does is correct.

- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):**
  - No ambiguous language appears in the string; the terms are quite clear.

Based on this comparison:

The string "Everyone does it. You should too." most closely matches the definition of **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**. It assumes that because it is universally agreed upon (everyone does it), the action is justified and should be followed.

### Conclusion
Thus, the string "Everyone does it. You should too." is classified as **<FU>** (Presumptuous Consensus).
