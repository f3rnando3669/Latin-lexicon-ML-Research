For 
To apply IDAA (the application of decomposition to the task of identifying defective arguments) to the statement "Studies show that it takes up to seven years for the human body to digest a piece of gum," we will decompose the task of classifying the argument step by step.

1. **Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)** 
   - The proposition here is the main claim or statement being asserted. 
   - In this case, the proposition is: "It takes up to seven years for the human body to digest a piece of gum."

2. **Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)**
   - We need to identify the causal basis or reason given for the Proposition.
   - The reason given is: "Studies show."

3. **Step 3: Identify if there is Proof of Reason (<PR>)**
   - We need to check if additional arguments are provided to support or corroborate the Reason.
   - In this statement, no detailed proof or additional arguments are presented to support "studies show." The claim is presented without specific evidence from studies.

4. **Step 4: Classify the Argument Type**
   - Next, we classify the argument based on potential defects using the categories provided.

**Defective Argument Types Consideration:**
- **Generalization (<G>):** There is no indication that this argument is based on a small or unrepresentative sample. This is more about presenting an authoritative claim.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** There are no enumerations of possibilities here.
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** The reason "studies show" may not conclusively demonstrate that it takes seven years to digest gum.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** The causal basis "studies show" might be weak or insufficient without specific study references.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** The reason does not simply repeat the proposition; it adds "studies show."
- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** There is no explicit statement of universal agreement.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):** The phrase "studies show" could potentially be taken ambiguously if we do not know which studies, but primarily this is a statement about the Reason.

**Step 5: Determining the Most Likely Defective Argument Type**
- Given the above analysis, the most relevant defective argument type for this case is:
  - **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** The reason provided, "studies show," is weak because it does not give a compelling or detailed causal basis. We have no information about which studies, the quality of the studies, or how they support the proposition.

Thus, the classification of the argument "Studies show that it takes up to seven years for the human body to digest a piece of gum" is **<WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis)**.
