For 
To apply IDAA (the application of decomposition to the task of classifying a string as a defective argument type) to the statement "My doctor is overweight, so I don't believe anything he tells me about improving my health," we will break down the task into specific steps as follows:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (P) and Reason (R)
- **Proposition (P):** "I don't believe anything he tells me about improving my health."
- **Reason (R):** "My doctor is overweight."

### Step 2: Determine the relation between P and R. Identify if there's any subsequent <PR> (Proof of Reason).
- The reason given doesn't appear to have additional supporting arguments, so <PR> doesn't apply directly. The statement hinges directly on the reason provided.

### Step 3: Analyze the Reason (R) for defects.
- **Generalization (G):** Is the assertion based on a part applicable to all? No, it does not seem to generalize based on partial information to all doctors or health advice.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** Does it claim a complete set of possibilities? No, this does not apply here.
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** Does the reason fail to conclusively demonstrate the proposition? Yes. The reason (doctor being overweight) does not conclusively demonstrate that health advice is incorrect or should be disregarded.
  
### Step 4: Evaluate the causal basis for inadequacies.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** Is the causal basis submitted for the proposition compelling? No, the fact that the doctor is overweight doesn't provide a compelling basis for dismissing their health advice entirely.

### Step 5: Check for faulty repetition or misuse of agreement.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** Does the reason repeat the proposition in different terms? No, the reason and proposition aren’t just circular repetitions.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** Does it assume universal agreement for what is still in dispute? No, universal agreement is not claimed.
  
### Step 6: Check for ambiguous language.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** Is the proof of reason taken in another sense than intended? No ambiguous language is detected in this string.

### Step 7: Conclude with the primary defect and justify.
Based on the analysis:

- **Primary Defect:** Inconclusive Reason (IR) and Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)
- **Justification:** The statement "My doctor is overweight, so I don't believe anything he tells me about improving my health" has an inconclusive reason. There is no logical or necessarily correct link between the doctor's weight and the truthfulness or effectiveness of their health advice. Additionally, the causal basis (that the doctor’s weight undermines their advice) isn't a compelling one.

Thus, the defective arguments in the given string are primarily of type **IR** (Inconclusive Reason) and **WCB** (Insufficient Causal Basis).
