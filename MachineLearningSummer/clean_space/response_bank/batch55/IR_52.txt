For 
To apply \( IDAA \) to the string "Dr. X is an engineer, and he doesn’t believe in global warming," we'll decompose the advanced task \( IDA \) (classifying the string as one of the defined defective argument types) into specific steps. Each step will carefully analyze the given string to classify it appropriately.

### Decomposition of \( IDA \) into Specific Steps (\( D \)):

1. **Identify the Proposition (\( P \))**:
   Determine what the statement is asserting or trying to prove.

2. **Identify the Reason (\( R \))**:
   Identify the causal basis or rationale provided for the proposition.

3. **Classify the Reason (\( R \))**:
   Evaluate the reason in terms of its effectiveness and relevance.

4. **Apply Defective Argument Criteria**:
   Check the identified reason against the defective argument types (\( G \), \( FE \), \( IR \), \( WCB \), \( RR \), \( FU \), \( DEP \)) to find the closest match.

### Application of \( IDAA \) to "Dr. X is an engineer, and he doesn’t believe in global warming":

#### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (\( P \))
The proposition appears to be:
- We should question or reject the validity of global warming.

#### Step 2: Identify the Reason (\( R \))
The reason given is:
- Dr. X is an engineer, and he doesn’t believe in global warming.

#### Step 3: Classify the Reason (\( R \))
We need to evaluate the effectiveness and relevance of the reason. Here, \( R \) attempts to leverage the authority or expertise of Dr. X as an engineer to cast doubt on global warming.

#### Step 4: Apply Defective Argument Criteria

1. **Generalization (\( G \))**: 
   This argument doesn't seem to be claiming that because Dr. X doesn't believe in global warming, all engineers or all people should believe the same. Thus, it doesn't match the definition of a generalization.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (\( FE \))**: 
   The argument doesn't attempt to list all engineers or other experts who have an opinion on global warming, so it's not missing pertinent possibilities in an enumeration.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (\( IR \))**: 
   We need to check if the reason (Dr. X's disbelief) conclusively demonstrates the correctness of the proposition (questioning global warming). Dr. X's personal belief is not sufficient to conclusively prove or disprove global warming, making the reason inconclusive.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (\( WCB \))**: 
   The causal basis (an engineer's disbelief) is not robust enough to conclude global warming is false. There is no scientific evidence provided, just an appeal to authority.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (\( RR \))**: 
   The reason does not simply restate the proposition.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (\( FU \))**: 
   The argument does not claim universal agreement on Dr. X's belief.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (\( DEP \))**: 
   There doesn’t seem to be ambiguous language in a way that affects the understanding of the argument.

### Conclusion: Classify as \( IR \) and \( WCB \)
- The argument "Dr. X is an engineer, and he doesn’t believe in global warming" should be classified as both \( IR \) and \( WCB \).

#### \( IR \): Inconclusive Reason
- Dr. X's disbelief does not provide conclusive proof against global warming.

#### \( WCB \): Insufficient Causal Basis
- The rationale that an engineer's personal disbelief is not a compelling reason to reject scientific consensus on global warming.
