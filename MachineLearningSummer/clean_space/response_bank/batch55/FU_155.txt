For 
Let's apply <IDAA> to the statement "McDonald's Hamburgers: over 99 billion served" by breaking down the task of classifying it as one of the defective argument types. Here's how the decomposition (<D>) can proceed:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)
First, we'll identify the proposition in the statement. The proposition is a declarative part of the argument that states what we intend to prove or establish.

In the given statement, the proposition (<P>) can be identified as:
"McDonald's has served over 99 billion hamburgers."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)
Next, we look for a reason that establishes the truth of the proposition. The reason should provide some causal basis for the proposition. In this context, the statement doesn't explicitly provide a reason, but it intends to imply something about the quality or popularity of McDonald's due to this high number.

Given that:
There isn't an explicit causal basis for the proposition provided in the string itself.

### Step 3: Evaluate Potential Proofs of Reason (<PR>)
We do not have an explicit proof of reason provided within the given statement. A <PR> would typically provide additional arguments to corroborate the reason.

Given that:
No explicit additional arguments or evidence are provided in the statement.

### Step 4: Identify Applicable Defective Argument Types
Now, we will evaluate the statement against each defective argument type to classify it appropriately.

1. **Generalization (<G>)**:
   - Does the statement generalize a characteristic that may not necessarily apply to all?
   - No, the statement provides a specific number.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**:
   - Does the statement claim to list all possibilities but miss some critical ones?
   - No, it's a numerical assertion about hamburgers served.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**:
   - Does the reason provided fail to conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition?
   - There's no explicit reason provided.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**:
   - Is the causal basis for the proposition weak or not compelling?
   - Again, no explicit causal basis is given.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**:
   - Does the reason simply repeat the proposition without offering new support?
   - No, because there's no explicit reason provided to repeat.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**:
   - Does the statement assume something is universally agreed upon which is still in dispute?
   - No, it's a factual claim.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**:
   - Could the statement be taken in another sense than intended by the speaker?
   - No, the number seems straightforward and not open to multiple interpretations.

### Step 5: Classify the Argument
Based on the evaluation, the statement "McDonald's Hamburgers: over 99 billion served" does not fall cleanly into any of the defective argument types we've defined. It doesn't provide supporting reasons, additional arguments to corroborate those reasons, or explicitly defective reasoning. It seems to be a straightforward factual claim without the components that would typically make it a complete argument or a defective one under the specified types.

### Conclusion
The statement "McDonald's Hamburgers: over 99 billion served" does not classify under any defective argument type defined by <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <WCB>, <RR>, <FU>, or <DEP>. If forced to choose, one might argue it represents an **Argument by Assertion**, but this is outside the defined classifications.
