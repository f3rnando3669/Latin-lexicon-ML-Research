For 
Certainly, let's break down the task <IDAA> into specific steps, and then apply it to the given string. 

First, we need to decompose the task of classifying a statement by following specific steps.

### Decomposition Steps for <IDA>:
1. **Identify the Proposition (P)**: Determine the main assertion or proposition in the statement.
2. **Identify the Reason (R)**: Determine the reasoning or causal basis provided for the proposition.
3. **Identify Proof of Reason (PR)**: Check for any additional corroborative arguments supporting the reason.
4. **Check for Defective Argument Types**: Evaluate if the argument falls into any of the predefined defective types (G, FE, IR, RR, WCB, FU, DEP).

### Application to the Given String:
#### Given String: "If you lie, then you will end up in jail."

#### Step-by-Step IDAA Application:

1. **Identify the Proposition (P)**:
   - Proposition: "You will end up in jail."

2. **Identify the Reason (R)**:
   - Reason: "If you lie."

3. **Identify Proof of Reason (PR)**:
   - In this case, there's no additional proof or reasoning provided beyond the causal link mentioned.

4. **Check for Defective Argument Types**:

   - **Generalization (G)**: This doesn't apply because the statement isn't making a generalized assertion based on a part or majority.
   
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: This doesn't apply because the statement isn't claiming a complete list of possibilities.
   
   - **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: This could potentially apply since the reason "If you lie" may not conclusively demonstrate that you will necessarily end up in jail (there could be other factors and situations where lying does not lead to jail time).
   
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: This could be an applicable type, because the causal link (lying leading to jail) is not particularly compelling without further context or explanation.

   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: This doesn't apply because the reason is different from the proposition.
   
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: This doesn't apply as there's no claim of universal agreement.
   
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: This doesn't apply as the language in the statement is fairly straightforward and not ambiguous.

#### Conclusion:
The statement "If you lie, then you will end up in jail." can best be classified under **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** because the reasoning does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition. It could also potentially fall under **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**, as the causal link asserted is not compelling on its own.
