Certainly, let's proceed step by step to decompose our advanced task <IDA> applied to this specific string.

### Step 1: Understand the Task IDA
The task of classifying a string as one of the defective argument types involves identifying the nature of the fallacy within the argument. The defective argument types are:

1. **Generalization (<G>)**
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**
3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**
7. **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**

### Step 2: Analyze the Given String
The given string is: "The statement 'you are not really an American if you are vegetarian' is an example of which fallacy?"

### Step 3: Break Down the Statement to Understand the Underlying Reasoning
To classify it correctly, we need to break down the statement and see which of the defective argument types it aligns with.

1. **Proposition (<P>):** 
   - "You are not really an American if you are vegetarian."
   - This is the main assertion that is being argued.

2. **Reason (<R>):**
   - The statement implies that there is an inherent characteristic of Americans which excludes vegetarians from being 'really American.'
   
### Step 4: Match the Statement Against Each Defective Argument Type

1. **Generalization (<G>):**
   - Does it make a broad assertion based on insufficient evidence? Yes. The statement seems to assume that all Americans consume meat, which is a stereotype and doesn't hold true for every individual.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):**
   - Does the statement claim a complete set of possibilities, missing out on pertinent ones? No. It doesn't enumerate all possibilities but makes a direct assertion.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):**
   - Does the reason provided fail to conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition? Yes. The reason that being vegetarian means one is not 'really American' is weakly supported and not conclusive.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):**
   - Does the reason fail to provide a compelling causal basis for the proposition? Yes. The idea that dietary habits define national identity is a weak causal basis.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):**
   - Does the reason merely restate the proposition? No. It doesn't just repeat but implies a weak argument around identity.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):**
   - Is the proposition presumed true based on a supposed universal agreement? No. It does not rely on a supposed consensus but makes a direct claim.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):**
   - Could the statement be taken in another sense than intended? No. The statement is relatively clear in its intended (though flawed) meaning.

### Step 5: Conclusion and Classification
After breaking down and analyzing the statement against the defective argument types, we find it most closely matches:

- **Generalization (<G>)**: It makes a broad and unsupported claim about what defines being 'American' based on dietary habits, which is an overgeneralization.
  
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The reason given does not adequately support the proposition. The idea that being vegetarian disqualifies someone from being 'really American' is not a conclusive argument.

- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The causal link between diet and national identity is weak and unconvincing.

Thus, the statement can be considered as primarily fitting the Generalization (<G>) fallacy with overlaps into Inconclusive Reason (<IR>) and Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>).

### Final Classification
"The statement 'you are not really an American if you are vegetarian'" is an example of **Generalization (<G>)**, with significant aspects of **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)** and **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**.
