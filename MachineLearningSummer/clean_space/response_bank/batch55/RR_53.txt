For 
To apply the process of IDAA (the application of task decomposition to the task of identifying defective arguments) to the string "Repeating the same thing as if you’re proving something," we'll take the following steps:

1. **Understand the String**:
   - The string implies a scenario where someone repeats an assertion without providing new or valid reasoning as if they are proving something.

2. **Identify Argument Components**:
   - The statement highlights a redundancy between Proposition (P) and Reason (R).

3. **Classify the Defective Argument**:
   - We need to match the observed defect with one of the predefined defective argument types (G, FE, IR, RR, WCB, FU, DEP).

Let's break down each step:

### Step 1: Understand the String
The string "Repeating the same thing as if you’re proving something" suggests a repetition of the Proposition as the Reason without actually adding any new information or supportive reasoning.

### Step 2: Identify Argument Components
Here are the components in focus:
- **Proposition (P)**: The original assertion.
- **Reason (R)**: The supposed causal basis that should confirm the truth of the Proposition.

According to the string, the Reason (R) is merely a repetition of the Proposition (P).

### Step 3: Classify the Defective Argument
Considering the string, we need to identify the appropriate known defective argument type:

- **Generalization (G)**: Irrelevant because it pertains to applying a characteristic of some individuals to all.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: Irrelevant because it relates to incomplete listing.
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: Close but not perfect. Inconclusive reasons are weak but not necessarily repetitive.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: Also close, as it refers to weak causal relationships, but doesn't precisely match the repetition problem.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: Directly relevant. This defective argument type describes a scenario where the Reason (R) repeats the Proposition (P) without providing new or valid reasoning.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: Irrelevant because it deals with assumptions of universal agreement.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: Irrelevant because it pertains to ambiguous phrasing.

### Conclusion
The string "Repeating the same thing as if you’re proving something" is best classified as a case of **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**, where the Reason (R) fails by simply echoing the Proposition (P).

### Summary of IDAA for the given string
- **Step 1**: String analyzed as suggesting redundant repetition.
- **Step 2**: Identified the redundancy between components P and R.
- **Step 3**: Classified as **RR** (Faulty Repetition of Proposition).

Thus, based on the IDAA process, the string falls into the defective argument category of **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**.
