For 
To apply the decomposition of the task into specific steps (IDAA) to classify the given string as one of the identified defective argument types, we'll break it down as follows:

1. **Identify the Proposition <P>:** 
   - The Proposition here is "Kentucky will beat Florida."

2. **Identify the Reason <R>:**
   - The Reason given is "John sometimes lies."

3. **Evaluate the type of Reason (R):**
   - The Reason makes a character judgment about John but doesn't provide factual information relevant to the sporting event outcome.

4. **Consider whether the Reason conclusively supports the Proposition:**
   - The statement "John sometimes lies" doesn't conclusively establish anything about the outcome of the Kentucky vs. Florida game. It is merely attacking John's credibility without directly addressing the proposition.

5. **Classify the defective argument type:**

   Let's go through each defective argument type to find the best match:
   
   - **Generalization (G):** This doesn't fit, as there's no unfounded generalization about a group.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** This doesn't fit either, as the argument doesn't involve missed possibilities.
   - **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** This seems plausible because the reason given (that John sometimes lies) doesn't conclusively demonstrate why the proposition (Kentucky will beat Florida) should be doubted or believed.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** This could also be a match since the causal basis (John sometimes lies) is weak and not compelling for doubting the proposition.
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** This doesn’t fit; the reason doesn’t repeat the proposition.
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** This doesn't apply since there's no assumption of universal agreement.
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** This doesn’t fit since there’s no ambiguous language here.

Given the reasoning:
- The argument mostly falls under **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** because the reason (John sometimes lies) doesn't give a direct verdict on the truth of the proposition (Kentucky will beat Florida).

Therefore, the application of IDAA to the string "John says that Kentucky will beat Florida, but John sometimes lies, so I'm not sure." results in classifying it as Inconclusive Reason \(<IR>\).
