For 
To apply the given definitions and classification process step by step, we first need to break down the task <IDA> (identifying the type of defective argument) using the decomposition technique <D>. Here, we perform <IDAA> (the application of <D> to <IDA>) to classify the argument "Everybody loves Raymond because he is so popular. Popular people are loved by everybody."

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition <P>
The proposition is the main statement that we intend to prove. In this case, it is:
- **Proposition <P>:** Everybody loves Raymond.

### Step 2: Identify the Reason <R>
The reason is the causal basis set forth to establish the truth of the proposition. Here, it is:
- **Reason <R>:** Because he is so popular.

### Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason <PR>
The proof of reason corroborates the reason by means of additional arguments. Here, it is:
- **Proof of Reason <PR>:** Popular people are loved by everybody.

### Step 4: Classify the Argument
Now we classify the entire argument "Everybody loves Raymond because he is so popular. Popular people are loved by everybody." as one of the defective argument types:

- Does it fall under **Generalization (G)**? No, it does not seem to generalize based on some part or a majority to all.
  
- Does it fall under **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**? No, there’s no enumeration of possibilities here.

- Does it fall under **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**? No, the reason given ("he is so popular") does seem to support the proposition, even if weakly.

- Does it fall under **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**? Potentially, the basis "he is so popular" might not be a compelling causal reason, but let's look further.

- Does it fall under **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**? Yes, "Popular people are loved by everybody" essentially repeats the Proposition <P>, "Everybody loves Raymond," but reframed as the reason <R>. This repetition does not actually provide a new causal basis but restates the claim in a circular manner.

- Does it fall under **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**? No, it doesn’t assume universal agreement wrongly.

- Does it fall under **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**? No, the language isn’t ambiguous in a way that alters the sense of the argument.

### Conclusion
The argument "Everybody loves Raymond because he is so popular. Popular people are loved by everybody." falls under the defective argument type **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**. The supposed reason does no more than restate the proposition, offering no new justification or support.
