Sure, let's break down the task of classifying the defective argument string "A recent study found that there are plenty of scientists who disagree with the consensus position on this phenomenon." based on the definitions and steps you've provided.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition of the Task (IDAA)

1. **Identify what is being claimed (Proposition <P>) in the string:**
   - The string claims that "there are plenty of scientists who disagree with the consensus position on this phenomenon."

2. **Identify the underlying Reason (<R>):**
   - The underlying reason is implied by the notion that the existence of scientists who disagree casts doubt on the consensus position.

3. **Analyze if the Reason (<R>) is supported by a valid Proof of Reason (<PR>):**
   - The string cites "a recent study" as the proof that supports the reason.

4. **Evaluate if the Reason (<R>) and Proof of Reason (<PR>) are valid and compelling enough to establish the truth of the Proposition (<P>):**
   - Is the disagreement by plenty of scientists enough to disprove the consensus?
   - Is the study robust, comprehensive, or methodologically sound?

5. **Classify the type of defective argument found (IDA):**
   - Based on the definitions, we need to determine which type of defect is present.

### Analysis and Classification (IDA applied)

1. **Checking for Generalization (G):**
   - The claim about scientists disagreeing may or may not be generalizing from a subset to the whole scientific community.

2. **Checking for Incomplete Enumeration (FE):**
   - The string does not enumerate all relevant possibilities, but more specifically, it leans on a "recent study".

3. **Checking for Inconclusive Reason (IR):**
   - The reason provided (some scientists disagreeing) does not conclusively demonstrate the fallacy or weakness of the consensus position.

4. **Checking for Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):**
   - The causal basis is weak considering that scientific consensus is typically based on a wide body of evidence, not just the presence of dissenters.

5. **Checking for Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):**
   - This does not apply because the reason isnâ€™t merely restating the proposition.

6. **Checking for Presumptuous Consensus (FU):**
   - The string hints at disagreement within the scientific community, suggesting that the consensus is still in dispute without proving it is.

7. **Checking for Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):**
   - There is no explicit ambiguity in the language used.

### Conclusion
The defective argument in "A recent study found that there are plenty of scientists who disagree with the consensus position on this phenomenon." primarily falls under the type:

- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** The argument assumes its Proof of Reason (<PR>) as certain by suggesting the consensus is still in dispute without adequately challenging the established consensus.

Thus, the classification of the string <s> is of type **<FU>**.
