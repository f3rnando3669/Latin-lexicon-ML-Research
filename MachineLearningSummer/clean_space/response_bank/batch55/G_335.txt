For 
Certainly! Let's apply the decomposition of the classification task (<IDA>) to the given string step-by-step.

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
   - The statement is: "You shouldn't go to 'Vomito' I went once and the food was awful."
     - The central claim or assertion here is: "You shouldn't go to 'Vomito'."

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   - The reason provided to support the proposition is: "I went once and the food was awful."

3. **Evaluate the structure for defects:**
   - Now we'll classify the statement based on the predefined defective argument types.

4. **Classify as one of the defective types (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>):**
   - Generalization (<G>): This type involves drawing a conclusion based on a limited instance. Here, the speaker uses their single experience to generalize about the restaurant.
   - Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>): This is not applicable here since there is no attempt to enumerate possibilities.
   - Inconclusive Reason (<IR>): Not applicable, as the reason given directly supports the specific claim, although it might not be sufficient.
   - Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>): While the causal basis (the personal experience) is given, it could be seen as insufficient for making a broad generalization.
   - Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>): The reason given is not a repetition of the proposition.
   - Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>): There is no appeal to a universal agreement.
   - Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>): The language is clear and unambiguous.

Given these assessments, the most fitting classification would be:

- **Generalization (<G>)**: The speaker is generalizing that the restaurant 'Vomito' is bad based on their singular experience.

Thus, applying <IDAA> to the statement "You shouldn't go to 'Vomito' I went once and the food was awful" results in classifying it as type **<G> (Generalization)**.
