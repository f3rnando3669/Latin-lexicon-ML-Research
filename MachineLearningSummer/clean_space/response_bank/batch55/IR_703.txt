For 
To apply IDAA to the string "Argues that 'we've always done it that way.' In other words, because something worked in the past, it is the correct thing to do.", we need to follow a structured decomposition process. Hereâ€™s how the decomposition (D) would look for IDA tasks like IDAA:

1. **Identify and Extract the Proposition (P)**:
   Find the main claim or statement that is being put forth to be proved.

2. **Identify the Reason (R)**:
   Determine the causal basis or reasoning that is provided to support the Proposition (P).

3. **Examine for Defective Argument Types**:
   Check the argument for any signs of specific defective argument types: Generalization (G), Incomplete Enumeration (FE), Inconclusive Reason (IR), Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB), Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR), Presumptuous Consensus (FU), or Ambiguous Language Use (DEP).

4. **Classify the Argument**:
   Based on the examination, classify the argument into one of the identified defective argument types. 

Now, let's apply this to the example string:

### Step 1: Identify and Extract the Proposition (P)

The proposition (P) in the string is:
- "It is the correct thing to do."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (R)

The reason (R) given to support this proposition is:
- "We've always done it that way."
- "Because something worked in the past."

### Step 3: Examine for Defective Argument Types

Now, we need to examine if this reasoning fits any of the defective argument types:

- **Generalization (G)**: This is not a generalization based on part or majority applied to all.

- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: No enumeration of possibilities is claimed here.

- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The reason provided is that the action was done in the past. This does not conclusively demonstrate that it is correct to continue the action (relevance without necessity).

- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: The causal basis ("it worked in the past") is potentially weak because it does not account for changes over time that might impact the continued correctness of the action.

- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: The reason and the proposition are not identical. The reason "we've always done it that way" is different from the proposition "it is the correct thing to do."

- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: There is no mention of it being a consensus-based argument.

- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: The language does not appear to have multiple interpretations.

### Step 4: Classify the Argument

Based on the examination, the argument primarily fits into:
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The reason given does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness since it is based on a historical pattern rather than a logical or factual analysis of the current scenario.

- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: The causal argument that it worked in the past is not compelling enough to assert that it is correct now, without evaluating current conditions.

Thus, the string "Argues that 'we've always done it that way.' In other words, because something worked in the past, it is the correct thing to do." can be classified as both <IR> (Inconclusive Reason) and <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis).
