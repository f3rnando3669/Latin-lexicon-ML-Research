For 
To apply IDAA to the statement "I can tell this movie is going to be terrible; the opening credits aren't even over yet!", we first need to decompose the task into specific steps and then follow those steps to classify the argument. Here is the decomposition and step-by-step application:

### Decomposition of IDA (D) into Specific Steps
1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>)**: Determine what is being asserted or what the speaker intends to prove.
2. **Identify the Reason (<R>)**: Determine what is being used as the causal basis for the Proposition.
3. **Analyze the Reason (<R>)**: Evaluate whether the Reason provided sufficiently supports the Proposition.
4. **Classify the Defective Argument Type**: Compare the structure of the argument against the definitions of <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, and <DEP> to classify it.

### Application of Decomposition to the Given Argument

#### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)
The proposition is: "This movie is going to be terrible."

#### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)
The reason is: "The opening credits aren't even over yet."

#### Step 3: Analyze the Reason (<R>)
We need to assess whether the reason provided is a valid and sufficient basis to establish the truth of the proposition.

- The reason provided is not directly related to the quality of the movie. The state of the opening credits does not provide conclusive evidence regarding the overall quality of the film.

#### Step 4: Classify the Defective Argument Type
- **Generalization (<G>)**: The proposition does not generalize from a partial sample.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: The proposition is not claiming a complete enumeration of possibilities.
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The reason does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: The reason is not simply a repetition of the proposition.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The causal basis for the proposition is not compelling.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: The argument does not assume a consensus as a proof.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**: The proposition is not ambiguous or taken in another sense.

Given this analysis, the argument fits most closely with:
- <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis): The reason "The opening credits aren't even over yet" is not a compelling causal basis to establish that "the movie is going to be terrible."

Therefore, the classification of the argument is **<WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis)**.

### Conclusion
By decomposing the task of classifying the argument step by step, we have identified that the statement "I can tell this movie is going to be terrible; the opening credits aren't even over yet!" is an example of a defective argument type <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis).
