For 
To apply <IDAA> to the classification of the string "It rained and then we lost the game. Every time it rains, we're going to lose," we need to follow the steps to decompose the task and classify the given string into one of the defective argument types.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition and Application:

#### Step 1: Decompose <IDA> into specific steps:
1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>)**: Determine what is being asserted or claimed.
2. **Identify the Reason (<R>)**: Determine the causal basis provided for the Proposition.
3. **Identify any Proof of Reason (<PR>)**: Determine if there is any additional argument that corroborates the Reason.
4. **Analyze the relationship between <P>, <R>, and <PR>**: Evaluate if the reasoning is sound or defective based on the definitions of defective argument types.
5. **Compare with defective argument types**: Check the identified components against the definitions of defective arguments (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>).

#### Step 2: Apply these steps to the specific string:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>)**:
   - Proposition: "Every time it rains, we're going to lose."

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>)**:
   - Reason: Implicitly, the reason seems to be "It rained and then we lost the game," implying a causal connection between rain and losing the game.

3. **Identify any Proof of Reason (<PR>)**:
   - Proof of Reason: There is no additional argument presented to support the Reason.

4. **Analyze the relationship between <P>, <R>, and <PR>**:
   - The Proposition claims a general rule ("Every time it rains, we're going to lose").
   - The Reason provided is a single instance ("It rained and then we lost the game").

5. **Compare with defective argument types**:
   - **Generalization (<G>)**: This defect occurs when a proposition is based on one instance or a majority but not necessarily applicable to all. In this case, the proposition "Every time it rains, we're going to lose" is based on only one instance: "It rained and then we lost the game."
   - There is no indication of Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>), Inconclusive Reason (<IR>), Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>), Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>), Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>), or Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>) from the given string.

#### Step 3: Final Classification:
Based on the identified Proposition and Reason, and the comparison with defective argument types, the string "It rained and then we lost the game. Every time it rains, we're going to lose." is classified as type <G> (Generalization).

### Conclusion:
Applying <IDAA> to the string resulted in the classification of the argument as a Generalization (<G>). This conclusion is reached by decomposing the task, systematically evaluating the components and relationships in the argument, and comparing these components with the defective argument types definitions.
