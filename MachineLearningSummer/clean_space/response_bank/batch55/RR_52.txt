For 
To apply <IDAA> (the decomposition of the task of classifying a string into steps) to the given string "Senator Randall isn't lying when she says she cares about her constituents—she wouldn't lie to people she cares about.", we'll break down the task of identifying the type of defective argument in a systematic way.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition and Application

#### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (P)
Determine what is set forth summarily as the main claim or proposition.

- **Proposition (P)**: "Senator Randall isn't lying when she says she cares about her constituents."

#### Step 2: Identify the Reason (R)
Determine the causal or justification basis that is provided to establish the truth of the Proposition.

- **Reason (R)**: "She wouldn't lie to people she cares about."

#### Step 3: Check for Proof of Reason (PR)
Determine if there is additional data or argumentation that supports the Reason.

- **Proof of Reason (PR)**: No additional argumentation provided other than the Reason itself.

#### Step 4: Evaluate for Defective Argument Types
Evaluate the strings and their relationship to see if they fit into any defective argument type:

- Is it a Generalization (<G>)? The string does not involve a generalization from parts to the whole.
  
- Is it Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)? The argument does not claim to have enumerated all possibilities.

- Is it Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)? The Reason given does not conclusively prove the Proposition. The Reason mentioned is more of an assertion without solid evidence.

- Is it Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)? The Reason provided is weak because it does not present a compelling causal basis for the Proposition. The link between caring about constituents and not lying is assumed but not substantiated.

- Is it Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)? The Reason ("She wouldn't lie to people she cares about") essentially restates the Proposition in other words without adding substantive evidence.

- Is it Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)? The argument does not involve an assumed consensus.

- Is it Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)? The language used does not seem particularly ambiguous, but rather straightforwardly circular.

#### Step 5: Classify the Argument
Based on steps 1-4, determine the most fitting defective argument type.

Given the analysis:
- The Reason provided is just a restatement of the Proposition without providing any new evidence or causal foundation.
- It fits the pattern of <RR>: Faulty Repetition of Proposition.

### Conclusion
The string "Senator Randall isn't lying when she says she cares about her constituents—she wouldn't lie to people she cares about." is best classified under the defective argument type <RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition).
