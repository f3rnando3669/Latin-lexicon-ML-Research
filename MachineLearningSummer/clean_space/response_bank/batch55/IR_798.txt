For 
To apply IDAA to the given string "A mother who tells the pediatrician that she doesn't trust his judgment because he's never been a mother," we need to first decompose the task of classifying this string into individual steps, then execute those steps systematically. Let's break it down:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition:

1. **Identify the Proposition (P)**: Determine what is being asserted or intended to be proven.
2. **Identify the Reason (R)**: Ascertain the causal basis or rationale provided for the proposition.
3. **Classify the Reason as Defective or Not**: Compare the reason against the types of defective arguments to see if it fits any category.
4. **Select the Appropriate Defective Argument Type (if applicable)**: Based on the classification in step 3, identify the type of defective argument.

### Detailed Steps and Execution:

1. **Identify the Proposition (P)**:
   - The proposition in this context is: "I (the mother) don't trust the pediatrician's judgment."

2. **Identify the Reason (R)**:
   - The reason provided for this lack of trust is: "because he's never been a mother."

3. **Classify the Reason as Defective or Not**:
   - Examine the reason to see if it fits any of the predefined defective argument types:
     - **Generalization (G)**: Not applicable here as this isn't a broad assertion based on a limited set of observations.
     - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: Not applicable because there's no enumeration of possibilities.
     - **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: This might be fitting, as the R does not necessarily support the P conclusively. Just because the pediatrician hasn't been a mother doesn't necessarily invalidate his professional judgment.
     - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: This also seems applicable, as the R (not being a mother) is not a compelling reason to distrust his professional judgment.
     - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: Not applicable here.
     - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: Not applicable as no universal agreement is referenced.
     - **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: Not applicable as the language itself is not ambiguous.

4. **Select the Appropriate Defective Argument Type (if applicable)**:
   - Based on the classification, both **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** and **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)** seem relevant. However, **WCB** seems more precise because it focuses on the weakness of the causal connection presented.

### Conclusion:

The string "A mother who tells the pediatrician that she doesn't trust his judgment because he's never been a mother" can be classified as an argument of type **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**. This is because the reason provided (the pediatrician never having been a mother) does not provide a compelling basis to distrust his professional judgment.
