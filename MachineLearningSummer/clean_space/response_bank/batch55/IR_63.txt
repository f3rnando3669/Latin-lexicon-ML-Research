To apply the process of IDAA (the application of decomposed steps to classify the type of a defective argument) to the given string, we will follow specific steps to decompose the task.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition of IDA:

1. **Identify the Proposition (P)**: Determine the main assertion being made.
2. **Identify the Reason (R)**: Find the causal basis or justification provided in support of P.
3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (PR)**: Look for any additional evidence or arguments that support the Reason.
4. **Evaluate the Argument**: Classify the argument according to the defined defective argument types.

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (P)

The proposition is the main assertion being made in the argument.

**Proposition (P):** "We need more revenue to support the programs that we have."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (R)

The reason sets forth the causal basis for the Proposition.

**Reason (R):** "Children are our future."

### Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason (PR)

Look for additional arguments that support the Reason.

**Proof of Reason (PR):** "Let's support children."

### Step 4: Evaluate the Argument

Now, we need to classify the argument according to the defective argument types:

- **Generalization (G):** Not applicable here, as the argument is not about applying an assertion to a broader group based on a sample.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** Not applicable, as the argument is not about an incomplete list of possibilities.
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** The Reason provided ("Children are our future") is not clearly linked to the Proposition in a logical manner that conclusively supports it.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** The Reason does not provide a compelling causal basis for needing more revenue. The link between supporting children and needing more revenue is weak.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** The Reason is not merely repeating the Proposition.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** The Proof of Reason ("Let's support children") does not rely on an assumed universal agreement.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** The argument does not hinge on language that can be taken in another sense than intended by the speaker.

**Classification:** The argument seems to fit the type of Inconclusive Reason (IR) as the Reason provided does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the Proposition. It also exhibits traits of Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB) because the Reason given is not a compelling one for the need for more revenue.

### Conclusion: 
The given argument, "We need more revenue to support the programs that we have. Children are our future. Let's support children," can be classified as primarily an Inconclusive Reason (IR), with some characteristics of Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB).
