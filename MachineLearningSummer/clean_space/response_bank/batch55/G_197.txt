For 
To apply IDAA to the statement "Look at people like Michael Vick and OJ Simpson. Professional athletes really have no sense of morality," we need to decompose the task of classifying this statement into specific steps (D). Here is the decomposition and the detailed application to the argument:

### Decomposition of the Task (D):
1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>)**: Determine the main assertion being made.
2. **Identify the Reason (<R>)**: Find the causal basis presented for the proposition.
3. **Analyze for Defective Argument Types**:
    - Check for <G>: Generalization
    - Check for <FE>: Incomplete Enumeration
    - Check for <IR>: Inconclusive Reason
    - Check for <RR>: Faulty Repetition of Proposition
    - Check for <WCB>: Insufficient Causal Basis
    - Check for <FU>: Presumptuous Consensus
    - Check for <DEP>: Ambiguous Language Use

### Application of the Decomposition (IDAA) to the Argument:
1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>)**:
   - **<P>**: "Professional athletes really have no sense of morality."

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>)**:
   - **<R>**: "Look at people like Michael Vick and OJ Simpson."

3. **Analyze for Defective Argument Types**:
   - **Check for <G>: Generalization**:
     - The proposition asserts that all professional athletes lack a sense of morality based on the actions of a few individuals (Michael Vick and OJ Simpson). This is a classic example of overgeneralization.
     - **Defective Argument Type Identified**: **<G>**
   
   - **Check for <FE>: Incomplete Enumeration**:
     - The argument does not attempt to list all professional athletes or all instances where professional athletes' morality could be evaluated. It only mentions two individuals. This does not necessarily make it an incomplete enumeration unless the argument claims to cover all possibilities explicitly, which it does not.
     - **Defective Argument Type Not Identified**.

   - **Check for <IR>: Inconclusive Reason**:
     - The reason given does not conclusively establish that all professional athletes lack morality. It only provides examples of two individuals, which is insufficient to cover the entire group of professional athletes.
     - **Defective Argument Type Identified**: **<IR>**

   - **Check for <RR>: Faulty Repetition of Proposition**:
     - The reason ("Look at people like Michael Vick and OJ Simpson") does not merely repeat the proposition ("Professional athletes really have no sense of morality"). It's intended to provide examples rather than restate the proposition.
     - **Defective Argument Type Not Identified**.

   - **Check for <WCB>: Insufficient Causal Basis**:
     - The causal basis—two examples—is weak for making such a broad claim about all professional athletes.
     - **Defective Argument Type Identified**: **<WCB**

   - **Check for <FU>: Presumptuous Consensus**:
     - There is no claim that the proposition is universally agreed upon or relies on a presumed consensus.
     - **Defective Argument Type Not Identified**.

   - **Check for <DEP>: Ambiguous Language Use**:
     - The terms used in the reason and the proposition are clear and specific to the examples given, so ambiguity does not appear to be an issue.
     - **Defective Argument Type Not Identified**.

### Summary of Defective Argument Types Identified:
- **<G>: Generalization**
- **<IR>: Inconclusive Reason**
- **<WCB>: Insufficient Causal Basis**

By following the decomposition steps (D), we classified the statement as exhibiting Generalization (<G>), Inconclusive Reason (<IR>), and Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>).
