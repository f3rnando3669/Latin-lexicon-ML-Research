Sure, let's apply the process of decomposing the task of classifying the given argument into its specific types step by step.

Step-by-Step Application of IDAA:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (P)
The proposition (P) is the statement that we aim to prove or establish.

**Proposition (P):** "Annie Smith is the best-liked CEO in our company's history."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (R)
The reason (R) sets forth the causal basis for (P), establishing the truth of what we are urging.

**Reason (R):** "Thanks to her enduring popularity with employees."

### Step 3: Determine the Proof of Reason (PR)
The proof of reason (PR) corroborates (R) by means of additional arguments.

In the given statement, there isn't an explicit Proof of Reason (PR). It’s just stated that she’s popular, without additional supporting evidence.

### Step 4: Classify the Defective Argument
Now we classify the argument based on the given defective types:

- **Generalization (G):** The proposition is based on a part or majority but not necessarily applicable to all.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** Claims a complete enumeration of possibilities but misses some.
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** The reason does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** The reason is not a compelling causal basis for the proposition.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** When the reason repeats what was stated in the proposition.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** Assumes the proof of reason as certain because it is “universally agreed upon.”
- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** The proof of reason can be taken in another sense than intended.

### Step 5: Apply Classification Criteria to the Argument
Let's apply the criteria to the given argument:

**Argument:** "Thanks to her enduring popularity with employees, Annie Smith is the best-liked CEO in our company's history."

1. **Generalization (G):** There is no evidence provided that generalizes from a part to a whole improperly.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** The argument doesn't claim a complete enumeration of possibilities.
3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** The reason ("Thanks to her enduring popularity with employees") does not conclusively demonstrate that she is the best-liked CEO. Popularity does not automatically infer she is the best-liked without further supporting evidence.
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** The reason provided is weak as it doesn't strongly support the proposition. Popularity with employees may contribute but does not conclusively establish her as the best-liked.
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** The reason is not a repetition of the proposition.
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** There is no reference to a universal agreement or consensus.
7. **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** There is no ambiguous language use present.

### Step 6: Conclusion and Classification
Having gone through each of the defective argument types, the given argument most closely matches:

**Inconclusive Reason (IR):** The reason provided does not conclusively establish the correctness of the proposition. The proposition "Annie Smith is the best-liked CEO in our company's history" is not conclusively proven solely by the reason "Thanks to her enduring popularity with employees."

Thus, the argument can be classified as an Inconclusive Reason (IR).
