For 
To apply <IDAA> to "This trick, which literally means "to the guy," distorts a person's character subtly or blatantly, undermining their reputation regardless of how compelling their point is," we will follow these steps:

1. **Identify Proposition (<P>):** Determine what is being asserted or intended to be proven.
2. **Identify Reason (<R>):** Isolate the causal basis asserted to support the Proposition.
3. **Evaluate the Proof of Reason (<PR>):** Check additional arguments or evidence supporting the Reason.
4. **Classify Defective Argument Types:** Based on the definitions of defective argument types, identify which, if any, type the statement falls under.

### Step 1: Identify Proposition (<P>)
The Proposition in the given string is:
"This trick... distorts a person's character subtly or blatantly, undermining their reputation regardless of how compelling their point is."

### Step 2: Identify Reason (<R>)
The Reason provided for this Proposition is:
"which literally means 'to the guy'"

### Step 3: Evaluate the Proof of Reason (<PR>)
In the current string, there is no explicit Proof of Reason provided.

### Step 4: Classify the Defective Argument Type
- **Generalization (<G>):** This does not appear to be a generalization of an individual experience applied universally.
  
- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** There is no enumeration of possibilities presented.
  
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** The reason provided ("which literally means 'to the guy'") does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition that the trick distorts character and undermines reputation. The causal link between the phrase and its alleged effects is weakly established.

- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** The causal basis provided ("which literally means 'to the guy'") is not compelling enough to convincingly establish that this trick distorts a personâ€™s character and undermines their reputation. 

- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** The Reason does not repeat the Proposition.

- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** There is no invocation of presumptive consensus or universal agreement here.
  
- **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):** The phrase "which literally means 'to the guy'" could be seen as ambiguous, but it doesn't clearly affect the Proof of Reason aspect as there is no additional argument used.

### Conclusion
The argument type of the string "This trick, which literally means 'to the guy,' distorts a person's character subtly or blatantly, undermining their reputation regardless of how compelling their point is," can be classified as <IR> (Inconclusive Reason) and <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis). The Reason provided does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the Proposition, and the causal basis asserted is not compelling.
