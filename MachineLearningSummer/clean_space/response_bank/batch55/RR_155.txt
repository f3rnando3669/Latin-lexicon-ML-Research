To apply the IDAA (decomposition of the task IDA into specific steps) to the given string "Flippityflu: smarter than a Floppityflip. Floppityflip: dumber than a Flippityflu.", we follow these steps:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
   - Proposition Statements: 
     - "Flippityflu: smarter than a Floppityflip."
     - "Floppityflip: dumber than a Flippityflu."

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   - The reason provided in each case seems to be rooted in a comparative assertion:
     - Reason 1: "smarter than a Floppityflip" for the first proposition.
     - Reason 2: "dumber than a Flippityflu" for the second proposition.

3. **Check Proof of Reason (<PR>):**
   - The proof or support for the reasoning isn't provided in this context. It's just an assertion of each component's quality.

4. **Assess for Defective Argument Types:**
   - **Generalization (<G>):**
     - This doesn't apply here as we aren't generalizing from one or a few instances to all instances.
   
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):**
     - This doesn't apply, as there is no enumeration of possibilities.

   - **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):**
     - The reasons given "smarter than" and "dumber than" are reciprocal but fail to provide any concrete evidence or demonstration of truth. It assumes knowledge without offering proof.

   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):**
     - The causal basis here (comparative assertions) is not compelling without context. Simply stating one entity is smarter or dumber than the other isn't sufficient.

   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):**
     - This is close, as each statement is essentially a rephrasing of the other.

   - **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):**
     - Consensus isn't assumed here.

   - **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):**
     - The language "smarter" and "dumber" could have ambiguous interpretations without context but isn't the main issue here.

5. **Determine the most appropriate defective argument type:**
   - The strongest case here for a defective argument type is **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)** because both statements are essentially saying the same thing in a reciprocal manner.

Therefore, the classification of the given string "Flippityflu: smarter than a Floppityflip. Floppityflip: dumber than a Flippityflu." is **<RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition)**.
