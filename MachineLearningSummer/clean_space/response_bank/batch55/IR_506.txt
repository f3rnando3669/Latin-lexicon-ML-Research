For 
To apply the process of IDAA (which involves decomposing and classifying the argument into the specific types of defective arguments), let's break down the process systematically:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)
The Proposition (<P>) in the given argument is:
"Having come from the same political party, he is sure to communicate biased and untrue claims about his party-mates."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)
The Reason (<R>) given is:
"Having come from the same political party"

### Step 3: Evaluate the Causal Relationship
We need to assess if the reason provided has a compelling causal basis for the proposition.

### Step 4: Classify the Defective Argument
We will now categorize the argument into one of the types <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>:

#### Defective Argument Types Analysis:

- **<G> (Generalization)**: This would occur if the argument applies a trait found in some individuals to all individuals. In this case, the proposition claims that someone from the same political party will necessarily communicate biased and untrue claims. This can be seen as a generalization of behavior based on party affiliation without considering individual differences.
  
- **<FE> (Incomplete Enumeration)**: This occurs when the argument claims to have considered all possibilities but misses some pertinent ones. This argument does not suggest that all possibilities are considered or excluded.

- **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason)**: Here, the reason does not conclusively demonstrate the proposition. The causal link between being from the same political party and communicating biased and untrue claims is tenuous and not conclusively demonstrated.

- **<WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis)**: This applies if the causal basis provided is not compelling. The reason given ("Having come from the same political party") is indeed insufficient to firmly establish that the person will make biased and untrue claims.

- **<RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition)**: This would apply if the reason repeats the proposition in different terms. The argument doesn't merely restate the proposition.

- **<FU> (Presumptuous Consensus)**: A consensus argument would claim a universally agreed-upon truth that is still in dispute. This type does not apply here.

- **<DEP> (Ambiguous Language Use)**: This involves using language that can be taken in another sense than intended. The language in question does not demonstrate this ambiguity.

### Conclusion:
Upon analysis, the given argument involves a combination of issues but the principal classification falls under two types:
1. **<G> Generalization**: The assumption that all individuals from the same political party make biased, untrue claims.
2. **<WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis**: The causal link is weak and not compelling to substantiate the proposition.

Thus, the argument in question can primarily be classified as **<WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis** (as the reason provided does not compellingly establish the truth of the proposition).

Therefore, after applying **IDAA**:
The argument "Having come from the same political party, he is sure to communicate biased and untrue claims about his party-mates" is primarily of type **<WCB>**.
