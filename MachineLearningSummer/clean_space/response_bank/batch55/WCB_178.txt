For 
To apply \( \text{IDAA} \) to the string "I failed Pre-Cal because my teacher doesn’t like me," we need to decompose the task \( \text{IDA} \) (classifying the argument as one of the defective argument types) into specific steps. Here's how we can break it down:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (\( \text{D} \)) for \( \text{IDA} \):

1. **Identify the Proposition \( <P> \) and Reason \( <R> \):**
   - **Proposition \( <P> \)**: "I failed Pre-Cal."
   - **Reason \( <R> \)**: "because my teacher doesn’t like me."

2. **Classify the argument type based on definitions:**
   - **Examine for Generalization \( <G> \)**: Is the failure attributed to a general condition based on specific instances?
   - **Examine for Incomplete Enumeration \( <FE> \)**: Is the proposition claiming all possibilities are considered for failure while missing some?
   - **Examine for Inconclusive Reason \( <IR> \)**: Does the reason conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition?
   - **Examine for Insufficient Causal Basis \( <WCB> \)**: Is the reason weakly linked causally to the proposition?
   - **Examine for Faulty Repetition of Proposition \( <RR> \)**: Does the reason just restate the proposition without providing new information?
   - **Examine for Presumptuous Consensus \( <FU> \)**: Is the proof of reason based on assumed universal agreement?
   - **Examine for Ambiguous Language Use \( <DEP> \)**: Can the reason be taken in another sense than the speaker intended?

### Applying the Decomposition (\( \text{IDAA} \)):

1. **Identify the Proposition \( <P> \) and Reason \( <R> \):**
   - **Proposition \( <P> \)**: "I failed Pre-Cal."
   - **Reason \( <R> \)**: "because my teacher doesn’t like me."

2. **Classify the argument type:**
   - **Generalization \( <G> \)**: This doesn’t seem to fit as there’s no broad generalization based on specific instances.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration \( <FE> \)**: There isn’t an attempt to enumerate all possible reasons for failure, so this doesn’t fit.
   - **Inconclusive Reason \( <IR> \)**: The reason given ("my teacher doesn’t like me") doesn’t conclusively demonstrate why the person failed Pre-Cal. Other factors like understanding of material, exam performance, etc., are not addressed.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis \( <WCB> \)**: The causal link between "teacher doesn’t like me" and "failed Pre-Cal" is weak and not compelling. It may be a factor, but it’s not convincingly demonstrated to be the sole cause.
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition \( <RR> \)**: The reason does not restate the proposition; it is a new claim, though weakly linked.
   - **Presumptuous Consensus \( <FU> \)**: There is no indication that the reason is based on assumed unanimous agreement.
   - **Ambiguous Language Use \( <DEP> \)**: The language used is relatively straightforward and doesn’t seem open to alternative interpretations.

Through this analysis, we observe that the argument can primarily be classified under:
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (\( <WCB> \))** because the reason given ("my teacher doesn’t like me") is weak in establishing a compelling causal link to the proposition ("I failed Pre-Cal").

Therefore, the defective argument type for the string "I failed Pre-Cal because my teacher doesn’t like me" is **Insufficient Causal Basis \( <WCB> \)**.
