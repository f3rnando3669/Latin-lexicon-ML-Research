For 
To apply <IDAA> (the application of decomposition) to the task of classifying the given string as a defective argument type, we'll break it down step by step.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition of <IDA> Task

1. **Identify the Proposition (P):**
   - Determine the primary claim or proposition set forth in the argument.
   
2. **Identify the Reason (R):**
   - Extract the causal basis or reasoning provided to support the proposition.
   
3. **Identify the Prove of Reason (PR):**
   - Look for any additional arguments or proof provided to corroborate the reasoning.
   
4. **Evaluate Each Identified Component:**
   - Determine if each identified component (P, R, PR) aligns with the definitions provided.
   
5. **Classify the Argument:**
   - Based on the evaluation, classify the argument into one of the defective types (G, FE, IR, WCB, RR, FU, DEP).

### Applying the Steps to the Given String

Let's break down and analyze the string: "You want me to clean my locker? I think I left my homework in Science class. I need to keep up with my homework to get good grades."

#### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (P)
- **Proposition (P):** The initial claim seems to be "You want me to clean my locker?"

#### Step 2: Identify the Reason (R)
- **Reason (R):** "I think I left my homework in Science class." This provides a causal basis for not addressing the proposition directly.

#### Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason (PR)
- **Proof of Reason (PR):** "I need to keep up with my homework to get good grades." This additional argument backs up the reason, implying that prioritizing homework over cleaning the locker is necessary for good grades.

#### Step 4: Evaluate Each Identified Component
- **Proposition (P):** "You want me to clean my locker?"
  - Clear and straightforward.
  
- **Reason (R):** "I think I left my homework in Science class."
  - Causes a diversion to another issue (homework), rather than addressing cleaning the locker.
  
- **Proof of Reason (PR):** "I need to keep up with my homework to get good grades."
  - Supports why finding the homework (implied by going to Science class) is important.

#### Step 5: Classify the Argument
1. **Generalization (G):** Not applicable here, as the statements are specific rather than generalized.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** Not applicable, there's no enumeration of possibilities.
3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** Possible, Reason (R) does not conclusively establish why cleaning the locker cannot be done.
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** Possible, the cause provided (homework in Science class) is not compelling enough to justify not cleaning the locker.
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** Not applicable; Reason (R) and Proposition (P) are different.
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** Not applicable, there's no appeal to universal agreement.
7. **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** Not applicable, the argument's language isn’t ambiguous.

### Conclusion
The argument is primarily defected by an **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** and **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**:
- **IR:** The reason given ("left my homework in Science class") does not conclusively demonstrate why the locker can't be cleaned.
- **WCB:** The causal basis (focusing on homework) isn’t compelling enough to justify not cleaning the locker at that moment.

Therefore, the string can be classified primarily as an instance of **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** and secondarily as **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**.
