For 
To apply <IDAA> to the task of classifying the string "This legislation is sinful because it is the wrong thing to do," we need to systematically decompose the task of identifying the defective argument type and then proceed step by step to classify the given string. Here is the step-by-step decomposition and application:

### Decomposition of <t> (Task Identification and Classification) into Specific Steps <D>

1. **Identify the components of the argument**:
    - Proposition (<P>)
    - Reason (<R>)

2. **Determine the nature of the argument parts**:
    - Assess if the Reason <R> supports the Proposition <P> adequately.

3. **Match the identified argument to the definitions of defective argument types <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>**:
    - Evaluate if the argument falls into one of these categories based on its structure and the nature of the support given.

### Application of <D> to <IDA> for the given string: "This legislation is sinful because it is the wrong thing to do."

**Step 1: Identify the components of the argument**
- Proposition (<P>): "This legislation is sinful."
- Reason (<R>): "because it is the wrong thing to do."

**Step 2: Determine the nature of the argument parts**
- The Reason <R> ("because it is the wrong thing to do") is meant to corroborate the Proposition <P> ("This legislation is sinful"). 

**Step 3: Match the identified argument to the definitions of defective argument types**
- Evaluate if the Reason <R> ("because it is the wrong thing to do") provides a substantial, distinct causal basis for the Proposition <P>. 

When examining the argument, we note that the Reason simply restates the Proposition in another form without providing additional, clarifying information or support. The Reason does not give a separate causal basis but merely rephrases the Proposition.

### Conclusion:
The defective argument type here is:
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: The Reason appears to be presented as supporting the Proposition but says precisely the same thing as the Proposition. "It is the wrong thing to do" does not add new information to explain why "the legislation is sinful."

Thus, the string "This legislation is sinful because it is the wrong thing to do" is classified as <RR>, a Faulty Repetition of Proposition.
