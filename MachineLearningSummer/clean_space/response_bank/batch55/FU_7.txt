To apply IDAA (the decomposition of the task of classifying strings as defective arguments) to the given example, we need to systematically decompose the task (t) of classifying the string (s) into specific steps. Let's follow this process step by step.

**Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>) and Reason (<R>) in the Argument**
- Proposition (<P>): "You should run right out and purchase the newest iPhone 22."
- Reason (<R>): "Because you will literally be the only one who doesn't own one!"

**Step 2: Analyze the Reason (<R>) for any Defects**
- The reason suggests that the causal basis for purchasing the iPhone 22 is the implication that everyone else already owns it.

**Step 3: Classify the Type of Defective Argument**
- <P> is urging the necessity to purchase the iPhone.
- <R> is based on a claim of universal ownership.

Now let's review the defective arguments as defined and see which one fits this structure:

- **<G> Generalization**: It does not apply here, as the argument isn't making a broad generalization from a sample to the whole.
- **<FE> Incomplete Enumeration**: This is not making claim based on a partial list of possibilities.
- **<IR> Inconclusive Reason**: This doesn’t apply here, as the reason isn't about being inconclusive but rather it’s specific.
- **<WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis**: This could partially apply because the causal basis (everyone owns one) is weak and likely untrue, but not exactly the type of weakness focused on in this case.
- **<RR> Faulty Repetition of Proposition**: This is not simply repeating the proposition in the reasoning.
- **<FU> Presumptuous Consensus**: This seems very likely. The reason assumes universal acceptance (“you will literally be the only one who doesn’t own one”).
- **<DEP> Ambiguous Language Use**: There's no ambiguity in the language here.

Since the argument’s reason is based on the assumption of universal acceptance which is a thing still in dispute, the classification would likely be:

**<FU> Presumptuous Consensus**

**Conclusion:**
After applying IDAA, the classification of the given string is that it exemplifies the defective argument type **<FU> Presumptuous Consensus**.
