To apply the decomposition of the task of classifying the given string into specific steps (IDAA) to the statement provided, we need to break it down systematically and determine which defective argument type it falls under. Here is the step-by-step breakdown:

### Step 1: Understand the Statement
First, we need to understand the statement given:
"To justify support for a position by citing an esteemed or well-known figure who supports it."
"Para justificar el apoyo a una posici√≥n citando a una figura estimada o conocida que lo apoya."

### Step 2: Identify Key Components
Identify the components and key ideas in the statement:
- "Justify support for a position"
- "By citing an esteemed or well-known figure"

### Step 3: Compare Each Key Component Against Defective Argument Types
We need to compare the nature of the argument described with the defined defective argument types:

- **Generalization (G)**: Does the statement represent an assertion based on a part or majority but not applicable to all? No, it cites a figure, not a part.
  
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: Does the statement miss out on some pertinent possibilities when claiming completeness? No, it's not about enumerating possibilities.

- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: Does the reason provided fail to conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition? No, although the reason is an authority figure, the incompleteness isn't the issue.

- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: Is the causal basis for the justification not compelling? Maybe, since citing an authority might be seen as insufficient.

- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: Is the reason just repeating the proposition? No, it presents a figure as a reason.

- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: Is the proof assumed as certain because it is "universally agreed upon"? Partial resemblance, yet primarily about citing an authoritative figure.

- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: Can the proof be taken in another sense than intended? No, the language isn't ambiguous.

### Step 4: Determine the Most Suitable Defective Argument Type
Consider which defective argument type fits best.

The statement suggests that the justification relies on the authority or esteem of a well-known figure. The problem is that the validity of the support isn't necessarily based on solid reasoning but on the presumed authority of the person cited.

This most closely aligns with the concept of **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**, as the authority alone does not necessarily constitute a convincing reason for the position. However, it also has elements of **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)** because the causal basis for support (the figure's esteem) isn't inherently adequate.

### Step 5: Make a Classification Decision
After evaluating, we classify the given string as predominantly an example of:
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: since the reliance on an esteemed figure does not completely and conclusively justify the support for the position.

Thus, the classification of the statement "To justify support for a position by citing an esteemed or well-known figure who supports it." is **<IR>**.
