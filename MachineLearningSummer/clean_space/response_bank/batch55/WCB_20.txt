For 
To apply <IDAA> (the task of decomposing and applying the classification of defective arguments) to the given string "assumes that short-term deviations will correct themselves," we will break down the process into specific steps to classify the defective argument type. Here is the step-by-step process:

### Step 1: Understand the String <s>
Interpret the meaning of the string "assumes that short-term deviations will correct themselves."

This phrase makes an assumption that any deviations from the norm or expected behavior in the short term will automatically rectify without external intervention or influence.

### Step 2: Identify the Structure of the Argument
Determine if the string represents a Proposition <P>, a Reason <R>, or a Proof of Reason <PR> in the context of an argument.

In this case, the string can be identified as a Reason <R>, as it provides a causal explanation or assumption related to some underlying Proposition <P>.

### Step 3: Analyze the Argument for Defectiveness
Using the definitions provided for defective argument types, match the characteristics of the string to see if it fits one of the classifications <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <WCB>, <RR>, <FU>, or <DEP>.

- **<G> Generalization**: Not applicable, as the statement is not making an overgeneralization from some part or a majority to all cases.
- **<FE> Incomplete Enumeration**: Not applicable, as the statement is not claiming to make a complete enumeration of possibilities.
- **<IR> Inconclusive Reason**: Possibly applicable. The statement assumes that short-term deviations will correct themselves without providing conclusive evidence to support this assumption.
- **<WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis**: Highly applicable. The statement presents a causal basis (self-correction) for the assumption, but does not provide a compelling or sufficient reason to support that short-term deviations will indeed correct themselves.
- **<RR> Faulty Repetition of Proposition**: Not applicable, as the reason given does not merely repeat the proposition.
- **<FU> Presumptuous Consensus**: Not applicable, as the statement does not rely on a presumption that it is universally agreed upon.
- **<DEP> Ambiguous Language Use**: Not applicable, as the language in the statement does not seem ambiguous in its intended meaning.

### Step 4: Determine the Best Fit for Defect Type
Evaluate which defective argument type best describes the string. Given the information:

- The Reason <R> provided ("assumes that short-term deviations will correct themselves") lacks sufficient support or evidence, which aligns most closely with the defective argument type <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis).

### Step 5: Classify the Argument
Classify the string as of type <WCB> based on the analysis.

### Conclusion
The string "assumes that short-term deviations will correct themselves" is classified as a defective argument type <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis).

This completes the application of <IDAA> to the given string.
