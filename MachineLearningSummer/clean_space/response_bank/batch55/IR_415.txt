For 
To apply the advanced task of decomposition (D) to the task of classifying the argument as a type of defective argument (IDA), we will follow these steps:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>)**: Determine the main assertion that is being set forth to be proved.
2. **Identify the Reason (<R>)**: Determine the causal basis offered for the Proposition.
3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>)**: Look for the arguments that are used to support the Reason.
4. **Analyze the Argument for Defects**: Check each part of the argument and identify any potential defects, referencing the definitions of the defective argument types.
5. **Classify the Defective Argument**: Based on the analysis, classify the argument into one of the defective argument types.

Let’s analyze the argument step-by-step:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)
- **Proposition (<P>)**: "Modern biology doesn’t support intelligent design."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)
- **Reason (<R>)**: "Dembski would say that because he’s religious."

### Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>)**
- **Proof of Reason (<PR>)**: This step is not explicitly covered in the provided argument, but let’s proceed to the next steps without assuming <PR>.

### Step 4: Analyze the Argument for Defects
- **Assertion**: Let’s break down the components:
  1. **Premise (1)**: William Dembski argues that modern biology supports the idea that there is an intelligent designer who created life.
  2. **Premise (2)**: Dembski would say that because he’s religious.
  3. **Conclusion**: Modern biology doesn’t support intelligent design.

- **Analysis**:
  - **(G)**: Generalization—Premise (2) doesn’t seem to assert something generalized to all individuals but rather refers to a specific individual’s motivation.
  - **(FE)**: Incomplete Enumeration—The argument doesn’t claim to have listed all possibilities.
  - **(IR)**: Inconclusive Reason—This looks promising. Premise (2) questions the reliability of Dembski’s argument based on his religious bias, not necessarily addressing the scientific evidence in modern biology.
  - **(RR)**: Faulty Repetition of Proposition—The reason isn’t a repetition of the proposition.
  - **(WCB)**: Insufficient Causal Basis—The causal basis provided is not strong; the reason offered is more of an ad hominem attack than a causal connection.
  - **(FU)**: Presumptuous Consensus—The argument doesn’t seem to rely on assumed universal agreement.
  - **(DEP)**: Ambiguous Language Use—The language does not seem ambiguous in a way that affects the argument.

### Step 5: Classify the Defective Argument
- The argument likely falls under **(IR) - Inconclusive Reason**. The reason given, that Dembski is religious, doesn’t substantiate the claim about the scientific support for or against intelligent design. It fails to address the actual evidence and scientific basis but rather suggests a bias in Dembski’s argument without proving the main proposition.

### Conclusion
The argument "(1) William Dembski argues that modern biology supports the idea that there is an intelligent designer who created life.
(2) Dembski would say that because he’s religious.
Therefore:
(3) Modern biology doesn’t support intelligent design"
has been classified as an <IR> - Inconclusive Reason, following the steps outlined to decompose and analyze the argument (IDAA).
