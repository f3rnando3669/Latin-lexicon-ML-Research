To apply the decomposition of task (D) to the task of classifying the argument (IDA) in the conversation between Mike and Ken, we can break it down step by step:

### Decomposing the task (D) for argument classification (IDAA):
1. **Identify the propositions and reasons in the dialogue.**
2. **Recognize if any argument is being made.**
3. **Determine if the arguments align with any defective argument types (G, FE, IR, RR, WCB, FU, DEP).**
4. **Classify each statement or series of statements according to the identified defective argument types.**

### Step-by-Step Application (IDAA):

1. **Identify propositions and reasons:**
   - **Mike's first statement:**
     - Proposition (P): "It is morally wrong to cheat on your spouse."
     - Reason (R): "Why on earth would you have done that?" (Implicitly asking for justification).
   - **Ken's first statement:**
     - Proposition (P): "But what is morality exactly?"
     - Asking for the definition or reasoning behind Mike's statement.
   - **Mike's second statement:**
     - Proposition (P): "It’s a code of conduct shared by cultures."
     - Reason (R): This defines morality.
   - **Ken's second statement:**
     - Proposition (P): "But who creates this code?"
     - Questioning the source or legitimacy of the code mentioned by Mike.

2. **Recognize if any argument is being made:**
   - **Mike's argument:** Asserts that cheating on one's spouse is morally wrong and defines morality as a code of conduct shared by cultures.
   - **Ken's counter-argument:** Questions the definition and origin of morality to challenge Mike's assertion.

3. **Determine if the arguments align with any defective argument types:**
   - **Ken's first statement (P: What is morality exactly?):**
     - This can be seen as trying to deflect from the original assertion rather than addressing it directly.
     - This deflection could potentially fall under the category of an Inconclusive Reason (IR) since it doesn't directly dispute Mike's original assertion about cheating.
   - **Mike's second statement (R: It’s a code of conduct shared by cultures):**
     - This reason is attempting to define morality but might be too general or ambiguous.
     - Potentially, this could fall under Ambiguous Language Use (DEP) if the definition is vague and can be interpreted differently.
   - **Ken's second statement (P: Who creates this code?):**
     - This is again questioning the basis of Mike's statement without providing a counter-argument.
     - Can also be viewed as Inconclusive Reason (IR) because it merely questions the origin without addressing the morality of cheating directly.

4. **Classify each statement according to defective argument types:**
   - **Ken's first statement:** Potentially Inconclusive Reason (IR) because it deflects the original debate rather than directly challenging the claim.
   - **Mike's second statement:** Potentially Ambiguous Language Use (DEP) if the definition of morality provided is too vague to be effective in the argument.
   - **Ken's second statement:** Potentially Inconclusive Reason (IR) as it shifts the focus to the origin of the concept rather than addressing the ethical issue being discussed.

### Conclusion:

After applying IDAA, we can see that:
- **Ken's responses** both might demonstrate Inconclusive Reason (IR) as they deflect the argument rather than directly countering it.
- **Mike's definition of morality** might be seen as Ambiguous Language Use (DEP) if it doesn't sufficiently clarify the concept to effectively support the original proposition about cheating.
