To apply the concept of IDAA (the decomposition of the classification task, IDA, into specific steps) to the string "If we ban cell phones because they are bad for teenagers next the government will ban all iPods and eventually all video games as well," let's break down the process:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (P)
Firstly, identify the main proposition (P) in the statement.

- **Proposition (P):** "If we ban cell phones because they are bad for teenagers next the government will ban all iPods and eventually all video games as well."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (R)
Next, identify the reason (R) that sets forth the causal basis for the proposition.

- **Reason (R):** The inherent causal basis is that banning cell phones for being bad for teenagers would lead to the government banning other electronic devices like iPods and video games.

### Step 3: Consider the Proof of Reason (PR)
Determine if there is any proof or corroboration provided for the reason.

- **Proof of Reason (PR):** The statement does not provide additional arguments or evidence to corroborate the reason. It assumes a domino effect without substantiating this connection.

### Step 4: Classify the Argument Type
Based on the definitions of defective argument types (G, FE, IR, WCB, RR, FU, DEP), classify the given string.

Let's review the defective argument types again:

- **Generalization (G):** The proposition is based on some part or majority, but not fully applicable.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** Claiming to have enumerated all possibilities but missing some.
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** The reason does not conclusively demonstrate the proposition.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** Weak causal basis for the proposition.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** The reason repeats the proposition.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** Assuming something is universally agreed upon while it's in dispute.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** The proof can be interpreted in another unintended sense.

In this case, the argument type closely matches:

- **WCB (Insufficient Causal Basis):** The causal basis provided (that banning cell phones will lead to banning all iPods and video games) is a weak argument and not compelling or logically sound. Without further evidence or reasoning, this slippery slope assumption doesn't convincingly establish the proposition.

### Result
The string "If we ban cell phones because they are bad for teenagers next the government will ban all iPods and eventually all video games as well." can be classified as type <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis).

### Summary of Steps (D):
1. Identify the Proposition (P).
2. Identify the Reason (R).
3. Consider the Proof of Reason (PR).
4. Classify the argument type based on provided definitions.
5. Confirm the classification with reasoning.

Following these steps systematically, we've determined that the given argument is of type <WCB>.
