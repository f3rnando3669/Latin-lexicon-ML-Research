For 
To apply IDAA to classify the statement "All football players are dumb jocks," we will break down the task step-by-step. Here's the approach:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (P)
Establish the main assertion or proposition in the statement.

In this case, the proposition is:
- **P:** "All football players are dumb jocks."

### Step 2: Examine the Nature of the Proposition
Determine the nature of the proposition and see if it fits any known defective argument types.

### Step 3: Match the Proposition with Defective Argument Types
Evaluate whether the proposition matches characteristics of any of the defective argument types: Generalization (G), Incomplete Enumeration (FE), Inconclusive Reason (IR), Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR), Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB), Presumptuous Consensus (FU), or Ambiguous Language Use (DEP).

- **Generalization (G)**: The assertion applies to "all" football players based on either insufficient evidence or a non-representative subset. If the statement doesn't apply to all individuals but is generalized to everyone, it fits this type.

- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: In this case, itâ€™s not applicable since the statement makes a general claim rather than enumerating possibilities.

- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: Not relevant here as the statement makes a direct claim without giving a reason.

- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: Not relevant here as the statement lacks a reason that repeats the proposition.

- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: There is no causal basis presented in the statement.

- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: The statement does not rely on assumed universal agreement.

- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: Language can be interpreted as offensive or stereotypical, but it appears more to be overgeneralization.

### Step 4: Select the Defective Argument Type
From Step 3, it's evident that the proposition "All football players are dumb jocks" matches the characteristics of a Generalization (G). The statement takes a potentially non-representative subset or a partial observation and applies it to the entire group of football players without warranted evidence.

### Conclusion
The statement "All football players are dumb jocks" is classified under the defective argument type:
- **G (Generalization)**

This concludes the application of IDAA to the statement.
