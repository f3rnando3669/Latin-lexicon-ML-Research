To apply IDAA (the decomposition of the task into specific steps) to classify the string "Honesty is defined as always being honest," let's break it down step by step as follows:

### Step 1: Identify the Components
First, identify if the given string "Honesty is defined as always being honest" contains the necessary components of a complete argument: Proposition (P), Reason (R), and Proof of Reason (PR).

**String Analysis:**
- Proposition (P): Honesty is defined as always being honest.
- Reason (R): N/A (There is no additional reasoning provided to support the proposition.)
- Proof of Reason (PR): N/A (There is no additional proof provided to support the reasoning.)

### Step 2: Classify the Argument Type
Next, evaluate if the proposition (P) falls under any of the defective argument types. In particular, we need to see if it reflects Generalization (G), Incomplete Enumeration (FE), Inconclusive Reason (IR), Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB), Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR), Presumptuous Consensus (FU), or Ambiguous Language Use (DEP).

**String Analysis:**
- The string appears to present a definition. The proposition is "Honesty is defined as always being honest."

### Step 3: Identify Potential Defect
Determine which defect might be present in the given proposition.

- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: This is when the Reason (R) appears to be presented as justification but says precisely the same thing as the Proposition (P). In this case, there is no reasoning or proof presented, but rather a tautological definition where the term is defined using the term itself.

Therefore, based on the tautological nature of the argument where the definition simply repeats the term "honesty" without providing additional explanatory value, the characteristic aligning most closely with this defect is Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR).

### Step 4: Conclusion
Finally, conclude with the classification of the string.

**Conclusion:**
The string "Honesty is defined as always being honest" should be classified as **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)** because it repeats the term without providing an independent, explanatory reason.
