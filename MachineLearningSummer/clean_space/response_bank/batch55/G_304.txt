For 
To apply <IDAA> to the string "You smoke pot? If you keep doing that, you’ll be a heroin addict within two years," we need to decompose the task <IDA> into specific steps and then classify the argument type accordingly.

### Steps of Decomposition (<D>):

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
   - Determine the main assertion or proposition being made.

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   - Determine the causal basis provided to support the proposition.

3. **Identify the Defective Element:**
   - Examine the argument for any defects or weaknesses based on the defined categories.

### Application to the Given String:

#### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)
- The Proposition here is: "You’ll be a heroin addict within two years."

#### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)
- The Reason provided is: "If you keep doing that," implying that smoking pot will lead to heroin addiction.

#### Step 3: Identify the Defective Element
- Evaluate the Reason and how it supports the Proposition. 
  - Does the Reason establish a logical or causal basis for the Proposition?
  - Does the Reason conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the Proposition?

The string makes an assertion that continuing to smoke pot will lead to heroin addiction, which implies a strong, deterministic causal relationship between smoking pot and becoming a heroin addict. Let's classify this based on the types of defective arguments:

- **Generalization (<G>):** The argument extrapolates a specific outcome (heroin addiction) from a single action (smoking pot), suggesting this outcome will apply universally.
  
- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** Not applicable here since the argument does not attempt to list all possibilities.
  
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** The Reason does not conclusively demonstrate the Proposition. The causal link between smoking pot and becoming a heroin addict is not established logically or empirically in the argument.
  
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** The Reason lacks a compelling causal linkage. The assumption that smoking pot directly leads to heroin addiction is not substantiated, making the causal basis weak.
  
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** Not applicable, since the Reason and Proposition are not mere repetitions.
  
- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** Not applicable here since the argument does not claim universal agreement.
  
- **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):** Not applicable as the language doesn't seem ambiguous.

### Conclusion:
Upon this analysis, the string "You smoke pot? If you keep doing that, you’ll be a heroin addict within two years." is best classified under <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis). The Reason provided is weak because it fails to establish a compelling causal basis for the Proposition that smoking pot will lead to heroin addiction.
