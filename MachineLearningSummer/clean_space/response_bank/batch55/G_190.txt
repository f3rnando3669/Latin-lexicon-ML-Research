Sure, let's decompose the task of classifying the argument in the given string into specific steps and then apply those steps to identify the type of defective argument.

### Steps for Decomposing the Task of Classifying (D) <IDA>:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):** Determine the main statement or claim that is intended to be proven.
2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):** Determine the causal basis provided to support the Proposition.
3. **Check the Proof of Reason (<PR>):** Look for any additional arguments that corroborate the Reason.
4. **Identify Potential Defects:** Check against known types of defective arguments (Generalization, Incomplete Enumeration, Inconclusive Reason, Insufficient Causal Basis, Faulty Repetition of Proposition, Presumptuous Consensus, Ambiguous Language Use).
5. **Classify the Argument:** Based on the identified defects, classify the argument according to the types <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <WCB>, <RR>, <FU>, or <DEP>.

### Application of the Decomposition to the Given String (IDAA):

Let's apply the steps to the given string: "I have several female friends and every one of them loves country music. All females love country music."

#### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)
- **Proposition (<P>):** "All females love country music."

#### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)
- **Reason (<R>):** "I have several female friends and every one of them loves country music."

#### Step 3: Check the Proof of Reason (<PR>)
- There doesn't appear to be an additional argument specifically corroborating the reason. The argument relies on the initial Reason given.

#### Step 4: Identify Potential Defects
- The argument asserts that because several female friends (specific instances) love country music, this applies to all females (a broad category). This is indicative of the defect called **Generalization**.

#### Step 5: Classify the Argument
- The argument type is **Generalization (<G>)** because it bases a broad assertion on a limited number of examples.

### Conclusion
The given string "I have several female friends and every one of them loves country music. All females love country music." is classified as a **Generalization (G)**.
