For 
To apply <IDAA> to the string "Appealing to popularity or the fact that many people do something as an attempted form of validation," we need to take the decomposition of the advanced task of classifying this string into specific steps. Here’s how we can break it down:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition of <IDAA>:
1. **Identify the Nature of the String (<s>):**
   Analyze the given string to understand what type of argument it is describing.

2. **Evaluate Each Defective Argument Type:**
   Compare the characteristics of the string with each defective argument type (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>).

3. **Match the Characteristics:**
   Determine which defective argument type best fits the description provided in the string.

4. **Classify the String:**
   Assign the appropriate type to the string based on the evaluation.

### Application to "Appealing to popularity or the fact that many people do something as an attempted form of validation"

1. **Identify the Nature of the String (<s>):**
   The string describes a situation where an argument is validated based on the idea that many people accept it or participate in it.

   - **Content:** The argument relies on the fact that something is popular or that it is done by many people.
   - **Implied Reasoning:** It assumes that the correctness or validity of the proposition is established by its widespread acceptance or practice.

2. **Evaluate Each Defective Argument Type:**
   - **<G> (Generalization):** The string doesn’t generalize based on a part or majority of individuals.
   - **<FE> (Incomplete Enumeration):** The string doesn’t claim to list all possibilities.
   - **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason):** The string’s reason might not be conclusive, but it doesn’t focus on the conclusion’s strength.
   - **<RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition):** The string doesn’t repeat the proposition as its reason.
   - **<WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis):** The causal basis is weak if it relies solely on popularity, but this doesn’t address general opinion as proof.
   - **<FU> (Presumptuous Consensus):** The string primarily fits this category because it assumes consensus or popularity as definitive validation.
   - **<DEP> (Ambiguous Language Use):** The string’s language is clear in its intent.

3. **Match the Characteristics:**
   - The string that appeals to the fact that many people accept or do something is assuming its correctness based on presumed universal agreement.
   - This directly corresponds with the <FU> type, where a proposition is assumed certain because it is "universally agreed upon," even though it is still in dispute.

4. **Classify the String:**
   The most fitting classification for the string "Appealing to popularity or the fact that many people do something as an attempted form of validation" is **<FU> (Presumptuous Consensus)**.

### Conclusion:
By applying the steps of <IDAA> to the task of classifying the given string, we conclude that it falls under the defective argument type **<FU> (Presumptuous Consensus)**.
