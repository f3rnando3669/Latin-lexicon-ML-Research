For 
To apply the process of IDAA (the decomposition approach to classifying a given argument as one of the identified defective argument types) to the statement "Aliens must exist because most people believe in them," we will follow specific steps of decomposition. Letâ€™s break it down:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (D) of the Task (IDA):

1. **Identify Proposition (<P>) and Reason (<R>)**:
   - Find the main assertion (proposition) and the causal basis (reason) provided for that assertion.

2. **Evaluate the Proof of Reason (<PR>)**:
   - Determine if the reason provided is adequately supported by additional evidence or if it is weak.

3. **Classify the Argument**:
   - Check if the argument falls into one of the defective argument categories: <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>.

### Applying the Steps to the Given Statement:

#### Step 1: Identify Proposition (<P>) and Reason (<R>)
- **Proposition (<P>)**: "Aliens must exist."
  - This is the main assertion that the speaker is trying to prove.
- **Reason (<R>)**: "because most people believe in them."
  - This is the causal basis given for the proposition.

#### Step 2: Evaluate the Proof of Reason (<PR>)
- The statement provided does not offer any additional arguments or evidence that substantiate the reason (i.e., why the belief of most people is relevant or compelling), so we have no separate <PR> available.

#### Step 3: Classify the Argument

**Check for Defective Argument Types:**
- **Generalization (<G>)**: Not applicable here. The argument doesn't generalize a property based on a part/majority.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: Not applicable here. The argument does not involve an incomplete list of possibilities.
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: Potentially applicable. The reason "most people believe in them" does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of "Aliens must exist." Belief does not equate to proof.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: Applicable. The reason provided is weak because the fact that many people believe something does not constitute a compelling causal basis for proving existence.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: Not applicable here as the reason does offer a different point (belief vs. existence).
- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: Highly applicable. The argument assumes that the universal agreement among people is sufficient proof, which is presumptive because the actual existence of aliens is still in dispute.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**: Not applicable here. There is no ambiguous language in the reason provided.

### Conclusion:

The statement "Aliens must exist because most people believe in them" falls under the defective argument types of **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)** and **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**. The argument assumes that widespread belief is sufficient proof of existence, which is not a compelling causal basis and presumes consensus as an undisputed proof.

So, "Aliens must exist because most people believe in them" is classified as <WCB> and <FU>.
