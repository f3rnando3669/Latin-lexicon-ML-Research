For 
To apply \( IDAA \) to the given string, we will decompose the task of identifying the defect type \( IDA \) (i.e., which category of defective argument it falls into) into specific steps and follow them methodically. 

### Step-by-Step Decomposition and Analysis

**Step 1: Break down the string into its components**  
Our string \( s \) consists of two parts, an English version and a Spanish translation:

1. "If you allow one student to take an online course, soon everyone will want to, and the schools will be empty."
2. "Si permite que un estudiante tome un curso en línea, pronto todos querrán, y las escuelas estarán vacías."

**Step 2: Identify the proposition (\( P \))**  
Look for the main statement or claim being made (the proposition):

- \( P \): "Schools will be empty."

**Step 3: Identify the reason (\( R \))**  
Find the causal basis or reasoning provided to support the \( P \):

- \( R \): "If you allow one student to take an online course, soon everyone will want to."

**Step 4: Analyze the completeness and correctness of the \( R \)**
We need to assess the logical strength and completeness of \( R \):

- The argument claims that allowing one student to take an online course will lead to everyone wanting to take online courses, leading to empty schools. This is an assertion without sufficient evidence.

**Step 5: Classify the type of defect**
Compare the reasoning to the types of defective arguments:

- **Generalization (<G>)**: This seems to match since the reasoning generalizes from a single instance (one student) to everyone.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: Not applicable as the argument does not enumerate possibilities.
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: Could be relevant as the reason does not conclusively establish the proposition.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: This fits since the causal link between allowing one student and everyone taking online courses (resulting in empty schools) is weak and not compelling.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: Not applicable here.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: Not applicable as no consensus is assumed.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**: Not directly applicable as argument seems clear in intent.

Based on this analysis, the argument type is most likely <G> due to generalizing from a single instance to an entire population, and <WCB> because the causal basis is not compelling and weakly established.

**Step 6: Final Conclusion**  
Combine the steps and conclude which defect type applies:

The string "If you allow one student to take an online course, soon everyone will want to, and the schools will be empty." is primarily classified as a <G> (Generalization) argument and could also reasonably be seen as <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis).

The same conclusion applies to the Spanish version:

"Si permite que un estudiante tome un curso en línea, pronto todos querrán, y las escuelas estarán vacías."
