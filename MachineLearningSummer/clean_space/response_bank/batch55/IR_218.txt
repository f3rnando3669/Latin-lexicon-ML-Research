For 
Applying the IDAA to classify the defective argument type of the given statement, "Police officers agree that Blackjack Steering Wheel Locks are the most effective deterrent against car theft," involves breaking down the task into specific steps:

### Step 1: Identify Key Components
- **Proposition (<P>)**: This is the statement or claim to be proven. In this case:
  - "Blackjack Steering Wheel Locks are the most effective deterrent against car theft."
  
- **Reason (<R>)**: This is the justification provided for the proposition. In this case:
  - "Police officers agree."

### Step 2: Classify the Argument Type
To classify this statement, we need to examine whether it falls into any of the defective argument types defined earlier. Here are the options we need to evaluate:

1. **Generalization (<G>)**: This usually involves taking a small sample to assert a broad claim.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: This involves claiming a complete list when it's not.
3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: This is when the reason does not conclusively support the proposition.
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: This involves a weak causal basis for the proposition.
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: This is when the reason just repeats the proposition.
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: This is when consensus is assumed without proof, often stating it as universally agreed.
7. **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**: This involves ambiguous language that can be misinterpreted.

### Step 3: Evaluate Each Defective Argument Type

1. **Generalization (<G>)**: Not applicable here, as the claim doesn't seem to be overgeneralizing from a small or majority sample to the whole group or situation.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: Not applicable here, as there's no enumeration of possibilities.
3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: "Police officers agree" is a reason given but it’s not demonstrated directly how it conclusively supports the claim that the product is most effective.
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: "Police officers agree" could be seen as a weak basis since the agreement may not directly correlate with effectiveness. However, it points more towards a weak consensus rather than causality.
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: Not applicable, as the reason is not just a repetition of the proposition.
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: "Police officers agree" assumes that their agreement is a fact, which presumes consensus without presenting evidence for their unanimous support or expertise making their agreement relevant.
7. **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**: There is no indication of language that can be taken in a different sense than intended.

### Step 4: Final Classification
Upon close examination, the defective argument category that seems most applicable here is **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**. The argument takes "Police officers agree" as a given fact implying universal support, which is commonly disputable without evidence.

### Conclusion
The string "“Police officers agree that Blackjack Steering Wheel Locks are the most effective deterrent against car theft.”" is classified as **<FU>** (Presumptuous Consensus).
