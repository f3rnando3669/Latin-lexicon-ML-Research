For 
To apply <IDAA> to the given statement, we need to first decompose the task <IDA> (classifying the type of defective argument) into specific steps. Here is a detailed breakdown:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition of <t>

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):** 
   Recognize the main claim or assertion made in the argument.

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   Determine the causal basis provided to support the proposition.

3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>):**
   Look for any additional arguments or evidence meant to corroborate the reason.

4. **Analyze for any Defective Argument Types:**
   Compare the identified components against the definitions of defective argument types (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <WCB>, <RR>, <FU>, <DEP>).

5. **Classify the Defective Argument Type:**
   Based on the analysis, classify the argument into one of the defective argument types.

### Application of <IDAA> to the Given Statement

#### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)

Proposition (<P>): "It is clear that this is the right way to address this problem and we should all be providing this therapy whenever victims of domestic violence come to us for help."

#### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)

Reason (<R>): "There is no intervention for victims of domestic violence that has more empirical support from controlled studies than this one."

#### Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>)

Proof of Reason (<PR>): The statement that this intervention has "more empirical support from controlled studies than this one" serves as the proof of the reason.

#### Step 4: Analyze for any Defective Argument Types

1. **Generalization (<G>)**:
   - Not applicable. The argument does not generalize from a smaller sample to a whole population incorrectly.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**:
   - No claim of complete enumeration is made.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**:
   - The reason provided ("more empirical support from controlled studies") might not necessarily conclude that "this is the right way to address this problem" definitively.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**:
   - The reason ("more empirical support") is compelling, but might not be sufficient alone to conclude "we should all be providing this therapy."

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**:
   - The reason does not simply restate the proposition.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**:
   - The statement "It is clear that this is the right way to address this problem" implies that it is universally agreed upon without addressing any other therapeutic options or methods.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**:
   - No significant ambiguous language can be identified in the proposition or reason.

#### Step 5: Classify the Defective Argument Type

Based on the analysis, the argument most closely fits:

- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: The assertion "It is clear that this is the right way to address this problem" implies a consensus that may not exist. It presupposes universal agreement on the best therapy for victims of domestic violence without addressing alternative views or methods.

### Conclusion

The given statement is classified as a defective argument of type <FU> (Presumptuous Consensus).
