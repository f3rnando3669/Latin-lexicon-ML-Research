For 
To apply <IDAA> to the statement "America has to act now to reduce illegal immigration. Recent studies show that the vast majority of Americans think that illegal immigration is a problem," we will decompose the task of classifying the statement into specific steps. Here’s the step-by-step process:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
   - The proposition (P) in this case is: "America has to act now to reduce illegal immigration."

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   - The reason (R) provided for the proposition is: "Recent studies show that the vast majority of Americans think that illegal immigration is a problem."

3. **Classify the Type of Defective Argument:**
   - We need to identify if the argument falls into any of the defective argument types: Generalization (<G>), Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>), Inconclusive Reason (<IR>), Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>), Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>), Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>), or Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>).

4. **Analyze and Match:**
   - Consider if the reason (R) presented to support the proposition (P) matches any of the defective argument types:
     - <G> (Generalization): This involves making an assertion about all based on a part or majority. The statement doesn't directly generalize to "all Americans," but instead references the "vast majority."
     - <FE> (Incomplete Enumeration): This would involve claiming completeness while missing options. This does not seem to apply directly here.
     - <IR> (Inconclusive Reason): This involves a reason that doesn’t conclusively demonstrate the proposition’s correctness. This might be relevant here as public opinion doesn’t necessarily directly justify the necessity of action.
     - <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis): This involves a weak causal link for the proposition. The public opinion alone doesn't establish a strong causal basis for immediate action.
     - <RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition): This involves the reason merely restating the proposition. This is not the case here.
     - <FU> (Presumptuous Consensus): This involves assuming something is certain because it's "universally agreed upon." This could be relevant since it claims a consensus without interrogating its correctness or relevance to action.
     - <DEP> (Ambiguous Language Use): This involves ambiguous use of language. This doesn’t seem to be the case here.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The argument "Recent studies show that the vast majority of Americans think that illegal immigration is a problem" used to support the proposition "America has to act now to reduce illegal immigration" seems to suffer from:
     - **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: It presumes consensus on the action needed based on a survey of public opinion, which may not be universally accepted.
     - **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The link between public opinion and the necessity for immediate action isn't made compellingly.

Therefore, the final classification of the argument in the statement is **<WCB>** (Insufficient Causal Basis) primarily and **<FU>** (Presumptuous Consensus) secondarily.
