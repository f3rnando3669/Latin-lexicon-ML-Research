For 
To apply the ^<IDAA> to the task of classifying the string "This is an example of what logic fallacy?" we need to break down the advanced task \(t\) into specific steps, and then proceed to follow those steps systematically. The task \(t\) in this context is identifying the type of defective argument in the given string.

Let's decompose the task \(t\) (identifying and classifying the logical fallacy) into specific steps for clarity:

### Step 1: Understand the String
- Carefully read and interpret the string "This is an example of what logic fallacy?"

### Step 2: Identify the Components of the Argument
- Determine if the string includes or implies a Proposition \(P\), Reason \(R\), or Proof of Reason \(PR\).

### Step 3: Evaluate the Argument Components
- Analyze whether the identified \(P\), \(R\), or \(PR\) aligns with one of the specific defective argument types defined (\(G\), \(FE\), \(IR\), \(RR\), \(WCB\), \(FU\), or \(DEP\)).

### Step 4: Classify the Defective Argument
- Based on the analysis, classify the argument type (if any).

### Detailed Breakdown of Applying \(IDAA\):

#### Step 1: Understand the String
The string "This is an example of what logic fallacy?" is asking for the identification of a logical fallacy. This means the string itself is posing a question rather than presenting an argument.

#### Step 2: Identify the Components of the Argument
Since the string is a question and does not present a Proposition \(P\), Reason \(R\), or Proof of Reason \(PR\), it does not contain an argument that we can directly analyze. 

#### Step 3: Evaluate the Argument Components
Given that there are no clear components of an argument within the string (no \(P\), \(R\), or \(PR\)), we cannot evaluate it against the predefined defective argument types.

#### Step 4: Classify the Defective Argument
Since the question "This is an example of what logic fallacy?" does not itself provide an argument or a fallacy, it cannot be classified directly as any of the defective argument types (\(G\), \(FE\), \(IR\), \(RR\), \(WCB\), \(FU\), or \(DEP\)).

### Conclusion:
The string "This is an example of what logic fallacy?" does not present an argument and thus cannot be classified under any of the given defective argument types. The string is a question asking for identification rather than providing material to identify a fallacy. Therefore, applying \(IDAA\) results in the determination that this specific input string does not fall under any defective argument type.

If the task was to analyze a specific example of an argument provided, the process would proceed to further steps of identifying components and evaluating those against the defective argument types.
