For 
To apply <IDAA> (the application of decomposition to the task of identifying defective argument types) to the given string "We need to stop allowing colleges to increase tuition every year. The next thing we know, it's going to cost more to attend college for one semester than it is to buy a new home!", we will break down the task into specific steps and classify the argument type. 

### Step-by-Step Decomposition:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>) in the string.**
   - **Examine the statement and determine what is being set forth as the main claim.**

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>) supporting the Proposition.**
   - **Look for the causal basis provided for the Proposition.**

3. **Identify any Proof of Reason (<PR>) given.**
   - **Determine if there are any additional arguments presented to support the Reason.**

4. **Analyze for potential defective argument types.**
   - **Check if the Proposition (<P>) might be a Generalization (G) or Incomplete Enumeration (FE).**
   - **Evaluate if the Reason (<R>) could fit Inconclusive Reason (IR), Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB), or Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR).**
   - **Assess if the Proof of Reason (<PR>) could be Presumptuous Consensus (FU) or Ambiguous Language Use (DEP).**

### Detailed Step-by-Step Application:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
   - Proposition: "We need to stop allowing colleges to increase tuition every year."

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   - Reason: "The next thing we know, it's going to cost more to attend college for one semester than it is to buy a new home!"

3. **Identify any Proof of Reason (<PR>):**
   - The provided string does not contain additional arguments to corroborate the Reason. Therefore, no Proof of Reason (<PR>) is identified.

4. **Analyze for potential defective argument types:**
   - **Generalization (G):**
     - The statement implies a future scenario where tuition could exceed the cost of a new home but does not claim it as already happening based on a few examples. Hence, this does not strongly fit Generalization.
   
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):**
     - The string does not enumerate possibilities or claim completeness in listing possibilities. Thus, Incomplete Enumeration is not applicable.
   
   - **Inconclusive Reason (IR):**
     - The Reason given ("The next thing we know, it's going to cost more to attend college for one semester than it is to buy a new home!") is based on a speculative future scenario and does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the Proposition that colleges should stop increasing tuition.
   
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):**
     - The Reason is weak as it is speculative and does not provide a compelling, concrete causal link to the proposed action of stopping tuition increases.

   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):**
     - The Reason does not simply repeat the Proposition in different words. It provides a speculative consequence.

   - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):**
     - The Reason does not argue based on universal agreement; it does not fit this category.

   - **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):**
     - The Reason is not ambiguous in the sense that it can be taken in another sense than intended by the speaker.

After examining the steps above, the most fitting classification for the argument in the string provided is <IR> (Inconclusive Reason):

### Conclusion:
- The string "We need to stop allowing colleges to increase tuition every year. The next thing we know, it's going to cost more to attend college for one semester than it is to buy a new home!" should be classified as <IR> (Inconclusive Reason). The Reason provided does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the Proposition and is speculative in nature.
