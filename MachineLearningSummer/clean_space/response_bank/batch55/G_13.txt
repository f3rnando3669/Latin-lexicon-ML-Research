Sure, let's decompose the task <IDA> into specific steps and then apply it to classify the given string.

### Decomposition of <IDA> (Task \( t \) broken down into specific steps)
1. **Identify Proposition (<P>):**
   - Examine the statement to find the main assertion or claim.

2. **Identify Reason (<R>):**
   - Determine the causal basis provided for the proposition.

3. **Identify Proof of Reason (<PR>):**
   - Check for additional arguments that corroborate the reason.

4. **Check for Defective Arguments:**
   - Evaluate if the argument falls into any of the defective argument types:
     - **Generalization (<G>):** Assertion applied too broadly.
     - **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** Missed possibilities.
     - **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** Reason doesn't conclusively support proposition.
     - **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** Weak causal basis.
     - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** Reason is a repetition of the proposition.
     - **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** Assuming an argument as true by consensus.
     - **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):** Ambiguity in the language used.

### Application of \( IDAA \) to the given string:

1. **Identify Proposition (<P>):**
   - The main assertion is: "So you better take the story of Adam and Eve literally, before the phrase, 'that chicken looks delicious', takes on a whole new meaning."

2. **Identify Reason (<R>):**
   - The causal basis leading to the proposition is a chain of consequences starting from accepting that the story of Adam and Eve is figurative which ends with immoral behavior.

3. **Identify Proof of Reason (<PR>):**
   - There appear to be intermediate claims that are used to support the reasons:
     - Accepting the story of Adam and Eve as figurative will lead to accepting similar literary styles in the Old Testament.
     - This acceptance will lead to questioning the New Testament and the story of Jesus.
     - This questioning will lead to a spiritual interpretation of the resurrection of Jesus.
     - This spiritual interpretation will lead to losing the Christian faith, becoming an atheist, losing morals, and engaging in immoral behavior.

4. **Check for Defective Arguments:**
   - **Generalization (<G>):** There is a broad generalization that accepting one part of religious scripture as figurative will lead to the dismissal of multiple layers of the religious belief system.
   
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** The statement may overlook other outcomes or possibilities that do not lead to atheism and moral degradation.
   
   - **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** Each step in the chain of reasoning does not conclusively prove the next step. For example, accepting stories as figurative doesn't conclusively lead to questioning the New Testament or losing the Christian faith.
   
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** The causation between losing faith and moral degradation is weak and not necessarily compelling.
   
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** The reason advances a chain of suppositions, but it does not directly repeat the initial proposition.
   
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** There is an implied presumption that becoming an atheist universally leads to loss of morals and specific immoral behaviors, which is disputable.
   
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):** The phrase "that chicken looks delicious" as an implication for zoophilia is an ambiguous and hyperbolic expression that distorts the intended consequence.

### Conclusion:
The given string displays multiple defective argument types:
1. **Generalization (<G>)**
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**
3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**
5. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**
6. **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**

To classify the given string precisely, it encompasses mainly **Generalization (<G>)** and **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**, with elements of **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)** and **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**. However, since multiple issues are identified, the overarching issue appears to be **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)** with additional complexities.
