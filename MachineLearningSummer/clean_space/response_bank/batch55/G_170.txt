For 
To apply <IDAA> to the statement "Even without watching the movie, I just know that it would not be as good as the book," we start by performing the decomposition <D> of the task <IDA> into specific steps.

### Decomposition (<D>):
1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
   - Determine the main assertion or claim being made.

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   - Determine the causal basis or reason provided for the Proposition.

3. **Identify any Proof of Reason (<PR>):**
   - Determine if there are any supporting arguments aside from the main Reason.

4. **Evaluate for each defect type:**
   - Consider if the Proposition is a Generalization (<G>).
   - Consider if the Proposition suffers from Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>).
   - Consider if the Reason provided is Inconclusive (<IR>).
   - Consider if the Reason is a Faulty Repetition of the Proposition (<RR>).
   - Consider if the Reason has an Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>).
   - Consider if the Proof of Reason makes use of Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>).
   - Consider if the Proof of Reason has an Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>).

### Application of <D> to <IDA>:

**Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)**
- Proposition (<P>): "The movie would not be as good as the book."

**Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)**
- Reason (<R>): "Even without watching the movie, I just know."

**Step 3: Identify any Proof of Reason (<PR>)**
- There is no additional proof of reason provided in the statement.

**Step 4: Evaluate for each defect type**

1. **Generalization (<G>):**
   - The Proposition does not seem to be a generalization based on a subset of examples; it is a comparative statement about two specific works (a movie and a book).

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):**
   - The Proposition is not claiming a complete enumeration of possibilities, so this defect type does not apply.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):**
   - The Reason ("Even without watching the movie, I just know") is indeed inconclusive. It does not provide any concrete evidence or logical basis to support the claim that the movie is not as good as the book. This fits the description of an <IR> type defect, where <R> does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the <P>.

4. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):**
   - The Reason does not simply repeat the Proposition; thus, this defect type does not apply.

5. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):**
   - The Reason is not providing a causal basis at all, just a personal belief, making it inconclusive rather than insufficient. This suggests it is more primarily an <IR> than a <WCB>, although they are closely related.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):**
   - There is no presumption of universal agreement about the statement, so this defect type does not apply.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):**
   - The language used in the Reason is clear in its meaning (personal certainty without viewing the movie), and does not seem open to another interpretation than that intended by the speaker. This defect does not apply.

### Conclusion:
The defective argument type that best classifies the statement "Even without watching the movie, I just know that it would not be as good as the book" is <IR> - Inconclusive Reason. The Reason provided does not conclusively support the Proposition.
