To identify the fallacy in the string "A is part of B. A has property X. Therefore, B has property X," we will apply the decomposition procedure (<D>) to the classification task (<IDA>). Let’s proceed step by step:

### Step 1: Understand the Logical Form
First, we need to comprehend the logical form presented:
- **Premise 1:** A is part of B.
- **Premise 2:** A has property X.
- **Conclusion:** Therefore, B has property X.

### Step 2: Identify Potential Fallacies
Next, we review our types of defective arguments (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <WCB>, <RR>, <FU>, <DEP>) and analyze if this logical form maps onto any of these types.

### Step 3: Compare the Logical Form with Each Known Fallacy
1. **Generalization (<G>):** This occurs when an assertion based on one part or a majority is incorrectly generalized to all. The given form concludes that the whole has a property because one part has it. This suggests a form of generalization, but specifically directed towards parts and wholes.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** This involves listing only some possibilities and missing others, which doesn't seem relevant here.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** The reason provided should not conclusively demonstrate the proposition. This form doesn’t have this specific issue; it seems more specific to parts and wholes.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** This fallacy involves providing a weak causal basis. The logical form doesn't rely on a weak rationale but on improper attribution.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** This involves the reason being a repetition of the proposition. Here, the premises are clearly distinct from the conclusion.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** This suggests assuming something is true because it's universally agreed upon. This fallacy is not relevant to the logical form provided.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):** This fallacy is about ambiguous use of language, but the argument presented is quite clear and direct.

### Step 4: Determine the Most Fitting Fallacy
Given the detailed comparison, "A is part of B. A has property X. Therefore, B has property X" is best described by:
- **Generalization (<G>):** Specifically, it is an improper generalization where a property of a part (A) is incorrectly attributed to the whole (B). This is a classic example of the fallacy of **Composition**, a type of generalization.

### Step 5: Finalize the Classification
After decomposition and comparison, the string described matches the fallacy of **Generalization (<G>)**, more specifically known as the **Fallacy of Composition**.

Thus, we classify the string as:
- **<G> (Generalization)**
