For 
To apply <IDAA> to the statement "Utah passed a strict gun-control law, and crime there decreased. Therefore, gun-control laws decrease crime," we need to decompose the task of classifying the defective argument into specific steps.

### Decomposition of <IDA> Task

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>)**
   - A proposition is setting forth summarily what is intended to be proved.
   - In this case: "Gun-control laws decrease crime."

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>)**
   - Reason is setting forth the causal basis for the proposition.
   - In this case: "Utah passed a strict gun-control law, and crime there decreased."

3. **Evaluate the Proof of Reason (<PR>)**
   - Proof of Reason corroborates the Reason with additional arguments or evidence.
   - In this case: The statement implies that the example of Utah serves as the proof.

4. **Identify Potential Defective Argument Types (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <WCB>, <RR>, <FU>, <DEP>)**
   - Determine whether the Proposition, Reason, or Proof of Reason falls into any of the defective argument categories.

### Step-by-Step Application of <IDAA> to the Given Statement

**Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)**
   - Proposition (<P>): "Gun-control laws decrease crime."

**Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)**
   - Reason (<R>): "Utah passed a strict gun-control law, and crime there decreased."

**Step 3: Evaluate the Proof of Reason (<PR>)**
   - Proof of Reason (<PR>): The implication is that the observed reduction of crime in Utah after passing the gun-control law is a demonstration that gun-control laws decrease crime.

**Step 4: Identify Potential Defective Argument Types**

1. **Generalization (<G>)**
   - Does the Reason and Proof involve drawing a conclusion about all cases from one instance?
   - Yes, it does. The conclusion is generalized from the example of Utah to all instances.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**
   - Does the Proposition claim completeness when other possibilities are not accounted for?
   - This could be explored, but the main issue is more strongly aligned with generalization.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**
   - Does the Reason conclusively validate the Proposition?
   - No, the Reason does not conclusively prove that gun-control laws universally decrease crime.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**
   - Is the Reason weak in establishing causality for the Proposition?
   - Yes, the causal link between the law and crime reduction is assumed without considering other factors.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**
   - Does the Reason merely restate the Proposition?
   - No, the Reason is not just a repetition of the Proposition.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**
   - Is the Proof of Reason assumed to be self-evident or universally accepted?
   - Not applicable in this case.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**
   - Is there ambiguity in the language that could lead to misunderstanding?
   - Not particularly relevant here.

### Conclusion

Applying the <IDAA> method to the statement: "Utah passed a strict gun-control law, and crime there decreased. Therefore, gun-control laws decrease crime," the most suitable classification would be a combination of:
- **Generalization (<G>)**: The argument takes the example of Utah and generalizes it to all contexts.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The argument assumes a causality based on the temporal correlation without ruling out other influencing factors.

Therefore, the argument falls under both <G> and <WCB> types of defective arguments.
