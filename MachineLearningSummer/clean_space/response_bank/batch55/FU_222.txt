For 
Applying <IDAA> to the string "X is popular; therefore, X is right" involves decomposing the task of classifying the string into specific steps and then executing those steps. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

### Step 1: Decomposition of the Task (<D>)
We will decompose the task of identifying the defective argument type into specific steps:

1. **Identify Parts in the Statement:**
   - Determine the proposition <P> and the reason <R>.
   
2. **Analyze the Reason <R>:**
   - Assess what type of reasoning is used to support the proposition <P>.

3. **Check Against Defective Argument Types:**
   - Compare the identified reasoning with the definitions of <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, and <DEP> to find a match.

### Step 2: Apply Decomposition to the Given String

#### Step 2.1: Identify Parts in the Statement
- **Proposition <P>:** "X is right."
- **Reason <R>:** "X is popular."

#### Step 2.2: Analyze the Reason <R>
The reason given, "X is popular," is being used to support the proposition that "X is right." This implies that popularity is being presented as the causal basis for the correctness of the proposition.

#### Step 2.3: Check Against Defective Argument Types
We now examine whether this reasoning fits any of the defective argument types:

1. **Generalization <G>:** This is not a case of generalization as it doesn't involve referring a part to the whole.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration <FE>:** This argument doesn't claim to enumerate possibilities.
3. **Inconclusive Reason <IR>:** Popularity does not conclusively demonstrate correctness; it suggests that an inconclusive reason is being used.
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis <WCB>:** Popularity is not necessarily a compelling causal basis to conclude correctness.
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition <RR>:** The reason and the proposition are not saying the same thing.
6. **Presumptuous Consensus <FU>:** The argument does not assume universal agreement as its basis.
7. **Ambiguous Language Use <DEP>:** There is no ambiguous language use here.

### Step 3: Conclusion
Comparing the string "X is popular; therefore, X is right" to the defect types, we observe that the reason <R> ("X is popular") does not provide a conclusive or compelling causal basis for the proposition <P> ("X is right"). This fits best with:

- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** The provided reason does not conclusively establish the correctness of the proposition.
  
Therefore, the classification of the string "X is popular; therefore, X is right" is of type <IR>.
