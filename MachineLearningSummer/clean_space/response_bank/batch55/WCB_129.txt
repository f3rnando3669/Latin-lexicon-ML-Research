For 
To apply <IDAA> to the given argument "The presence of police at protests cause an escalation of violence. It was the case that at the protest last night attended by uniformed police, there was an escalation of violence. Therefore, police should not be at protests," we'll decompose <IDA> into specific steps and then apply this decomposition sequentially to identify the type of defective argument.

**Step 1: Identify the Proposition (P), Reason (R), and Proof of Reason (PR) in the argument.**

- **Proposition (P):** "The presence of police at protests cause an escalation of violence."
- **Reason (R):** "At the protest last night attended by uniformed police, there was an escalation of violence."
- **Proof of Reason (PR):** It is implicitly stated and derived from the observation, but not explicitly additional.

**Step 2: Evaluate <P> to identify if it could be a Generalization (G).**

- **Generalization (G):** Assertion based on some individual cases, not necessarily applicable to all.
- Here, P asserts that the presence of police always causes escalation of violence based on a single instance ("the protest last night"). Thus, it generalizes that particular instance to all protests.
- **Conclusion:** Yes, this element fits the definition of Generalization (G).

**Step 3: Check if P falls under Incomplete Enumeration (FE).**

- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** Assertion that misses some pertinent possibilities.
- Since P does not claim a complete enumeration but rather a direct correlation, FE is not applicable.
- **Conclusion:** No, this element does not fit Incomplete Enumeration (FE).

**Step 4: Check if Reason (R) could be classified as Inconclusive Reason (IR).**

- **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** R does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of P.
- R is based on a single instance and doesn't conclusively prove that the presence of police always escalates violence at protests.
- **Conclusion:** Yes, R is an Inconclusive Reason (IR).

**Step 5: Check if Reason (R) fits Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR).**

- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** R says precisely the same as P.
- R and P are not the same exact statement but they are tautologically similar, although not exactly verbatim.
- **Conclusion:** No, this element does not fit Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR).

**Step 6: Check if Reason (R) has Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB).**

- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** R is weak if the causal basis is not compelling.
- Here, a single instance is used to justify a general causality which is an insufficient causal basis.
- **Conclusion:** Yes, R has Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB).

**Step 7: Check if Proof of Reason (PR) fits Presumptuous Consensus (FU).**

- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** PR assumed as certain on a disputed point as universally agreed upon.
- There's no explicit PR here claiming universal agreement, so FU does not apply.
- **Conclusion:** No, this element does not fit Presumptuous Consensus (FU).

**Step 8: Check if Proof of Reason (PR) falls into Ambiguous Language Use (DEP).**

- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** PR can be taken in another sense.
- No ambiguous language is directly presented in the argument's PR.
- **Conclusion:** No, this element does not fit Ambiguous Language Use (DEP).

**Summarize the results:**

- **Generalization (G):** Yes
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** No
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** Yes
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** No
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** Yes
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** No
- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** No

**Final Classification:**
The argument is classified primarily as a **Generalization (G)**, **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**, and **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**, indicating multiple defects in reasoning.

By following these steps meticulously, we applied the decomposition (D) of the classification task (IDA) to the argument provided.
