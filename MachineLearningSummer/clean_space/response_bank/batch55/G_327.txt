For 
To apply IDAA (decomposition of IDA) to the task of classifying the argument "War on drugs instills fear to criminals so it can stop the crimes in the Philippines," we'll take it step by step. Let's start by breaking down the advanced task \( t \) (identifying the defective type of argument) into specific steps \( D \):

1. **Identify the Proposition (P)** - Determine what is being claimed.
2. **Identify the Reason (R)** - Determine the causal basis being used to support the proposition.
3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (PR)** - Check if additional arguments are provided to support the reason.
4. **Classify Defective Argument Type** - Based on the identification, classify the argument as one of the defective types defined (G, FE, IR, RR, WCB, FU, DEP).

Now, let's apply these steps to the argument "War on drugs instills fear to criminals so it can stop the crimes in the Philippines."

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (P)

**Proposition (P):** The war on drugs can stop the crimes in the Philippines.

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (R)

**Reason (R):** War on drugs instills fear in criminals.

### Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason (PR)

**Proof of Reason (PR):** There doesn't appear to be a detailed argument or additional evidence presented in the given statement to support the reason. The statement is brief and doesn't expand on how the fear instilled translates to stopping crimes.

### Step 4: Classify Defective Argument Type

Considering the definitions of defective arguments:

1. **Generalization (G):** Assess if the argument is making a general statement about all criminals based on some.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** Check if the argument misses out on other pertinent causes or possibilities in stopping crimes.
3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** Determine if the reason provided (instilling fear) conclusively supports the proposition.
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** Evaluate if the causal basis (fear instilled by the war on drugs) is compelling enough to support the proposition.
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** Check if the reason is just a rephrasing of the proposition.
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** Determine if the argument relies on a claimed universal agreement.
7. **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** Assess if there is any ambiguity in the terms used.

Given the statement:

- The **Reason** provided doesn't conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the **Proposition**. Instilling fear might not directly result in stopping crimes, and there are many factors to consider in crime reduction. Hence, this is a type of **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**.

Therefore, the classification of the argument "War on drugs instills fear to criminals so it can stop the crimes in the Philippines" is **<IR>** (Inconclusive Reason).
