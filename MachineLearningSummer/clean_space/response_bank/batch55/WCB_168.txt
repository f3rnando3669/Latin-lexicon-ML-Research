For 
To apply the process of <IDAA> to the given argument, we need to systematically decompose the task of classifying the defective arguments into specific steps. Hereâ€™s how we can go about it:

### Step-by-Step Breakdown of <D> Applied to <IDA>:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
   - Determine what the argument is intending to prove.

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   - Determine the causal basis or explanation provided for the proposition.

3. **Examine the Proof of Reason (<PR>):**
   - Check for any supporting arguments that corroborate the provided reason.

4. **Analyze for Defective Argument Types:**
   - Compare the identified parts (<P>, <R>, and <PR>) against the definitions of defective argument types (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <WCB>, <RR>, <FU>, and <DEP>).

5. **Classify the Argument:**
   - Decide which defective argument type(s), if any, apply to the given argument.

### Application of <IDAA> to the Argument:
**Argument:** "Last year, the city of Brookfield allocated more money to public parks. This year, however, littering increased, so the increase in park funding must have been responsible."

#### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)
- Proposition: "The increase in park funding must have been responsible for the increase in littering."

#### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)
- Reason: "Last year, the city of Brookfield allocated more money to public parks."

#### Step 3: Examine the Proof of Reason (<PR>)
- Proof of Reason: The argument does not provide additional supporting arguments or evidence beyond the increase in park funding and the increase in littering.

#### Step 4: Analyze for Defective Argument Types
- **Generalization (<G>):** The argument does not seem to generalize from a specific or partial observation to a broader conclusion.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** The argument does not enumerate possibilities but jumps to a conclusion without considering other potential reasons.
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** The reason given does not conclusively indicate the correctness of the proposition. There could be many other factors leading to an increase in littering.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** The provided reason (increase in park funding) does not serve as a compelling causal explanation for the increase in littering.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** The reason is not just repeating the proposition; it does provide a distinct fact.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** The argument does not claim its statement is universally agreed upon without dispute.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):** The argument does not involve ambiguous language that could be interpreted in an unintended manner.

#### Step 5: Classify the Argument
- The most fitting classifications for this argument are likely **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** and **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**. The reason (allocation of more money to public parks) does not conclusively demonstrate that it's the cause of increased littering. Furthermore, the causal link suggested is weak and unconvincing without additional supporting evidence.

### Conclusion
The argument "Last year, the city of Brookfield allocated more money to public parks. This year, however, littering increased, so the increase in park funding must have been responsible." can be classified under the defective argument types **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** and **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**.
