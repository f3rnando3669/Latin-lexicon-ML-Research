For 
To apply IDAA (the decomposition of the task IDA into specific steps) to classify the argument "Mrs. Collier, we can't take a quiz tomorrow! The new season of Game of Thrones premieres tonight!!", let's break down the process step by step.

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition <P>
The proposition (P) is the central claim that is being made. Here, the claim is:
- **P:** "We can't take a quiz tomorrow."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason <R>
The reason (R) is what is offered in support of the proposition to establish its truth. In this case, the reason provided is:
- **R:** "The new season of Game of Thrones premieres tonight."

### Step 3: Determine if There is a Proof of Reason <PR>
A Proof of Reason (PR) would involve additional arguments or evidence supporting the reason. Here, no further evidence or arguments are provided to support the reason.

### Step 4: Classify the Argument
Now, we classify the argument according to the defective argument types defined:

1. **Generalization (G):** The claim does not involve applying a single instance to all instances.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** The argument does not present an incomplete list of possibilities.
3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** The reason offered (the premiere of a TV show) does not conclusively demonstrate why they cannot take a quiz.
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** The causal link between the reason and the proposition is weak; watching TV tonight does not compel the inability to take a quiz tomorrow.
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** The reason is not a mere restatement of the proposition.
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** There is no appeal to a supposed universal agreement or consensus.
7. **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** The language use in the argument does not appear ambiguous.

Given the analysis above, the argument most closely aligns with:

- **IR (Inconclusive Reason):** The fact that the new season of Game of Thrones premieres tonight does not provide a conclusive reason why the quiz cannot be taken tomorrow.
- **WCB (Insufficient Causal Basis):** The causal basis provided (i.e., watching a TV show) is not a compelling reason to establish the claim about the inability to take a quiz.

### Conclusion
The argument "Mrs. Collier, we can't take a quiz tomorrow! The new season of Game of Thrones premieres tonight!!" can be classified under <IR> (Inconclusive Reason) and <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis).
