For 
Let us apply the decomposition of the advanced task \(<t>\) into specific steps in order to classify the given string \(<s>\) as one of the defective argument types using \(<IDAA>\).

### Step-by-Step Decomposition \(<D>\) of the Task \(<IDA>\):
1. **Identify the Proposition \(<P>\)**: Determine what the speaker is trying to assert or prove in their argument.
2. **Identify the Reason \(<R>\)**: Determine the causal basis or justification the speaker provides for the Proposition \(<P>\).
3. **Evaluate the Reason \(<R>\)**: Check if the Reason (\(R\)) presents a strong and compelling case to establish the Proposition (\(P\)).
4. **Identify the Proof of Reason \(<PR>\)**: Check if there are additional arguments or proofs provided to corroborate the Reason.
5. **Classify the Argument**: Based on the identified Proposition, Reason, and Proof of Reason, classify the argument as one of the defective argument types (\(G\), \(FE\), \(IR\), \(RR\), \(WCB\), \(FU\), \(DEP\)).

### Applying \(<IDAA>\) to the given string \(<s>\):

1. **Identify the Proposition \(<P>\):**
   - Proposition (\(P\)): "All Debate classes must be hard.”

2. **Identify the Reason \(<R>\):**
   - Reason (\(R\)): "My roommate said her Debate class was hard, and the one that I'm in right now is hard, too.”

3. **Evaluate the Reason \(<R>\):**
   - The Reason is based on the experiences of only two individuals (the speaker and the roommate). It generalizes the difficulty of all Debate classes based on this limited sample.

4. **Identify the Proof of Reason \(<PR>\):**
   - In this argument, there does not seem to be an additional Proof of Reason (more arguments or evidence) beyond the anecdotes mentioned.

5. **Classify the Argument:**
   - The argument asserts that all Debate classes are hard based on the experience of just the speaker and her roommate. This fits the definition of a Generalization (\(G\)).

   > Defective Argument Type \(<G>\) (Generalization): The \(P\) is an assertion based on some one part or on a majority of individuals, but not necessarily applicable to all, is referred to all.

### Result:
The given string \("My roommate said her Debate class was hard, and the one that I'm in right now is hard, too. All Debate classes must be hard!”\) is classified as \(G\) (Generalization).
