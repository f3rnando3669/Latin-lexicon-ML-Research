Sure, let's apply the decomposition of the task of classifying the defective argument type to the given string "All students are good and all clowns are bad."

### Step-by-Step Decomposition:
1. **Identify the Propositions (P):**
   - Proposition 1 (P1): All students are good.
   - Proposition 2 (P2): All clowns are bad.

2. **Identify the Reason (R):**
   - There are no explicit reasons (R) stated in the string for these propositions. The statement is declarative without accompanying causal bases or reasons.

3. **Check if the Propositions (P) involve Generalization (G):**
   - Evaluate if the statement takes a characteristic from one part or a majority and applies it to the whole.

4. **Check for Incomplete Enumeration (FE):**
   - Evaluate if the statement claims to enumerate all possibilities but misses pertinent ones.

5. **Check for Inconclusive Reason (IR):**
   - Evaluate if any reasons provided do not conclusively support the propositions.

6. **Check for Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):**
   - Evaluate if the reasons provided are weak and do not compellingly support the propositions.

7. **Check for Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):**
   - Evaluate if the reasons are just repetitions of the propositions.

8. **Check for Presumptuous Consensus (FU):**
   - Evaluate if additional supporting reasons are cited based on presumptive consensus.

9. **Check for Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):**
   - Evaluate if the language used can lead to any ambiguity in interpretation.

### Applying the Decomposition Steps:
1. **Identify the Propositions (P1 and P2):**
   - P1: "All students are good."
   - P2: "All clowns are bad."

2. **Identify the Reason (R):**
   - No explicit reasons (R) are provided for these propositions in the given string.

3. **Generalization (G):**
   - Both P1 and P2 are generalizations.
   - P1 assumes that because some or most students may be good, all students are good.
   - P2 assumes that because some or most clowns may be bad, all clowns are bad.
   - This type of argument is classified as Generalization (G).

4. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):**
   - The statement does not involve a claim of complete enumeration of possibilities; therefore, FE is not applicable here.

5. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):**
   - No reasons (R) are provided, so this category (IR) does not apply directly, although the absence of reasons could imply inconclusive support in another context.

6. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):**
   - No reasons (R) are available to evaluate for sufficiency, so WCB is not applicable here.

7. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):**
   - There are no reasons (R) stated that repeat the propositions (P1 or P2).

8. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):**
   - There is no assumption of consensus presented in the string. So, FU is not applicable.

9. **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):**
   - The statements are clear and not ambiguous. Therefore, DEP is not applicable.

### Conclusion:
Given the above analysis, the string "All students are good and all clowns are bad," is best classified as a defective argument type called **Generalization (G)**.
