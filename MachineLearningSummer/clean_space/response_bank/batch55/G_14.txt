For 
To apply <IDAA> (the application of the decomposition process to the task of classifying a string as a specific type of defective argument) to the given statement, "Some students who attend tutoring over the summer are not very intelligent. Since Beth attended summer tutoring, she is not a very good student," let's break down the process step by step:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition and Application:

1. **Identify and understand the propositions and reasoning in the argument:**
   - **Proposition (<P>):** The core assertion here seems to be "Beth is not a very good student."
   - **Reason (<R>):** The basis for this proposition is "Beth attended summer tutoring."
   - **Underlying assumption (implied <P>):** "Some students who attend tutoring over the summer are not very intelligent."

2. **Analyze the Reason (<R>) and its adequacy in supporting the Proposition (<P>):**
   - Is the reasoning valid and sufficient?
   - Do the reason and the proposition accurately connect logically?

3. **Compare the structure of the argument to the types of defective arguments defined earlier:**
   - **Generalization (<G>):** Is this a case where the conclusion is generalized from a specific or limited set of instances?
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** Does the argument claim completeness but omit some possibilities?
   - **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** Does the reason fail to conclusively support the proposition?
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** Is the causal basis for the proposition weak?
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** Does the reason simply restate the proposition?
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** Is there an assumption of universal agreement on something still in dispute?
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):** Is the proof or language used ambiguous, leading to confusion?

### Application to the given statement:

1. **Evaluate the Proposition and Reason:**
   - **Proposition (<P>):** "Beth is not a very good student."
   - **Reason (<R>):** "Since Beth attended summer tutoring."

2. **Compare to defective argument types:**
   - **Generalization (<G>):**
     - The argument assumes that because "some students who attend tutoring over the summer are not very intelligent," it follows that Beth is also not intelligent or not a very good student just because she attended summer tutoring.
     - This is a classic case of overgeneralization. The quality of some students attending summer tutoring cannot be generalized to every individual who attends.
   
### Conclusion:

The given argument fits the definition of a **Generalization (<G>)** with the following reasoning:
- The argument unjustly generalizes the quality of a specific group ("some students who attend tutoring over the summer are not very intelligent") to draw a conclusion about an individual (Beth) who is a member of that group without sufficient evidence to support that generalization.

Thus, by applying the **decomposition** process (<D>) to the classification task (<IDA>), we conclude that the argument's type is <G> â€” Generalization.
