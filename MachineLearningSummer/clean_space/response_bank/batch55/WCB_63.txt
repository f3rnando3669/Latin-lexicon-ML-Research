For 
To apply \(\text{IDAA}\) to the given string, "The best example of this fallacy is presented by the person who coined this term, Nassim Nicholas Taleb in his 2007 book, The Black Swan. There are two people," we must first decompose the task of classifying into specific steps. Here are the steps for \(\text{D}\) applied to \(\text{IDA}\):

1. **Identify the core claim or proposition:**
   - Extract the main assertion from the string.

2. **Analyze the Reason (if present):**
   - Determine the supporting reason provided for the main assertion.

3. **Check for Proof of Reason (if present):**
   - Look for additional arguments or evidence that corroborates the reason provided.

4. **Classify based on Defective Arguments:**
   - Compare the identified parts against the definitions of defective argument types (\(<G>\), \(<FE>\), \(<IR>\), \(<WCB>\), \(<RR>\), \(<FU>\), \(<DEP>\)) and classify accordingly.

5. **Justify the classification:**
   - Provide a rationale for why the argument fits a particular defective type.

Let’s apply these steps to the given string:

### Step 1: Identify the core claim or proposition
The main assertion in the string is:
- "The best example of this fallacy is presented by the person who coined this term, Nassim Nicholas Taleb in his 2007 book, The Black Swan."

### Step 2: Analyze the Reason (if present)
The string mentions:
- "There are two people"
However, it does not provide a reason that supports the core claim directly. This might suggest a missing Reason component.

### Step 3: Check for Proof of Reason (if present)
There is no additional corroborative argument or evidence provided within the given string itself.

### Step 4: Classify based on Defective Arguments
Based on the definitions of defective arguments:
- **Generalization (<G>)**: Not applicable since it’s not asserting that a characteristic of some applies to all.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: Possible, if considering the claim about "two people" but this part of the assertion seems disjointed.
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: Insufficient information to determine conclusiveness of reason as the reason isn’t fully stated.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: Also possible if the reason given isn’t compelling enough, but since the reason isn't clear, hard to evaluate.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: Inapplicable as no repetitive restatement occurs.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: Not applicable based on the given text.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**: Could be applicable if the “two people” part is meant to create an ambiguity.

### Step 5: Justify the classification
The most fitting classification appears to be \(<FE>\) or \(<IR>\), as the statement implies a proposition without providing a complete or conclusive reason. However, given the information:

An argument in the string is:
- "There are two people," without further elaboration capturing the completeness of examples, suggesting potential incompleteness.

**Conclusion**: The string most likely represents a defective argument of type \(<FE>\) (Incomplete Enumeration) \(as\) it claims to present the "best example" without giving a full and complete enumeration/evidence for this assertion.

Thus, applying \(\text{IDAA}\) to the string results in classifying it as \<FE>.
