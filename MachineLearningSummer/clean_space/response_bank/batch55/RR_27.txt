For 
To apply the advanced task of classifying a string (IDA) to "I hated the movie because it was the worst movie I ever saw," we need to decompose this task into specific steps (D). Let's break it down step by step.

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (\<P\>)
Proposition (P) is the part of a complete argument that summarizes what we intend to prove.

- **Proposition (P)**: "I hated the movie."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (\<R\>)
Reason (R) sets forth the causal basis for the proposition, establishing the truth of what is being urged.

- **Reason (R)**: "because it was the worst movie I ever saw."

### Step 3: Evaluate the Reason (\<R\>)
We need to determine if the Reason (R) provides a compelling causal basis for the Proposition (P).

### Step 4: Check for Defective Argument Types
Now, we evaluate the Reason (R) for each possible defective argument type:

#### Generalization (\<G\>)
- Is the Proposition based on a sample that might not apply to all cases?
  
  **Not Applicable:** The proposition does not generalize a larger group; it is a personal experience.

#### Incomplete Enumeration (\<FE\>)
- Does the Proposition claim to have considered all possibilities but missed some?

  **Not Applicable:** The proposition does not enumerate possibilities.

#### Inconclusive Reason (\<IR\>)
- Does the Reason (R) conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the Proposition (P)?

  **Applicable:** "It was the worst movie I ever saw" does not conclusively show why the movie is bad in any objective sense. It is more of a personal opinion and does not provide a universal standard.

#### Insufficient Causal Basis (\<WCB\>)
- Is the Reason (R) weak because the causal basis is not compelling?

  **Applicable:** The statement "it was the worst movie I ever saw" is highly subjective and does not provide a compelling causal basis for why the movie should be hated.

#### Faulty Repetition of Proposition (\<RR\>)
- Does the Reason (R) repeat the Proposition (P) without introducing new information?

  **Not Applicable:** The Proposition and the Reason are not identical.

#### Presumptuous Consensus (\<FU\>)
- Is the Reason (R) assumed to be certain because "it is universally agreed upon," a thing which is still in dispute?

  **Not Applicable:** The "Reason" is not based on a supposed universal agreement.

#### Ambiguous Language Use (\<DEP\>)
- Can the Reason (R) be taken in another sense than the speaker intended?

  **Not Applicable:** The language used is not ambiguous in this context.

### Step 5: Classify the Defective Argument Type
Based on our evaluation, the statement's Reason (R) fails to conclusively support the Proposition (P) and the causal basis is not compelling. Therefore:

- The argument is classified as **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** because the Reason provided does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the Proposition.
- The argument is also classified as **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)** because the Reason does not provide a compelling causal basis.

### Conclusion
The string "I hated the movie because it was the worst movie I ever saw" exhibits qualities of both **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** and **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**. These two defective argument types indicate that the Reason provided is not substantial enough to convincingly support the Proposition.
