To apply the process of decomposing the task of classifying the defective argument in the string "You were late tonight. You must be cheating!" into specific steps, we can follow this structured approach. Here is the detailed decomposition (`D`) and application to our specific string:

### Steps for Decomposition (<D>):
1. **Identify Proposition (P)**: Determine the main assertion or claim in the argument.
2. **Identify Reason (R)**: Determine the causal or supporting basis provided for the Proposition.
3. **Evaluate Causal Basis**: Examine if the Reason conclusively supports the Proposition.
4. **Identify Defective Argument Type**: Compare the argument to known defective types and classify it accordingly.

### Application (<IDAA>) to the string "You were late tonight. You must be cheating!":

**Step 1: Identify Proposition (P)**
- Proposition: "You must be cheating."

**Step 2: Identify Reason (R)**
- Reason: "You were late tonight."

**Step 3: Evaluate Causal Basis**
- Here we examine whether the reason "You were late tonight" conclusively or even sufficiently supports the claim "You must be cheating." 

**Step 4: Identify Defective Argument Type**
1. **Generalization (G)**:
   - This would apply if the proposition was a broad claim made on limited evidence. It's not entirely about generalization of a group, so it's unlikely to be (G).
   
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**:
   - This focuses on the failure to consider all possibilities. The string doesn't claim to cover all possibilities of why someone is late, so it's not a clear case of (FE).
   
3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**:
   - This seems plausible because the reason given (being late) does not conclusively support or prove the claim of cheating. 

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**:
   - The causal link here is weak: being late does not strongly suggest cheating without further evidence. This also seems plausible.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**:
   - This doesn't fit because the reason given ("You were late tonight") is not repeating the same claim as the proposition ("You must be cheating"), so it's not (RR).

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**:
   - This doesn't apply as the argument doesn't claim "everyone knows this to be true," so it's not (FU).

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**:
   - This doesn't apply as there's no ambiguity in the language used. The terms are relatively clear and straightforward.

After comparing with the types, we can classify it as:

- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: Because the relationship between being late and cheating is not conclusively established.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: Because the provided reason does not strongly or compellingly support the proposition.

Thus, the original statement "You were late tonight. You must be cheating!" can be classified primarily as **<IR>** with a secondary classification of **<WCB>** due to its weak causal linkage.
