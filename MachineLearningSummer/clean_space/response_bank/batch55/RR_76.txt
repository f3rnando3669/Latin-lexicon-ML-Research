For 
To apply the process of decomposition (\<D\>) to the task of classifying a string (\<IDA\>), we'll break down the classification process step by step. Let's take the string "This is an example of....". Here's the step-by-step decomposition:

### Step 1: Initial Assessment
- **Input**: String **s** ("This is an example of....")
- **Objective**: Determine whether the string matches any of the defective argument types.
  
### Step 2: Identify the Core Components
- **Action**: Parse the string to see if it falls under immediate identifiable categories.
- **Consider**: Look for indicators of a proposition (**P**), reason (**R**), or proof of reason (**PR**).

### Step 3: Compare String Against Definitions
- Compare the string to the characteristics of each defective argument type:
  - **\<G\>: Generalization**
  - **\<FE\>: Incomplete Enumeration**
  - **\<IR\>: Inconclusive Reason**
  - **\<WCB\>: Insufficient Causal Basis**
  - **\<RR\>: Faulty Repetition of Proposition**
  - **\<FU\>: Presumptuous Consensus**
  - **\<DEP\>: Ambiguous Language Use**

### Step 4: Focus on Linguistic Cues
- **Action**: Look for keywords or structures in the string that correspond to any defective argument types.
- For instance:
  - "Always," "all," "none" → Potential **\<G\>**
  - "We have covered everything," "all cases" → Potential **\<FE\>**
  - "Because I said so," "obviously" without explanation → Potential **\<IR\> or RR\>**

### Step 5: Elimination Process
- **Action**: Sequentially eliminate argument types that do not fit the string based on their definitions and distinguishing features.
- **Check**: Does the string specifically mention universal consensus (****Potential \**FU\ **) or ambiguous language (****Potential \**DEP\ **)?

### Step 6: Final Classification
- **Action**: Based on the features identified in previous steps, categorize the string into one of the defective argument types.
  
### Applied Example: "This is an example of...."

Now let's apply this step-by-step process to the string "This is an example of....":

#### Step 1: Initial Assessment
- The string is vague and does not present enough information up-front.

#### Step 2: Identify the Core Components
- The string doesn’t clearly show a proposition (\<P\>), reason (\<R\>), or proof of reason (\<PR\>).

#### Step 3: Compare String Against Definitions
- We proceed to compare the given string with defective argument types.
  
#### Step 4: Focus on Linguistic Cues
- The phrase "This is an example of...." is incomplete. It implies the start of an enumeration or categorization without completion.

#### Step 5: Elimination Process
- **\<G\>: Generalization** — The string doesn't provide enough to stress on generalization from a single or majority case to all cases.
- **\<IR\>: Inconclusive Reason** — Not applicable since the string doesn't provide a reason.
- **\<WCB\>: Insufficient Causal Basis** — Not applicable for the same reason as above.
- **\<RR\>: Faulty Repetition of Proposition** — Not applicable since there is no proposition and reason presented.
- **\<FU\>: Presumptuous Consensus** — Not applicable here.
- **\<DEP\>: Ambiguous Language Use** — Not necessarily ambiguous in intention, but rather incomplete.
- **\<FE\>: Incomplete Enumeration** — The string starts what seems to be an enumeration but leaves it incomplete.

#### Step 6: Final Classification
The most fitting defective argument type for "This is an example of...." is **\<FE\>: Incomplete Enumeration**, as it starts but does not complete the enumeration of examples, leaving the proposition defective.

Therefore, 

```plaintext
"This is an example of...." is of type <FE>.
```
