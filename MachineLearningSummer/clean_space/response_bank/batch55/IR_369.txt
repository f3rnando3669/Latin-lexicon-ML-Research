For 
To apply the <IDAA> methodology to the argument "You oppose a senator's proposal to extend government-funded health care to poor minority children because that senator is a liberal Democrat," we need to dissect this advanced task (classifying the argument type) into specific, manageable steps.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition of the Task:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
   - The proposition in the argument can be formulated as: "One should oppose the senator's proposal to extend government-funded health care to poor minority children."

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   - The reason given in the argument is: "because that senator is a liberal Democrat."

3. **Analyze the causal basis of <R> for the <P>:**
   - We need to evaluate whether the fact that the senator is a liberal Democrat provides a solid causal basis for opposing the proposal.

4. **Determine if <R> is conclusive for <P>:**
   - Check if the reason conclusively demonstrates the correctness of the proposition.

5. **Investigate additional points, if applicable, for <PR>:**
   - We should check if there are any further arguments that support the reason. However, in the given statement, no <PR> is provided other than the reason itself.

6. **Classify the Argument Using Defective Argument Types:**
   - Compare the analysis with the known defective argument types to determine which one it fits.

### Application of <IDAA>:

1. **Proposition (<P>):**
   - "One should oppose the senator's proposal to extend government-funded health care to poor minority children."

2. **Reason (<R>):**
   - "because that senator is a liberal Democrat."

3. **Analysis of <R>:**
   - The reason given focuses on the political affiliation of the senator rather than the merit or demerit of the proposal itself.

4. **Evaluate the conclusiveness of <R> for <P>:**
   - The political affiliation of the senator does not provide a logically valid basis to oppose the specific health care proposal. It does not address any direct flaws or benefits of the proposal itself.

5. **Additional Arguments (<PR>):**
   - No additional corroborative arguments are provided in this statement.

6. **Classification of Argument:**
   - This argument falls into the defective argument type <IR> (Inconclusive Reason), as the reason "because that senator is a liberal Democrat" does not conclusively demonstrate why one should oppose the health care proposal. The reason given is not pertinent to the proposal's validity but focuses instead on an irrelevant characteristic of the senator.

### Conclusion:

Based on the guidelines provided, applying <IDAA> to the statement results in identifying it as a defective argument type <IR> for Inconclusive Reason. This classification is because the reason provided does not logically and conclusively support the proposition.
