Certainly! Let's apply the decomposition process (IDAA) to the classification task (IDA) step by step for the given argument:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (P)
The first part of a complete argument is the Proposition, which is what we aim to prove.

**Proposition (P):**
"Obviously the new professor shows mild to moderate problems in the area of ethics."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (R)
The Reason is the causal basis that supports the Proposition.

**Reason (R):**
"In our psychology department, half of the faculty believe that the new assistant professor shows serious problems in the area of ethics. The other half believe that the new faculty member shows no problems in the area of ethics."

### Step 3: Determine if there is a Proof of Reason (PR)
Proof of Reason corroborates the Reason with additional arguments. In this case, no additional arguments are provided to substantiate the Reason.

**Proof of Reason (PR):**
None in this given argument.

### Step 4: Classify the identified Reason and Proposition
Next, we will classify the argument based on the defective argument types defined â€” <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <WCB>, <RR>, <FU>, <DEP>.

#### Possible classifications:
1. **Generalization (G):** The argument does not seem to be a generalization because it doesn't apply findings from a specific group to the general population.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** There is no enumeration of possibilities being claimed complete.
3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** Reason doesn't conclusively prove the Proposition because the opinion is split, and a middle-ground conclusion does not necessarily follow logically.
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** The causal basis for P is weak because the reasoning simply assumes a middle ground must be correct if there is split opinion among faculty.
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** The Reason is not repeating the Proposition.
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** No claim is made that the belief is universally agreed upon.
7. **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** The argument does not hinge on ambiguous language.

### Step 5: Select the most fitting classification
Based on the deficiencies observed in Steps 3 and 4:
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** seems apt as the Reason doesn't conclusively prove the Proposition.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)** also is relevant since attributing split faculty opinions to a middle-ground ethical problem doesn't have a compelling causal basis.

### Final Classification
Given the reasoning neither conclusively addresses nor compellingly supports the Proposition, this argument most closely fits:

**Inconclusive Reason (IR)**

Thus, the defective argument type is classified as **<IR>**.
