For 
To classify the string "sending M-16s to Syrian rebels inevitably mean boots on the ground in Damascus" as of type <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU> or <DEP> using the process defined as <IDAA>, we will break down the task <t> (i.e., IDA) into specific steps (i.e., D). Here are the decomposed steps:

### Steps for <D> applied to <IDA>

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
   - Determine what is being asserted or claimed.
2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   - Determine the causal basis given for the proposition.
3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>):**
   - Check for additional arguments that corroborate the Reason.
4. **Examine for Generalization (G):**
   - Check if the proposition is based on a specific case not necessarily applicable to all instances, but is applied universally.
5. **Examine for Incomplete Enumeration (FE):**
   - Check if the proposition falsely claims to have all possibilities covered but misses out on some.
6. **Examine for Inconclusive Reason (IR):**
   - Check if the reason does not conclusively support the proposition.
7. **Examine for Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):**
   - Check if the reason is essentially a restatement of the proposition.
8. **Examine for Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):**
   - Check if the causal basis given is not compelling.
9. **Examine for Presumptuous Consensus (FU):**
   - Check if the proof of reason is assumed to be universally accepted but is actually still disputed.
10. **Examine for Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):**
    - Check if the language used can be interpreted in more than one way, leading to ambiguity.

### Application to the given string

#### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (P)
- **P:** "sending M-16s to Syrian rebels inevitably mean boots on the ground in Damascus"

#### Step 2: Identify the Reason (R)
- **R:** Implied causality between sending M-16s and the necessity for boots on the ground.

#### Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason (PR)
- There isn't an explicit PR given in the string.

#### Step 4: Examine for Generalization (G)
- This claim does not appear to be a generalization about specific cases applied universally.

#### Step 5: Examine for Incomplete Enumeration (FE)
- The string does not make a claim about all possible outcomes or factors being covered.

#### Step 6: Examine for Inconclusive Reason (IR)
- The leap from "sending M-16s" to "boots on the ground" implies a necessary consequence, but it is not conclusively demonstrated with evidence.

#### Step 7: Examine for Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)
- The reason ("sending M-16s" leading to "boots on the ground") is not just restating the proposition.

#### Step 8: Examine for Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)
- The causal link between sending M-16s and the need for boots on the ground may be considered weak without additional supporting arguments or evidence.

#### Step 9: Examine for Presumptuous Consensus (FU)
- There is no appeal to a universal consensus here.

#### Step 10: Examine for Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)
- The language in the statement is fairly straightforward and does not appear to have multiple interpretations.

### Conclusion
Based on the steps above, we can classify the string "sending M-16s to Syrian rebels inevitably mean boots on the ground in Damascus" as either <IR> (Inconclusive Reason) or <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis), since the causal basis linking the sending of M-16s to the need for ground troops is not conclusively demonstrated nor sufficiently compelling without further evidence or argumentation. 

For our final categorization, we'll choose:

- **Classification:** <IR> (Inconclusive Reason)
