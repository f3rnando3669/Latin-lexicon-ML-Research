For 
Sure, let's apply the decomposition process <D> to the task of classifying the given string according to the types of defective arguments defined.

**Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)**
In the given string, identify what the speaker intends to prove.
- "The only way to solve this problem is by reinstating the death penalty."

**Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)**
Identify the causal basis that is being given to support the Proposition.
- The increase in crimes of theft and robbery due to people becoming hungry and desperate in a global recession.

**Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>)**
Determine if there is any additional argument or evidence supporting the Reason.
- In this specific string, there is no additional argument or proof explicitly supporting the Reason provided.

**Step 4: Compare Proposition, Reason, and Proof of Reason against definitions of defective arguments**
We need to see if any of these components fall into the types of defective arguments:

1. **Generalization (<G>)**
   - Are we seeing an assumption that theft and robbery will be universally resolved by the death penalty, based on perhaps some limited evidence?
   - Yes, there's a generalization because it is not necessarily applicable to all crimes or scenarios.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**
   - Is the speaker claiming that reinstating the death penalty is the complete solution without considering other possibilities? 
   - Yes, the statement claims "the only way" while ignoring other potential solutions to the problem of increasing crime rates.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**
   - Does the given Reason (increase in theft and robbery due to hunger and desperation) conclusively demonstrate that the death penalty is the correct solution?
   - No, an increase in theft and robbery due to hunger and desperation does not conclusively lead to the reinstatement of the death penalty as the most suitable or effective solution.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**
   - Is the causal basis weak, meaning that the Reason given is not compelling enough to justify the Proposition?
   - Yes, the reason given (the increase in theft and robbery) is insufficient to justify the reinstatement of the death penalty because it doesn't directly connect to why the death penalty would address the root issues of hunger and desperation.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**
   - Does the Reason merely repeat the Proposition without adding new information?
   - No, the Reason provides additional context about the global recession and associated increase in crime.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**
   - Is there an assumption that the Proof of Reason is universally agreed upon without dispute?
   - The string does not provide any universal consensus as part of its Proof of Reason.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**
   - Is there any ambiguous language that can be taken in another sense than the speaker intended?
   - Thereâ€™s no apparent ambiguous language within the scope of this string.

**Step 5: Determine the Most Suitable Classification**
Given the above analysis, the given argument can be classified under multiple defective arguments. However, the most prominent classifications would be:

- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: Because it claims reinstating the death penalty as "the only way" without acknowledging alternative solutions.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: Because the Reason provided (increase in crime due to desperation) is insufficient to justify the Proposition (reinstating the death penalty).

**Conclusion:**
The argument "There is a global recession and more people are becoming hungry and desperate. Crimes of theft and robbery have been increasing at an alarming rate lately. The only way to solve this problem is by reinstating the death penalty" is primarily classified as an Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>) and Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>).
