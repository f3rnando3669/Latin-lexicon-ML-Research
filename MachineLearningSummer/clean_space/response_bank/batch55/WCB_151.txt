To apply the IDAA (Decomposition of the task IDA into specific steps) to the passage "Lolita: Since about half the people in the world are female, the chances of the next person to walk out that door being female is about 50/50.
Celina: Do you realize that is the door to Dr. Vulvastein, the gynecologist?", we will follow a structured approach. We need to:

1. **Understand the Passage**: We need to parse and understand the argument being made.
2. **Identify the Proposition <P>**: Find the main assertion being made.
3. **Identify the Reason <R>**: Determine the causal basis or reason given for the proposition.
4. **Evaluate the Argument**: Assess whether any of the defective argument types are present based on the definitions.

Let's execute these steps systematically.

### Step 1: Understand the Passage
Lolita makes an argument about the probability of the next person to walk out of a specific door being female. Celina counters with a context-specific fact: it is the door to a gynecologist's office.

### Step 2: Identify the Proposition <P>
Proposition <P>: "The chances of the next person to walk out that door being female is about 50/50."

### Step 3: Identify the Reason <R>
Reason <R>: "Since about half the people in the world are female."

### Step 4: Evaluate the Argument
Now we need to determine if the argument fits any of the defective argument types <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>.

- **Generalization (G)**: This argument involves making a broad assertion (about the probability of the gender of the next person to walk out the door) based on general population statistics.
    - Analysis: The probability Lolita refers to is based on a generalization about the global population rather than the specific context of people exiting a gynecologist's office.
    - Verdict: Fits the defect Generalization (<G>).

- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: Misses out on pertinent possibilities.
    - Analysis: N/A in this case because enumeration as such is not involved.

- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: Reason does not conclusively support the proposition.
    - Analysis: The reason given (global population stats) does not necessarily apply to the specific scenario (gynecologist's office).
    - Verdict: Also fits IR.

- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: Reason is not compelling.
    - Analysis: The basis for the probability is insufficient in this specific context.
    - Verdict: Could also fit WCB.

- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: Reason repeats proposition.
    - Analysis: N/A in this case; the reason and proposition arenâ€™t repeating each other verbatim.

- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: Assuming universal agreement.
    - Analysis: N/A, as universal agreement is not claimed.

- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: Ambiguity in the sense.
    - Analysis: N/A; language doesn't appear ambiguous in context.

### Conclusion
The passage "Lolita: Since about half the people in the world are female, the chances of the next person to walk out that door being female is about 50/50. Celina: Do you realize that is the door to Dr. Vulvastein, the gynecologist?" primarily contains a defective **Generalization (G)** as Lolita is applying generalized population statistics to a very specific and context-sensitive scenario. It also demonstrates **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** and **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)** because the rationale provided doesn't hold up well when applied to the specific context. 

Thus, the argument can be classified as having defects of type **<G>, <IR>, and <WCB>**.
