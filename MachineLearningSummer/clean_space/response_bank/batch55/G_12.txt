For 
To apply the decomposition strategy \( <IDAA> \) to the given task \( <IDA> \), it involves breaking down the task of classifying the string \( <s> \) into specific steps. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

### Step 1: Understand the Proposition (\( P \))
Identify the Proposition (\( P \)) in the statement. The Proposition is what is being asserted or intended to be proved.

**Proposition (\( P \))**: "The building is closed."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (\( R \))
Determine the Reason (\( R \)) that is given to establish the truth of the Proposition.

**Reason (\( R \))**: "I saw 2 people standing outside the door."

### Step 3: Analyze the Reason (\( R \))
Assess whether the Reason (\( R \)) provides sufficient causal support for the Proposition (\( P \)). Consider all provided definitions of defective argument types \( <G> \), \( <FE> \), \( <IR> \), \( <WCB> \), \( <RR> \), \( <FU> \), and \( <DEP> \):

- **Generalization (\( <G> \))**: Does the argument incorrectly generalize from a few instances?
  - Maybe. Seeing 2 people standing outside doesn't necessarily prove that the entire building is closed.

- **Incomplete Enumeration (\( <FE> \))**: Does the argument claim to have considered all possibilities but actually misses pertinent ones?
  - Not directly applicable. The argument doesn't enumerate possibilities but could be missing some relevant factors.

- **Inconclusive Reason (\( <IR> \))**: Does the Reason fail to conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the \\(\( P \))?
  - Yes. Seeing 2 people outside doesn't conclusively prove that the building is closed.

- **Insufficient Causal Basis (\( <WCB> \))**: Is the cause for \( P \) weak or not compelling?
  - Yes. The reason given (2 people standing outside) is not a compelling causal basis for the conclusion that the building is closed.

- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (\( <RR> \))**: Is the Reason just a repetition of the Proposition?
  - No. The Reason provides different information than the Proposition though it remains weak.

- **Presumptuous Consensus (\( <FU> \))**: Is the Proof of Reason assumed as certain based on a supposed universal consensus?
  - No. The argument does not depend on presumptuous consensus.

- **Ambiguous Language Use (\( <DEP> \))**: Is the Proof of Reason ambiguous and can be interpreted differently?
  - Possibly, but not strongly in this case. The ambiguity isn't the main flaw here.

### Step 4: Determine the Defective Argument Type
Based on the detailed analysis of the Reason (\( R \)) in relation to the Proposition (\( P \)), identify which defective argument type best describes the logical fallacy in the given statement.

**Conclusion**: The provided Reason (\( R \)) does not conclusively prove the Proposition (\( P \)). Thus, the defective argument type here is primarily:

- **Inconclusive Reason (\( <IR> \))**
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (\( <WCB> \))**

### Final Classification
The statement "The building is closed. I saw 2 people standing outside the door." exhibits the logical fallacies of both **Inconclusive Reason (\( <IR> \))** and **Insufficient Causal Basis (\( <WCB> \))** with a primary focus on it being \( IR \).
