For 
To apply <IDAA> (the application of decomposition to the task of identifying defective arguments) to the given string, "An environmental group illegally blocked loggers and workers at a nuclear plant. Therefore, environmentalists are radicals who take the law into their own hands," we will follow these steps:

1. **Identify and Define Proposition (<P>)**: 
   - The proposition is the claim or assertion being made. In this case, the proposition is: **"Environmentalists are radicals who take the law into their own hands."**

2. **Identify and Define Reason (<R>)**:
   - The reason provides the causal basis for the proposition. Here, the reason provided is: **"An environmental group illegally blocked loggers and workers at a nuclear plant."**

3. **Decompose the Proposition (<P>) and Reason (<R>)**:
    -  **Proposition (<P>)**: "Environmentalists are radicals who take the law into their own hands." This is a general statement about all environmentalists.
    -  **Reason (<R>)**: "An environmental group illegally blocked loggers and workers at a nuclear plant." This specifies the action of a particular environmental group.

4. **Evaluate the Proposition and Reason Against Each Defective Argument Type**:
    - **Generalization (<G>)**: The proposition makes a broad assertion about all environmentalists based on the actions of some members of a single environmental group. This suggests a type <G> (Generalization) defective argument because it unjustly extends the behavior of one part to the whole group.
    - **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: This is not an Incomplete Enumeration as it doesn’t attempt to cover all possibilities.
    - **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The reason does not provide conclusive evidence for the proposition. However, <IR> focuses more on the strength of evidence rather than the generalization aspect.
    - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: The reason isn’t a mere repetition of the proposition.
    - **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: This could also apply, as the causal link between the action of a group and the conclusion about all environmentalists is weak and not compelling.
    - **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: The argument does not assume consensus or otherwise appeal to universal agreement.
    - **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**: There does not seem to be ambiguity in language usage here.

5. **Classify the String**:
    - Given the above evaluation, the most suitable classification for the argument "An environmental group illegally blocked loggers and workers at a nuclear plant. Therefore, environmentalists are radicals who take the law into their own hands" is primarily:
        - **Generalization (<G>)**: The argument makes a broad, unjustified generalization about all environmentalists based on the actions of one group.
    - Secondarily, it can be:
        - **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The causal link proposed is weak and not compelling enough to support the proposition.

**Final Classification**: <G> and <WCB> (primarily <G>)

Thus, the string "An environmental group illegally blocked loggers and workers at a nuclear plant. Therefore, environmentalists are radicals who take the law into their own hands" is primarily identified as a <G> type defective argument and secondarily as a <WCB> defective argument.
