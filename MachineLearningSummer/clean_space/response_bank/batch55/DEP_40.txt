Sure, let's break down the task of classifying the given string using the decomposition method. Here's the string we need to analyze:

"It is said that we have a good understanding of our universe. Therefore, we know exactly how it began and exactly when."

### Step-by-Step Decomposition

1. **Identify Key Components**:
   - Proposition (<P>): "We know exactly how it began and exactly when."
   - Reason (<R>): Often inferred, might be "we have a good understanding of our universe."
   - Proof of Reason (<PR>): Not explicitly stated, but implicit understanding based on consensus or scientific agreement.

2. **Check for Defective Argument Types**:
   - **Generalization (<G>)**: Is there an assertion based on incomplete evidence? 
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: Are we missing some possibilities?
   - **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: Does the reason fail to conclusively prove the proposition?
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: Is the causal basis weak?
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: Is the reason merely a restatement of the proposition?
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: Is the proof assumed based on universal agreement?
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**: Is there ambiguous language that could mislead?

3. **Analyze the String Against Defective Argument Types**:

   - **Generalization (<G>)**: The assertion "we know exactly how it began and exactly when" could be a generalization based on the incomplete understanding of the universe.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: Not applicable, because the argument doesnâ€™t list out possibilities.
   - **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The reason "we have a good understanding" does not conclusively prove "we know exactly how it began and exactly when." There's a logical gap between having a good understanding and knowing exact details.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The basis "we have a good understanding" is not compelling enough to support the detailed claim of exact knowledge.
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: Not applicable in this case.
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: The assertion is somewhat implied to be true because "it is said," which presumes a consensus without proof.
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**: Ambiguity could lie in "good understanding" which is subjective, but primary focus should be on logical defects.

4. **Determine the Defective Type**:
   - The most fitting defective argument type here is **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**, as the reason provided ("we have a good understanding of our universe") does not conclusively prove the proposition ("we know exactly how it began and exactly when").

### Conclusion

By breaking down the string and analyzing it step-by-step against the types of defective arguments, we can classify the given string as type:

**<IR> Inconclusive Reason**
