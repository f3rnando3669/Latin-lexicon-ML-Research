For 
To apply the advanced task IDAA (the application of decomposing the task of classifying a string as a defective argument into specific steps) to the given string "Is your stupidity inborn?", we will break down the task of identifying the type of defective argument in a methodical way.

Here's the breakdown:

1. **Understand the String**: We need to comprehend what the string "Is your stupidity inborn?" is stating or implying.

    - This is a question, specifically an ad hominem attack.
    - It implies that the person being addressed is inherently stupid.

2. **Identify Possible Propositions (P)**: Determine what proposition (if any) is being put forward.

    - Potential Proposition (P): "Your stupidity is inborn."

3. **Identify the Reason (R)**: Determine the reason (if any) given for the proposition.

    - Since it is a question, it doesn't explicitly provide a reason. However, the implication might be that the personâ€™s actions or behavior suggest an inherent trait.

4. **Identify Proof of Reason (PR)**: Look for any proof or supporting arguments.

    - There is no proof provided in the question. The question itself is rhetorical and doesn't offer evidence.

5. **Check for Defective Argument Types**: Evaluate the string against the definitions of the defective argument types:
    - **Generalization (G)**: This isn't a generalization; it's a direct personal attack.
    - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: No enumeration is being attempted.
    - **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: There isn't a specific reason being mentioned.
    - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: There's no causal basis suggested.
    - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: The statement doesn't repeat the proposition and reason identically.
    - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: The string doesn't rely on assumed universal agreement.
    - **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: The language use is more insulting than ambiguous, but there's a potential for ambiguity in interpreting what aspect of behavior indicates "stupidity."

6. **Classify the Defective Argument**:
    - On deeper inspection, we notice it lacks evidence and puts forward a loaded question. Its main issue is **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**, because it implies a cause (inborn stupidity) without any supporting evidence or reasoning.
    - Another possible classification could be **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**, since the term "stupidity" could be ambiguous and taken in another sense (inborn vs acquired).

Conclusion:
After decomposing the task and examining each part, we classify "Is your stupidity inborn?" primarily as **WCB (Insufficient Causal Basis)** because it lacks evidence supporting the proposition. Additionally, **DEP (Ambiguous Language Use)** could apply due to the inherent ambiguity in the term "stupidity."

Thus, the string "Is your stupidity inborn?" is classified as primarily WCB and possibly DEP.
