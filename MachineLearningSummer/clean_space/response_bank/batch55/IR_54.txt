To apply the decomposition of the task (IDA) into specific steps (D), we need to carefully break down the process of identifying which type of defective argument the given string represents. Here's how we can proceed step-by-step:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition of IDA:
1. **Identify the Proposition (P):** Determine the main claim or assertion being made.
2. **Identify the Reason (R):** Determine the causal basis or reasoning provided to support the proposition.
3. **Check if Proposition (P) and Reason (R) are Clear and Distinct:** Ensure that the proposition and reason are not merely restating each other.
4. **Evaluate the Completeness of the Enumeration (If Present):** If there's an enumeration or listing of possibilities, check if it's complete.
5. **Check for Generalization (G):** See if the proposition is making a sweeping claim based on insufficient evidence.
6. **Check for Irrelevant or Inconclusive Reason (IR):** Evaluate if the reason provided actually supports the proposition conclusively.
7. **Check for Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** Confirm if the reason is simply a restatement of the proposition.
8. **Check for Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** Ensure the reason provides a compelling causal basis for the proposition.
9. **Check for Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** Look for assertions assumed to be universally accepted without proper evidence.
10. **Check for Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** Evaluate the language for any ambiguity that might lead to different interpretations.

### Applying IDAA to the Given String:
Given string: "Only fools are out in public right now. Careful people are staying home."

1. **Identify the Proposition (P):**
   - **P1:** "Only fools are out in public right now."
   - **P2:** "Careful people are staying home."

2. **Identify the Reason (R):**
   - The reason implied for P1 is that careful people are staying home (R1: positioning "careful" as the opposite of "fools").
   - Similarly, the reason implied for P2 is that only fools are out in public (R2).

3. **Check if Proposition (P) and Reason (R) are Clear and Distinct:**
   - P1 and R2 are closely tied to each other, and P2 and R1 are in a similar situation.
   - The reasoning for each proposition primarily relies on setting the two types of people against each other.

4. **Evaluate the Completeness of the Enumeration:**
   - The string divides people into only two categories: "fools" and "careful people". This enumeration is overly simplistic and ignores any other categories or factors that could exist.

5. **Check for Generalization (G):**
   - The proposition "Only fools are out in public right now" is a sweeping generalization that labels everyone out in public as fools, without evidence that this applies universally to all.

6. **Check for Irrelevant or Inconclusive Reason (IR):**
   - The reasoning linking carefulness strictly to staying home and foolishness strictly to going out is neither well-supported nor conclusive. This is also an example of an Inconclusive Reason.

7. **Check for Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):**
   - The reasons provided ("Careful people are staying home") are not direct repetitions but rather flipsides of the propositions, hence creating an either/or fallacy rather than a repetition.

8. **Check for Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):**
   - Yes, R1 and R2 provide weak justification. The link between carefulness and staying home, and foolishness and going out, lacks a compelling causal basis.

9. **Check for Presumptuous Consensus (FU):**
   - There’s an implicit assumption that everyone agrees on what constitutes "foolish" or "careful behavior".

10. **Check for Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):**
   - The terms “fools” and “careful people” can be interpreted ambiguously, and different individuals may have different understandings of these terms.

### Conclusion
The defective argument type in the given string:
- **Generalization (G):** The primary defect is a sweeping generalization by labeling all people out in public as "fools".
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** The reasons provided are not conclusive, as they rely on binary classification without sufficient evidence, which leads to poor reasoning.
- **Potential Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** The reasoning weakly links the state of being careful or foolish directly to the action of staying home or going out, without a compelling causal relationship.

Thus, the string "Only fools are out in public right now. Careful people are staying home." primarily exhibits defective argument types of **Generalization (G)** and **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** and potentially **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**.
