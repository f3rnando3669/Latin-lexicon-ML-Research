For 
To apply IDAA (decomposition of the task of classifying a string into specific steps) to the task of classifying the given string "The Church used to claim that giving 10% of your income to the Church will free a child’s soul from Limbo into Heaven, so clearly giving money to the Church is a scam!" as one of the defective argument types (G, FE, IR, RR, WCB, FU, DEP), we can proceed step by step as follows:

1. **Break down the string into Proposition (P) and Reason (R):**
   - **Proposition (P):** "giving money to the Church is a scam"
   - **Reason (R):** "The Church used to claim that giving 10% of your income to the Church will free a child’s soul from Limbo into Heaven"

2. **Identify the Proof of Reason (PR), if any, in the argument:**
   - It's not explicitly stated in the string, but it could be implied that the historical claim of the Church serves as the proof or evidence to support the Reason.

3. **Match the Proposition (P), Reason (R), and Proof of Reason (PR) to corresponding definitions of defective arguments:**
   - **G (Generalization):** This argument is not making a claim about a part being applicable to all but rather makes a historical claim about the Church's statements.
   - **FE (Incomplete Enumeration):** This argument does not enumerate possibilities or outcomes regarding giving money to the Church.
   - **IR (Inconclusive Reason):** This needs careful consideration—the given Reason does not directly or conclusively establish that "giving money to the Church is a scam". The claim is based on an interpretation that the historical actions of the Church are representative of current practices.
   - **RR (Faulty Repetition of Proposition):** The Reason does not simply repeat the Proposition.
   - **WCB (Insufficient Causal Basis):** The Reason (R) "The Church used to claim XYZ" may be seen as not a compelling causal basis for claiming that "giving money to the Church is a scam" today. This makes it seem plausible for WCB.
   - **FU (Presumptuous Consensus):** The argument does not mention "universal agreement" or consensus.
   - **DEP (Ambiguous Language Use):** The argument does not seem to rely on ambiguous language in its PR.

4. **Classify the argument:**
   - Based on the above steps, the most fitting defective argument type appears to be **WCB (Insufficient Causal Basis)**. The reason provided is historical and may not be compelling enough to support the assertion that "giving money to the Church is a scam" as it does not conclusively demonstrate this claim and relies on a past practice.

**Conclusion:** The given argument "The Church used to claim that giving 10% of your income to the Church will free a child’s soul from Limbo into Heaven, so clearly giving money to the Church is a scam!" is best classified as an example of **WCB (Insufficient Causal Basis)**.
