For 
To apply <IDAA> to the string "This guy in my class with glasses always talks in class so all guys with glasses are talkative," we need to decompose the task of classifying this argument into specific steps and then apply those steps systematically.

**Step 1: Identify the Proposition <P>**
The <P> in this argument seems to be: "all guys with glasses are talkative."

**Step 2: Identify the Reason <R>**
The <R> given to support the <P> appears to be: "This guy in my class with glasses always talks in class."

**Step 3: Identify the type of defective argument**
We now need to examine the nature of the connection between the <P> and <R> to identify any defects. Here are the types of defected arguments to consider:
- **Generalization (<G>)**: The argument makes a broad statement based on limited evidence.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: The argument claims completeness but misses pertinent possibilities.
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The reason provided does not conclusively support the proposition.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The reason provides a weak causal basis for the proposition.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: The reason repeats the proposition without adding new information.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: The argument assumes universal agreement on something disputed.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**: The argument uses ambiguous language that could lead to misinterpretation.

**Step 4: Compare the argument against defects**
The argument claims that because one individual with glasses is talkative, all individuals with glasses are talkative. This reasoning is based on:
- Making a general statement about a whole group based on the behavior of a single member of that group.

This aligns with the definition of **Generalization (<G>)**, where the <P> is an assertion based on some one part or on a majority of individuals, but not necessarily applicable to all, is referred to all.

**Conclusion:**
The argument "This guy in my class with glasses always talks in class so all guys with glasses are talkative" is a defective argument type classified as **Generalization (<G>)**.

So, the application of <IDAA> to the string classifies the argument as <G>.
