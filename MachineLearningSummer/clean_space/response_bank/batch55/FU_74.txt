Sure, let's apply the defined advanced task of decomposing the task into specific steps and then applying it to classify the argument type of the given string. Here are the steps:

### Step 1: Understanding the Assertion
- Identify the main proposition (\<P\>).
- Summarize what is being claimed or intended to be proved.

### Step 2: Identifying the Causal Basis
- Identify the reason (\<R\>) given to support the proposition.
- Analyze if the reason is clearly stated and directly supports the main proposition.

### Step 3: Evaluating the Proof of Reason
- Check for any additional arguments (\<PR\>) that are used to corroborate the reason (\<R\>).
- Determine if these additional arguments substantiate the reason effectively.

### Step 4: Detecting Defective Arguments
- Determine whether the argument falls into any of the defective types:
  - **Generalization (\<G\>)**: Does the proposition overly generalize from a limited sample?
  - **Incomplete Enumeration (\<FE\>)**: Does the proposition claim completeness but miss possibilities?
  - **Inconclusive Reason (\<IR\>)**: Does the reason not conclusively support the proposition?
  - **Insufficient Causal Basis (\<WCB\>)**: Is the causal basis weak or uncompelling?
  - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (\<RR\>)**: Does the reason merely repeat the proposition?
  - **Presumptuous Consensus (\<FU\>)**: Does it incorrectly assume consensus where there isn't any?
  - **Ambiguous Language Use (\<DEP\>)**: Is there ambiguity in the language that could mislead?

Now, let's apply these steps to classify the argument:

### Step 1: Understanding the Assertion
- **Proposition (\<P\>)**: "Everyone wearing new llama wool coats makes them warm."
  - Here, it is claimed that the action of wearing new llama wool coats will result in warmth for everyone.

### Step 2: Identifying the Causal Basis
- **Reason (\<R\>)**: The reason behind the proposition is implicitly that llama wool coats have inherent properties that make them warm.
  - This implies that the warmth is a result of the material of the coats.

### Step 3: Evaluating the Proof of Reason
- **Proof of Reason (\<PR\>)**: There is no additional argument provided in the statement to further substantiate the claimed reason.

### Step 4: Detecting Defective Arguments

- **Generalization (\<G\>)**: The argument appears to generalize that because some people find llama wool coats warm, everyone will, which isn't necessarily applicable to all individuals without considering personal differences such as different metabolism rates, climate conditions, etc.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (\<FE\>)**: The claim does not enumerate any specific conditions or exceptions, potentially missing pertinent factors.
- **Inconclusive Reason (\<IR\>)**: The implicit reason (that llama wool makes the coat warm) does not conclusively prove that it will be warm for everyone, irrespective of the different possible conditions of use.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (\<WCB\>)**: There is no detailed causal basis provided that thoroughly explains why llama wool will make everyone warm without exceptions.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (\<RR\>)**: The statement does not seem to repeat itself; rather, it forms a conclusion that llama wool will make coats warm.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (\<FU\>)**: The statement does not claim universal agreement; it asserts the point directly.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (\<DEP\>)**: The language is not exactly ambiguous but makes a direct unfounded claim.

Considering the analysis, the identified defective argument types applicable are:

- **Generalization (\<G\>)**
- **Incomplete Enumeration (\<FE\>)**
- **Inconclusive Reason (\<IR\>)**
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (\<WCB\>)**

Conclusively, the given statement "AttP 9: everyone wearing new llama wool coats makes them warm" can be classified primarily as <G> (Generalization), but it also exhibits traits of <FE>, <IR>, and <WCB>.
