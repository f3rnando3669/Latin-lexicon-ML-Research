For 
To apply IDAA (the decomposition of a task into specific steps) to the task of classifying the argument "President Clinton being a moral man, being married and loving his daughter; talking about the Bible; going to church" into one of the defective argument types (G, FE, IR, WCB, RR, FU, DEP), we can break it down into the following steps:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (P)
Examine the given string to determine the proposition, what is being asserted or intended to be proven.

- **Proposition (P)**: "President Clinton is a moral man"

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (R)
Identify the part of the argument that provides the causal basis for the proposition.

- **Reason (R)**: "He is married, loves his daughter, talks about the Bible, and goes to church."

### Step 3: Determine if the Argument is Defective
Evaluate the identified components (P and R) to see if they fall into any of the defective argument types (G, FE, IR, WCB, RR, FU, DEP).

#### Step 3a: Check for Generalization (G)
Consider whether the proposition is an assertion based on a part or majority but not necessarily applicable to all cases.
- In this case, no generalization based on parts or the majority is evident.

#### Step 3b: Check for Incomplete Enumeration (FE)
Determine if the argument makes a claim of complete enumeration of possibilities but misses pertinent ones.
- Not applicable here as the argument does not enumerate possibilities.

#### Step 3c: Check for Inconclusive Reason (IR)
Assess whether the reason provided does not conclusively support the proposition.
- **Analysis**: The reasons given (being married, loving his daughter, talking about the Bible, going to church) do not necessarily demonstrate conclusively that Clinton is a moral man. Morality encompasses more than just these aspects and can include other behaviors and principles not addressed here.
- **Conclusion**: This argument could be an example of IR (Inconclusive Reason).

#### Step 3d: Check for Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)
Analyze if the reason submitted is weak and not compelling for the proposition.
- The reasons provided can be seen as weak because they may not sufficiently substantiate the claim about morality; plenty of other factors contribute to moral character.
- **Consideration**: It overlaps with IR but is slightly different in focus, as WCB concerns the compelling nature of the causal basis itself.

#### Step 3e: Check for Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)
Look to see if the reason is merely a repetition of the proposition.
- The reasons given (married, loving daughter, Bible) are not repetitions of the proposition, so RR is not applicable.

#### Step 3f: Check for Presumptuous Consensus (FU)
Consider if the proof of reason is assumed as certain based on universal agreement.
- Not directly applicable, as there's no mention of universal agreement.

#### Step 3g: Check for Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)
Determine if the proof of reason could be taken in another sense than was intended.
- The language seems unambiguous.

### Step 4: Classify the Argument
Based on the preceding analysis, classify the argument into one or more of the given defective argument types.

- **Primary Classification**: IR (Inconclusive Reason)
- **Secondary Consideration**: WCB (Insufficient Causal Basis)

### Conclusion:
After applying the IDAA to the given string, we classify it primarily as an instance of IR (Inconclusive Reason), with a secondary consideration for WCB (Insufficient Causal Basis). The reasons provided do not conclusively support the proposition that President Clinton is a moral man.
