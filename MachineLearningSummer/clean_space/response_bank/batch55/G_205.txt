Sure, let's apply the decomposition of the advanced task IDAA to classify the given argument string:

**Step 1: Understand and Break Down the Argument**
The argument string is: "We think this new MallTime game app will be a success because all little girls like shopping."

- **Proposition (\<P\>):** "We think this new MallTime game app will be a success."
- **Reason (\<R\>):** "because all little girls like shopping."

**Step 2: Evaluate the Reason (\<R\>) for each type of defective argument**
We need to check if the reason (\<R\>) falls under any type of defective argument:

1. **Generalization (\<G\>):** 
   - Here, the reason states that "all little girls like shopping." This is a sweeping generalization, as it assumes that a characteristic of a group (liking shopping) applies to every member (all little girls).
   - **Conclusion:** Potentially \<G\>.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (\<FE\>):** 
   - This involves claiming completeness without considering all possibilities. Not applicable here, as the argument does not attempt to enumerate possibilities.
   - **Conclusion:** Not \<FE\>.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (\<IR\>):** 
   - This means the reason does not conclusively prove the proposition. Stating "all little girls like shopping" does not conclusively lead to the success of a game app; additional factors are not considered.
   - **Conclusion:** Potentially \<IR\>.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (\<WCB\>):** 
   - This checks if the causal basis is weak. The causal basis (all little girls like shopping) might be weak because there are other factors affecting the game's success.
   - **Conclusion:** Potentially \<WCB\>.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (\<RR\>):** 
   - This is when the reason repeats the proposition. Not applicable here, as there's no repetition.
   - **Conclusion:** Not \<RR\>.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (\<FU\>):** 
   - Assumes certainty based on consensus. Again, not applicable as the argument doesn't imply universal agreement on the matter.
   - **Conclusion:** Not \<FU\>.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (\<DEP\>):** 
   - This involves ambiguity in the proof of reason. Not applicable because the reason is quite unequivocal.
   - **Conclusion:** Not \<DEP\>.

**Step 3: Determine the Strongest Classification**
Considering the points discussed:

- It appears to be a **Generalization (\<G\>)**, because it broadly assumes that all little girls have the same preference.
- It also has elements of **Inconclusive Reason (\<IR\>)** because liking shopping doesn’t necessarily equate to the game app’s success.
- Additionally, it can be classified under **Insufficient Causal Basis (\<WCB\>)** since liking shopping is not a compelling basis for ensuring the game's success.

**Step 4: Conclude the IDA**
Out of the considered types, the most prominent classification for the given argument string "We think this new MallTime game app will be a success because all little girls like shopping." is: **\<G\> (Generalization)**.

Thus, the classified type of defective argument for the given string is Generalization (\<G\>).
