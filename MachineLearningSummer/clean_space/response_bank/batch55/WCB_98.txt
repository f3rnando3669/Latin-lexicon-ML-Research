For 
To apply \( <IDAA> \) to the classification task \( <IDA> \) for the string \( "Since event Y followed event X, event Y must have been caused by event X" \), we will decompose \( <IDA> \) into specific steps and then apply them. First, let's define the essential steps for \( <IDA> \):

1. **Identify the Proposition \( <P> \)**: Determine what is being asserted or concluded.
2. **Identify the Reason \( <R> \)**: Determine the causal basis or reasoning supporting \( <P> \).
3. **Identify the Proof of Reason \( <PR> \)**: Determine if there is any additional argument or proof provided for \( <R> \).
4. **Classify the argument**: Use the identified defective argument types (\( <G> \), \( <FE> \), \( <IR> \), \( <RR> \), \( <WCB> \), \( <FU> \), or \( <DEP> \)) to classify the argument.

Now, let's proceed through these steps for the given string \( "Since event Y followed event X, event Y must have been caused by event X" \):

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition \( <P> \)
The proposition \( <P> \) in this argument is:
- Event Y must have been caused by event X.

### Step 2: Identify the Reason \( <R> \)
The reason \( <R> \) supporting \( <P> \) is:
- Event Y followed event X.

### Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason \( <PR> \)
In this string, there is no additional argument or proof provided beyond the basic reason \( <R> \):
- There is no \( <PR> \) present.

### Step 4: Classify the Argument
Examine the argument for any of the defined defective types:

- **Generalization (\( <G> \)):** Not applicable as it’s not asserting something about a group based on a part.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (\( <FE> \)):** Doesn’t apply, no enumeration is made.
- **Inconclusive Reason (\( <IR> \)):** This could be relevant if the reason does not logically lead to the conclusion.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (\( <WCB> \)):** This seems apt because the reason does not necessarily provide a compelling causal basis.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (\( <RR> \)):** Not applicable, \( <R> \) and \( <P> \) are not the same.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (\( <FU> \)):** Not applicable as it doesn’t mention universal agreement.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (\( <DEP> \)):** Language ambiguity does not seem to be the primary issue here.

This argument is best classified as having an **Insufficient Causal Basis (\( <WCB> \))**. The mere fact that one event follows another does not provide a compelling causal basis to conclude that the first event caused the second.

Therefore, applying \( <IDAA> \) to the provided string indicates that the fallacy described is \( <WCB> \) (Insufficient Causal Basis).
