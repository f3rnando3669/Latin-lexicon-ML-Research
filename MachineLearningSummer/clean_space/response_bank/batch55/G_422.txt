For 
To apply <IDAA> (the application of decomposition to the task of identifying a defective argument) to the given argument "If we let the government ban SUVs, then they're going to want to ban trucks! Then they'll want to ban sports cars! Then they'll want to ban all cars!", we will decompose the task into specific steps to identify which type of defective argument it exemplifies.

**Step 1: Understand the Structure of the Argument**

First, let's break down the argument to identify the proposition <P> and the reasons <R> that support it.

- **Proposition (<P>):** If we let the government ban SUVs, they will eventually want to ban all cars.
- **Reason (<R>):** Banning SUVs will lead to banning trucks, which will lead to banning sports cars, and ultimately to banning all cars.

**Step 2: Evaluate the Argument for Defects**

We need to analyze the argument against each of the defined defective argument types to determine which one fits best.

- **Generalization (<G>):** This type involves applying an assertion based on a part or majority to the whole.
  - The argument does generalize from banning one type of vehicle to banning all vehicles. However, it's more about the progression from one action to all similar actions rather than generalizing from a sample to the whole.

- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** This means claiming a complete enumeration but missing some possibilities.
  - The argument does not enumerate all possibilities but rather follows a sequential progression of actions (SUVs to trucks to sports cars to all cars).

- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** This means the reason does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition.
  - The reasoning here is speculative: it's asserting a slippery slope without strong evidence for each step occurring.

- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** This implies the causal basis submitted for the proposition is not compelling.
  - The argument does imply causality (ban SUVs leads to banning all cars), but the causal links are weak and speculative.

- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** This means the reason is essentially the same as the proposition.
  - Here, the reasons do further explain the progression rather than just repeating the proposition.

- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** This means assuming something is true because it is "universally agreed upon".
  - The argument does not rely on consensus; it relies on speculative causality.

- **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):** This means the proof can be taken in another sense than intended.
  - The language here is clear in its progression and not particularly ambiguous.

**Step 3: Identify the Defective Argument Type**

Considering the evaluation above, the argument most closely fits:

- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** The reasons provided do not conclusively demonstrate that banning SUVs will lead to banning all cars. The argument relies on speculative steps rather than providing solid evidence for each step.

Thus, applying <IDAA> to the given argument, we classify the string as of type <IR> (Inconclusive Reason).
