To apply the process of IDAA (the decomposition of the task of IDA into specific steps) to the given string, we need to classify the argument within the string as one of the defective argument types: Generalization (G), Incomplete Enumeration (FE), Inconclusive Reason (IR), Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB), Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR), Presumptuous Consensus (FU), or Ambiguous Language Use (DEP).

Here are the steps to decompose the classification process:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)
First, we identify the main proposition that the argument intends to prove.

**Proposition (<P>):**
"Therefore, he is bound to want to defend some Catholic traditions and, therefore, cannot be taken seriously."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)
Next, we identify the causal basis or reason given in support of the proposition.

**Reason (<R>):**
"He was born to Catholic parents and raised as a Catholic until his confirmation in 8th grade."

### Step 3: Analyze the Logical Structure
We analyze the logical structure to see if the reason sufficiently supports the proposition. 

### Step 4: Examine for Defective Argument Types
Using the definitions provided, we classify the argument under one of the defective types.

1. **Generalization (G)**
   - The argument does not seem to generalize from a part or majority to all. It focuses on a single individual's background.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**
   - The argument does not claim to enumerate possibilities, so this does not apply either.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**
   - The argument claims that being raised Catholic is a reason for wanting to defend Catholic traditions and thereby should not be taken seriously. This reason does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition as it hinges on assumptions about personal beliefs based solely on upbringing, which is not a conclusive causal link. 

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**
   - The causal basis (raised Catholic until 8th grade) is weak in terms of establishing a deterministic connection to the proposition. This seems applicable.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**
   - The reason given is not a mere repetition of the proposition, so this does not apply.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**
   - The argument does not claim universal agreement as the proof of reason, so this does not apply.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**
   - The language used is not ambiguous in a manner that it can be taken in another sense than intended, so this does not apply.

### Step 5: Conclusion and Classification
Based on the analysis, the argument appears to be a case of **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**. The causal link provided is not compelling enough to support the proposition decisively.

**Classification: WCB (Insufficient Causal Basis)**

Therefore, the given string falls under the defective argument type WCB due to the weak causal basis provided for the proposition.
