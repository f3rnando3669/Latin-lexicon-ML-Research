For 
To apply IDAA to the argument "Lois and Jan did a 'snow dance' one afternoon, and it snowed that night. They claimed to have brought the snow," we need to decompose the task of classifying this argument into specific steps. Hereâ€™s how we can break down the process step by step:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (P)
- **Proposition (P):** "Lois and Jan brought the snow."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (R)
- **Reason (R):** "Lois and Jan did a 'snow dance' one afternoon."

### Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason (PR)
- **Proof of Reason (PR):** "It snowed that night."

### Step 4: Check for Defective Argument Types
- **Generalization (G):** This argument is not generalizing from a sample to a whole population.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** There is no claim of listing all possibilities, so FE does not apply.
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** The reason provided ("Lois and Jan did a 'snow dance'") does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition ("they brought the snow"). The correlation does not imply causation.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** The reason given ("snow dance") is not a compelling causal basis for the proposition. Generally, snow is caused by meteorological factors, not dances.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** The reason doesn't simply restate the proposition.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** There is no assumption of universal agreement here.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** The language does not appear to be intentionally ambiguous.

### Step 5: Classify the Defective Argument
Based on the analysis:
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** The reason does not conclusively demonstrate the proposition.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** The causal basis provided by the reason is not compelling.

### Step 6: Conclusion
The argument "Lois and Jan did a 'snow dance' one afternoon, and it snowed that night. They claimed to have brought the snow" can be classified as:
- **IR:** Inconclusive Reason
- **WCB:** Insufficient Causal Basis

### Final Classification
The string is classified as:
- **<IR>** (Inconclusive Reason)
- **<WCB>** (Insufficient Causal Basis)
