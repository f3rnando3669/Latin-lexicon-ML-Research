To apply the decomposition of the advanced task of classifying the argument to the provided statement, "Everyone is going to get the new smart phone when it comes out this weekend. Why aren’t you?", we first need to break down the task of <IDA> (Identifying Defective Argument) into specific steps. We'll then apply each step systematically to the statement.

### Step-by-Step Application

**Step 1: Identify the Proposition (P)**  
Examine the statement to determine what is being asserted or proposed.  

**Step 2: Identify the Reason (R)**  
Determine the reasoning provided to support the proposition.

**Step 3: Identify any Proof of Reason (PR)**  
Check if there are any further arguments or evidence provided to support the reason given.

**Step 4: Analyze for Generalization (G)**  
See if the proposition is a generalization based on an insufficient sample size.

**Step 5: Analyze for Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**  
Check if the statement claims to cover all possibilities but omits some.

**Step 6: Analyze for Inconclusive Reason (IR)**  
Assess if the reason does not conclusively establish the proposition.

**Step 7: Analyze for Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**  
Examine if the causal basis is weak or not compelling.

**Step 8: Analyze for Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**  
Check if the reason presented is a mere repetition of the proposition.

**Step 9: Analyze for Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**  
Determine if the proof of reason assumes universal agreement on something still in dispute.

**Step 10: Analyze for Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**  
Check if any ambiguity in language alters the intended meaning.

### Application of the Steps

**Step 1: Identify the Proposition (P)**  
"Everyone is going to get the new smart phone when it comes out this weekend."

**Step 2: Identify the Reason (R)**  
While the reason appears implicit, the question "Why aren’t you?" implies a social pressure or consensus as the underlying reason.

**Step 3: Identify any Proof of Reason (PR)**  
There is no explicit further evidence provided to support the reason. The implication relies solely on the assertion of universal behavior.

**Step 4: Analyze for Generalization (G)**  
Examine if the proposition "Everyone is going to get the new smart phone" is a generalization. Yes, it is a generalization because it suggests that an action taken by some will be taken by all, without providing evidence that this is true for the entire population.

**Step 5: Analyze for Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**  
The statement does not claim to enumerate possibilities. Hence, this does not apply.

**Step 6: Analyze for Inconclusive Reason (IR)**  
The reason provided is an implied question "Why aren’t you?" which does not conclusively support the proposition. Hence, it is inconclusive.

**Step 7: Analyze for Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**  
The causal basis here (implied social pressure) is weak. Simply because "everyone" is asserted to be doing something does not provide a compelling reason for another individual to do the same.

**Step 8: Analyze for Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**  
There is no clear repetition of the proposition here.

**Step 9: Analyze for Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**  
The statement assumes universal agreement that everyone will get the phone, which is still in dispute and cannot be assumed as a certainty.

**Step 10: Analyze for Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**  
The language here is not ambiguous; the terms used are clear and specific.

### Conclusion

The statement "Everyone is going to get the new smart phone when it comes out this weekend. Why aren’t you?" primarily exhibits the following defective argument types:

1. **Generalization (G)**: It generalizes the behavior of "everyone" without sufficient evidence.
2. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The question "Why aren’t you?" does not conclusively support the proposition.
3. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: It assumes universal behavior that is still in dispute.

Therefore, the application of <IDAA> identifies that the given statement is of types <G>, <IR>, and <FU>.
