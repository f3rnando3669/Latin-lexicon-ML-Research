To apply IDAA to the given statement, we need to follow a structured approach of decomposing the task of classifying the string according to the defective argument types. 

Step 1: Break down the advanced task (IDA) into specific steps (D).

Step 2: Apply the specific steps to the provided string.

### **Step 1: Decomposition of IDA into Specific Steps**

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):** Determine the central assertion or claim that the argument is making.
2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):** Find the causal basis provided for the proposition.
3. **Evaluate the <R>:** Determine if the reason is valid and sufficient for the proposition.
4. **Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>):** Identify additional arguments that support the reason.
5. **Evaluate the <PR>:** Assess whether the proof of reason is based on sound logic and whether it successfully corroborates the reason.

### **Step 2: Application to the Provided String**

The provided string:
"If I don't get this 5 point assignment done then I will fall behind in my grade and will get backed up so I can't get my other assignment done. Then I will fail the class and turn to a life of crime."

#### **1. Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
   - Proposition: "If I don't get this 5 point assignment done then I will fall behind in my grade."

#### **2. Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   - Reason: "I will get backed up so I can't get my other assignment done."

#### **3. Evaluate the Reason (<R>):**
   - We need to consider whether the reason logically and sufficiently supports the proposition.
   - The reason given is somewhat plausible, but it does not conclusively establish that falling behind in one assignment will necessarily lead to failing the class.

#### **4. Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>):**
   - Proof of Reason: "Then I will fail the class and turn to a life of crime."

#### **5. Evaluate the Proof of Reason (<PR>):**
   - The proof of reason extends the line of reasoning significantly, suggesting drastic consequences that are highly speculative and do not directly support the initial proposition in a concrete way.

### **Classify the Defective Argument**

1. **Generalization (<G>):**
   - The argument generalizes a very specific situation (a 5 point assignment) to highly drastic outcomes.
   
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):**
   - The argument does not consider other possibilities that could prevent the described chain of events, such as getting help on the assignment or finding other ways to make up the grade.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):**
   - The reason does not conclusively demonstrate that failing one assignment will inevitably lead to failing the class.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):**
   - The causal connection between not completing one assignment and failing the class is weak.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):**
   - Not applicable in this case, as the reason presented isn't simply a restatement of the proposition.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):**
   - Not applicable as this argument does not assume anything based on a universal agreement.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):**
   - The language used in the argument ("turn to a life of crime") is extreme and could be seen as ambiguous or hyperbolic.

### **Conclusion**

The primary defective arguments in this string appear to be:

1. **Generalization (<G>)**: The argument extends specific instances to broad, unwarranted conclusions.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: The argument fails to consider other solutions or outcomes.
3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The argumentâ€™s reasoning does not conclusively prove the proposition.
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The causal link presented is not sufficiently compelling.
5. **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**: The severe consequence is presented ambiguously.

Thus, the argument exemplifies multiple defective argument types, predominantly <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <WCB>, and <DEP>.
