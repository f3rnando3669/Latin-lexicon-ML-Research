For 
To apply <IDAA> to the statement "Families communicate less and less in the past forty years since feminism became mainstream. Feminism is to blame for this deterioration in the family," we will decompose the task of classifying this statement into specific steps. Here are the steps we will follow:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)
First, we need to identify the main assertion or proposition being made in the statement.

**Proposition:** "Feminism is to blame for the deterioration in the family communication over the past forty years."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)
Next, we need to look for the causal basis that is provided to support the proposition.

**Reason:** "Families communicate less and less in the past forty years since feminism became mainstream."

### Step 3: Analyze the Proposition and Reason
We need to evaluate whether the given Reason effectively supports the Proposition.

### Step 4: Classify the Reason
We will now classify the Reason according to the specified defective argument types:

1. **Generalization (<G>):** Is the statement making a sweeping generalization? 
   - Yes, it is asserting a causal link based on the majority of individuals' perceptions without necessarily proving it applies to all.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** Does the statement claim a complete enumeration of possibilities but miss pertinent ones?
   - It does not explicitly claim a complete enumeration but could still be seen as neglecting other factors influencing family communication.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** Does the Reason fail to conclusively demonstrate the Proposition?
   - Yes, the Reason does not conclusively demonstrate that feminism is the sole or primary cause of changes in family communication.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** Is the Reason presented weak regarding its causal basis?
   - Yes, the Reason presents a weak causal basis because it oversimplifies a complex social phenomenon.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** Does the Reason merely repeat what the Proposition states?
   - No, the Reason is not exactly the same as the Proposition, although it is closely related.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** Does the Proof of Reason assume consensus without actual proof?
   - The Reason does not rely on presumed consensus.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):** Is the language used in the Reason or Proof ambiguous?
   - Language in the Reason isn't particularly ambiguous.

### Step 5: Determine the Dominant Defective Argument Type(s)
Based on the analysis, we need to decide which defective argument type(s) best categorize the flaws in the argument.

### Conclusion:
- The argument can be mainly classified as a **Generalization (<G>)** because it makes a sweeping claim about feminism's effects without sufficient evidence.
- It also demonstrates **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)** and **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)** because it does not provide a solid causal link proving that feminism is the direct cause of the observed changes in family communication over forty years.

### Summary
Applying <IDAA> to the given statement, we classify it as primarily a **Generalization (<G>)** with elements of **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)** and **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**.
