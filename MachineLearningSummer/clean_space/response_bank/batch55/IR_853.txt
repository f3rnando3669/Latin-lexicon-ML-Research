For 
To apply the decomposition of the task (IDAA) to classify the given string ("Appeals to an authority that has little to nothing to do with the argument") as one of the defective argument types (IDA), we'll break this down into specific steps:

### Step 1: Understand the Task (IDA and IDAA)
- **IDA** is the task of classifying a string as one of the defective argument types: <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>.
- **IDAA** involves the application of decomposition (D) to the task of IDA.

### Step 2: Breakdown (Decomposition: D)
- Decomposition involves the following sub-steps to classify the string:
  1. Identify the nature of the argument being presented.
  2. Determine whether the argument falls into one of the known defective argument types.
  3. Match the details of the argument with the characteristics of each defective type.

### Step 3: Apply Decomposition to the Task

#### Step 3.1: Identify the Nature of the Argument
- **String**: "Appeals to an authority that has little to nothing to do with the argument"
- **Nature**: This statement suggests that the argument relies on an authority figure or an authoritative source to validate its proposition.

#### Step 3.2: Examine Defective Argument Types
- **Generalization (G)**: Assertion based on a part or the majority, not necessarily the whole.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: Claims complete enumeration of possibilities but misses some.
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: Reason does not conclusively support the proposition.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: Weak causal basis for the proposition.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: The reason repeats the proposition without adding value.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: Assumes something is certain based on "universal agreement" for a thing in dispute.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: Proof can be taken differently than intended.

#### Step 3.3: Match Argument with Defective Types
- **Nature** of the string: The argument depends on an authority but that authority has little to no relevance to the topic.
- **Match**:
  - **FU (Presumptuous Consensus)** seems relevant because it often involves using a source of authority in a presumptive manner, specifically believing something to be true because it is "universally agreed upon" or assumed to be correct given the authority figure.
  - However, the defective argument specifically states the authority has **little to no relevance**, which suggests an improper use of authority.

### Step 4: Determine the Most Suitable Defective Type

- **FU** (Presumptuous Consensus) deals with assuming correctness based on perceived universal agreement.
- **WCB** (Insufficient Causal Basis) deals with weak reasoning due to an inappropriate causal link.

Given the argument relies on irrelevant authority:
- It is **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**â€”the reasoning (appeal to authority) is weak because the authority has little to do with the argument, making the causal link weak or inappropriate.

### Step 5: Conclusion
"Appeals to an authority that has little to nothing to do with the argument" matches best with the defective argument type **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**.
