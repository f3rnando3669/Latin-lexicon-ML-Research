For 
To apply <IDAA> to the string "The United States is the wealthiest nation in the world. So every American is wealthy," we need to decompose the task of classifying <s> into specific steps. Hereâ€™s the breakdown process:

1. **Identify the Parts of the Argument:**
   - We first need to identify the proposition (\<P\>) and the reason (\<R\>) presented in the string.

2. **Analyze the Proposition and Reason:**
   - We analyze if there are any proofs of the reason (\<PR\>).
   - We evaluate the validity of the reason (\<R\>) in supporting the proposition (\<P\>).

3. **Classify the Argument as Defective or Not:**
   - Determine if the argument fits any of the defective argument types (\<G\>, \<FE\>, \<IR\>, \<RR\>, \<WCB\>, \<FU\>, or \<DEP\>).

### Step-by-Step Application:

#### Step 1: Identify the Parts of the Argument
In the statement "The United States is the wealthiest nation in the world. So every American is wealthy."

- \<P\>: "Every American is wealthy."
- \<R\>: "The United States is the wealthiest nation in the world."

#### Step 2: Analyze the Proposition and Reason
The statement does not provide additional arguments or evidence to support the reason, so there is no \<PR\> present.

#### Step 3: Classify the Argument as Defective or Not
We need to check if the argument fits into any of the defined defective argument types:

- **Generalization (\<G\>):** This argument applies the wealth status of the nation to every individual within the nation, which may not necessarily be true because the wealth of a nation does not guarantee wealth for every individual in it.

- **Incomplete Enumeration (\<FE\>):** This doesn't seem to deal with the enumeration of possibilities, so it does not fit here.

- **Inconclusive Reason (\<IR\>):** This fits well because the reason provided ("The United States is the wealthiest nation in the world") does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition ("Every American is wealthy"). The wealth of a nation does not directly imply wealth for all its citizens.

- **Insufficient Causal Basis (\<WCB\>):** This could also apply because the causal link between the nation's wealth and the individual's wealth is weak and not compelling.

- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (\<RR\>):** The reason provides new information, so this does not fit.

- **Presumptuous Consensus (\<FU\>):** The argument does not rely on presumed consensus, so this doesn't apply.

- **Ambiguous Language Use (\<DEP\>):** The terms used are clear and not ambiguous, so this type does not apply.

### Conclusion
The argument can be classified as both \<G\> (Generalization) and \<IR\> (Inconclusive Reason):

- **\<G\> (Generalization):** The proposition is based on the national status and not necessarily applicable to all individuals.
- **\<IR\> (Inconclusive Reason):** The reason presented does not conclusively establish the truth of the proposition.

Thus, applying \<IDAA\> to the given string results in identifying the argument as primarily defective in the ways defined by \<G\> and \<IR\>.
