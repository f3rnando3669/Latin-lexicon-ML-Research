For 
To apply <IDAA> (the decomposition of the classification task <IDA> into specific steps) to the string "Have you stopped beating your wife?," we need to break down the task into specific steps to classify the string according to the defective argument types provided: <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, and <DEP>. Here’s how we can approach it step by step:

1. **Understand the Task (<IDA>):** 
   The task is to classify the string as one of the defective argument types.

2. **Break Down the Task (<D>):**
   Decomposition involves:
   - Analyzing the Proposition (<P>)
   - Analyzing the Reason (<R>)
   - Analyzing the Proof of Reason (<PR>)
   - Identifying how the string fits into one of the defective argument types
   
3. **Apply Decomposition to the String:**
   - **Step 1:** Parse the string to understand its components:
     - The string "Have you stopped beating your wife?" assumes the act of beating the wife has taken place, regardless of the response.
   - **Step 2:** Identify the inherent Proposition (<P>):
     - The implicit proposition is: "The person being addressed has been beating their wife."
   - **Step 3:** Evaluate the Reason (<R>):
     - The string doesn't explicitly provide a reason (causal basis) but assumes the act has occurred.
   - **Step 4:** Determine if there’s Proof of Reason (<PR>):
     - There is no proof provided; the string presupposes the act.

4. **Identify the Defective Argument Type:**
   - **Analyze for Generalization (<G>):**
     - Not applicable; the string doesn’t generalize a majority to all.
   - **Analyze for Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):**
     - Not applicable; the string doesn’t enumerate possibilities.
   - **Analyze for Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):**
     - Not applicable directly; there’s no causal reason or argument presented.
   - **Analyze for Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):**
     - Not applicable directly; there’s no causal basis attempted.
   - **Analyze for Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):**
     - Not applicable; there’s no repetition of the proposition.
   - **Analyze for Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):**
     - Not applicable; it doesn’t rely on assumed universal consensus.
   - **Analyze for Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):**
     - Applicable: The question uses ambiguous language, implying guilt regardless of the response.
     - The ambiguity lies in the fact that whether the answer is "yes" or "no," it presupposes the act of beating the wife, which may not be true and can be taken in another sense.

5. **Conclude and Classify:**
   - Based on the steps of decomposition and analysis, "Have you stopped beating your wife?" fits the defective argument type <DEP> (Ambiguous Language Use).

**Conclusion:** The string "Have you stopped beating your wife?" is classified as type <DEP>, due to its inherent ambiguous presupposition.
