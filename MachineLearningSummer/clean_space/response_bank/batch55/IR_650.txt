For 
To apply \( IDAA \) to the string "This technique using vague positive words that actually hold little meaning," we need to decompose the task of classifying it as one of the defective argument types (\( IDA \)) into specific steps (\( D \)). This involves analyzing the string and identifying which type of defective argument it fits into based on the definitions provided. Here is a step-by-step breakdown (\( D \)):

### Step 1: Understand the Definitions
First, we review the definitions of defective argument types to ensure clarity:

1. **Generalization (\(G\))**: \(P\) is an assertion based on some part or majority but not necessarily applicable to all.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (\(FE\))**: \(P\) claims a complete enumeration but misses pertinent possibilities.
3. **Inconclusive Reason (\(IR\))**: \(R\) does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of \(P\).
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (\(WCB\))**: \(R\) is weak because the causal basis for \(P\) is not compelling.
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (\(RR\))**: \(R\) repeats what was said in \(P\).
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (\(FU\))**: \(PR\) is assumed certain because it is "universally agreed upon," though still in dispute.
7. **Ambiguous Language Use (\(DEP\))**: \(PR\) can be interpreted differently than intended.

### Step 2: Analyze the String
Next, we analyze the string "This technique using vague positive words that actually hold little meaning." to see if it fits any of the defective argument types defined.

- **Identify \(P\)**: The string does not provide a clear proposition but hints at an assertion that some technique uses vague, positive words.
- **Identify \(R\)**: The string suggests that the reason these words hold little meaning is that they are vague and positive.
- **Examine for Vague or Ambiguous Language**: The phrase "vague positive words" and "hold little meaning" implies ambiguity and potential for multiple interpretations.

### Step 3: Classify the String
By correlating our analysis with the defective argument types, we look for the best fit:

- **Generally Applicable \(P\)**: The string broadly suggests that the technique uses vague, positive words, potentially fitting \(G\).
- **Complete Enumeration \(FE\)**: Not applicable as it doesn't enumerate possibilities.
- **Inconclusive Reason \(IR\)**: The reason given ("vague positive words hold little meaning") may fit here, as it does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the implied \(P\).
- **Weak Causal Basis \(WCB\)**: It could also be \(WCB\) as the causal linkage is weak and not compelling.
- **Faulty Repetition \(RR\)**: The \(R\) ("hold little meaning") does not repeat the \(P\) exactly.
- **Presumptuous Consensus \(FU\)**: Not applicable as there is no claim of universal agreement.
- **Ambiguous Language Use \(DEP\)**: Given the discussion of vague, positive words, this could also fit \(DEP\) as the language is inherently ambiguous.

### Step 4: Determine the Best Fit
Finally, we determine the best fit for classification:

- Based on the actual ambiguity highlighted in the language used, \(DEP\) seems to be the best fit.
- \(IR\) and \(WCB\) are potential candidates, but the primary issue revolves around ambiguous language.

### Conclusion
The string "This technique using vague positive words that actually hold little meaning." is best classified as \( DEP \) due to the ambiguity inherent in the used language, which leads to potential misinterpretation or misunderstanding.
