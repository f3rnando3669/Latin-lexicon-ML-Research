To apply the task of decomposing and classifying the provided argument into its defective argument types, we will follow these steps:

### Decomposition Steps (<D>):
1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>)**: Determine the main assertion that the argument is trying to prove.
2. **Identify the Reason (<R>)**: Find the causal basis that supports the Proposition.
3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>)**: Look for additional arguments that further corroborate the Reason.
4. **Classify the Defective Argument Types (<IDA>)**: Check the identified parts of the argument against the definitions of defective argument types to classify them accordingly.

### Step-by-Step Application (<IDAA>):

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
   - Proposition (P): "The use of laptops and other devices to replace books in the classroom would eventually lead to the downfall of printing and publishing companies, causing many people to be laid off from their jobs. As such, schools should stick to using printed books as study materials."

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   - Reason (R): "The use of laptops and other devices to replace books in the classroom would eventually lead to the downfall of printing and publishing companies, causing many people to be laid off from their jobs."

3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>):**
   - In this argument, there isn't explicitly additional corroboration found for the Reason. Typically, one would expect data, more substantial evidence, or additional arguments to support the Reason, but they are absent here.

4. **Classify the Defective Argument Types (<IDA>):**
   - **Generalization (G):** The assertion in the Proposition is broad and makes sweeping assumptions about the impact on all printing and publishing companies without substantiating how universal this outcome would be. This appears to be a Generalization because it applies a single effect (downfall of companies) universally.
   
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** The argument doesn't account for other potential outcomes or possibilities. For example, it ignores digital publishing or evolving new sectors to offset job losses. This omission makes it an Incomplete Enumeration.

   - **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** The Reason doesn't conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the Proposition as it doesn't present direct causal evidence for the chain of events leading from classroom technology use to the downfall of an entire industry and job losses.

   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** The causal basis presented (replacement of books leading to downfall of companies) is weak because it is not a compelling argument without further evidence showing that this shift will directly cause such severe economic consequences.

   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** The Reason does not merely repeat the Proposition; rather, it attempts to provide a causal link, even though it's not sufficiently strong.

   - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** There is no direct assertion that the argument is universally agreed upon, so this type does not apply.

   - **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** There is no indication that the language in the argument is ambiguous or has been taken in another sense than what was intended.

### Classification of the Argument:
Given the examination above, the argument mostly falls under the categories of **Generalization (G)**, **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**, **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**, and **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**. These classifications highlight the primary deficiencies in the argument's structure and support.

Thus, the string "The use of laptops and other devices to replace books in the classroom would eventually lead to the downfall of printing and publishing companies, causing many people to be laid off from their jobs. As such, schools should stick to using printed books as study materials." can be classified as containing defects of types <G>, <FE>, <IR>, and <WCB>.
