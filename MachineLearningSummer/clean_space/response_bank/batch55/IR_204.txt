For 
To apply **IDAA** (the application of decomposing the task of classification) to the string "Personally attacking someone to shift attention away from your views is," we will begin by decomposing the task of classification, **IDA**, into specific steps. Here are the steps we can follow to classify the provided string:

1. **Understand the Proposition (<P>)**:
   - Identify the main proposition or claim within the string.
   - In this case, the proposition seems to be "Personally attacking someone to shift attention away from your views is." We recognize that this statement is incomplete, but it suggests a faulty argumentative technique.

2. **Identify the Type of Defective Argument**:
   - Compare the given string with the definitions of the defective argument types:
     - **Generalization (<G>)**: An assertion based on a part or majority, not necessarily applicable to all.
     - **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: Claiming to have made a complete list but missing some possibilities.
     - **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: Reason does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition.
     - **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: Weak causal basis for the proposition.
     - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: Repeating the proposition as a reason.
     - **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: Assuming a proposition is certain because it is "universally agreed upon."
     - **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**: Using language that can be interpreted in another sense than intended.

3. **Analyze the String Against Each Defective Argument Type**:
   - The string involves "personally attacking someone" which hints at an argumentative tactic that shifts attention rather than addressing the argument itself.
   - This tactic is often called an ad hominem attack in classical terms, which is an attack on the person rather than addressing the argument they are making.

4. **Match with the Most Relevant Defective Argument Type**:
   - Compare the characteristics of the argument type with the argument in the string.
   - The string implies that by personally attacking someone, the attention is shifted away from the argument (views) being made, which doesn't provide a logical reason for dismissing the argument at hand.

5. **Determine the Best Fit**:
   - This scenario fits best with a type where the causal basis or reason is insufficient or not compelling in the context of proving the proposition.
   - In argumentative fallacies, this behavior aligns closely with **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)** where the shift of attention from the audience from the argument to the person does not prove or disprove the 'views' being argued over.

Thus, applying **IDAA** to the string "Personally attacking someone to shift attention away from your views is" leads us to classify it under the defective argument type **<IR>** (Inconclusive Reason).

Explanation:
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The reason given (personal attack) does not demonstrate the correctness or incorrectness of the views. It shifts the argument without addressing the actual views or providing substantial reasoning against them.
