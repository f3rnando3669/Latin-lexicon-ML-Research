For 
To apply IDAA (the decomposition of the task of classifying a defective argument, IDA, into specific steps) to the given argument "Power lines cause cancer. I met a little boy with cancer who lived just 20 miles from a power line who looked into my eyes and said, in his weak voice, 'Please do whatever you can so that other kids won’t have to go through what I am going through.'", we will follow these steps:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (P)
First, identify the Proposition set forth in the argument.

- **Proposition (P)**: "Power lines cause cancer."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (R)
Determine the Reason presented to support the Proposition.

- **Reason (R)**: "I met a little boy with cancer who lived just 20 miles from a power line."

### Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason (PR)
Find any Proof of Reason, i.e., additional arguments corroborating the Reason.

- **Proof of Reason (PR)**: The statement of the little boy: "Please do whatever you can so that other kids won’t have to go through what I am going through."

### Step 4: Assess the Argument for Defects
Analyze the given argument to determine if it fits any of the defective argument types defined (G, FE, IR, RR, WCB, FU, DEP).

- **Generalization (G)**: The claim is made that power lines cause cancer based on a single anecdote (the boy with cancer near a power line), which is not sufficient to generalize to all cases.

### Step 5: Classify the Argument
Classify the argument based on the identified defects.

- The main defect here is that the argument makes a **Generalization (G)**. It uses the single case of a boy living near a power line who has cancer to assert a causal relationship, which is not scientifically or statistically justified.

### Step 6: Verify Completeness and Accuracy
Review all steps to ensure completeness and accuracy in the classification process.

- Proposition: Correctly identified
- Reason: Correctly identified
- Proof of Reason: Correctly identified (although it's more of an emotional appeal than a factual corroboration)
- Defect: Correctly identified as Generalization (G)

### Conclusion
The argument "Power lines cause cancer. I met a little boy with cancer who lived just 20 miles from a power line who looked into my eyes and said, in his weak voice, 'Please do whatever you can so that other kids won’t have to go through what I am going through.'" can be classified as <G> (Generalization).
