To apply IDAA to the given dialogue, we need to decompose the task of classifying the argument into specific steps. Let's break down the process:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition \<P\>
The Proposition is the assertion or claim intended to be proved. 

In the given dialogue, the overarching proposition \<P\> seems to be:
- "They use electrolytes to make Brawndo."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason \<R\>
The Reason sets forth the causal basis for the Proposition.

In the given dialogue, the Reason offered is:
- "Because Brawndo's got electrolytes."

### Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason \<PR\>
The Proof of Reason corroborates the Reason, typically via additional arguments or evidence.

In this case, the Proof of Reason is implicit:
- "Electrolytes are good, hence used in Brawndo."

### Step 4: Determine if the argument is defective and classify if so
Analyze each part (Proposition, Reason, Proof of Reason) to check for any defects.

#### Checking for Defective Argument Types:
1. **Generalization (G):** Does the Proposition apply to all based on some or a majority? 
   - No. The claim is specific to Brawndo.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** Is there a claim of complete enumeration but missing some possibilities?
   - No. There's no enumeration of possibilities.
   
3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** Does the Reason fail to conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the Proposition?
   - Yes. The Reason given ("Because Brawndo's got electrolytes") does not conclusively explain why electrolytes are used. It merely restates the fact without a causal link.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** Is the Reason weak or not compelling?
   - Yes. The Reason ("Because Brawndo's got electrolytes") is weak as it doesn't explain the utility or necessity of electrolytes in Brawndo.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** Does the Reason merely repeat the Proposition without additional support?
   - Yes. The Reason essentially repeats the Proposition.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** Is the Proof of Reason assumed based on universal agreement without actual evidence?
   - No. There is no assertion of universal agreement.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** Can the Proof of Reason be taken in another sense different from what was intended?
   - No. The language in the Proof of Reason is not ambiguous.

### Conclusion
Based on the analysis, the dialogue contains a defective argument primarily characterized by:
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: The Reason repeats the Proposition without providing a causal explanation.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: The Reason given is weak and does not compellingly support the Proposition.

Thus, the dialogue "Pvt. Joe Bowers: What are these electrolytes? Do you even know? Secretary of State: They're... what they use to make Brawndo! Pvt. Joe Bowers: But why do they use them to make Brawndo? Secretary of Defense: [raises hand after a pause] Because Brawndo's got electrolytes." can be classified under:
- **\<RR\>**
- **\<WCB\>**
