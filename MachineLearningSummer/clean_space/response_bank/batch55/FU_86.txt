For 
Let's apply the process of \( \text{IDAA} \) to classify the string "All the popular guys at school are dyeing their hair purple, so you should, too!" step by step. 

First, we will decompose \( \text{IDA} \) into specific steps (\( \text{D} \)) as follows:

1. **Identify the Proposition (\( \text{P} \))**: Determine the main claim or statement that is intended to be proven or established.
2. **Identify the Reason (\( \text{R} \))**: Establish the causal basis that the argument provides to support the Proposition.
3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (\( \text{PR} \))**: Check for any additional arguments that corroborate the Reason.
4. **Classify the Argument**: Determine whether the argument fits one of the defective argument types \( \text{G} \), \( \text{FE} \), \( \text{IR} \), \( \text{RR} \), \( \text{WCB} \), \( \text{FU} \), or \( \text{DEP} \).

Now, let's apply these steps to the given string:

**Step 1: Identify the Proposition (\( \text{P} \))**

The main claim in the argument is: 
- "You should dye your hair purple."

**Step 2: Identify the Reason (\( \text{R} \))**

The causal basis provided to support the Proposition is:
- "All the popular guys at school are dyeing their hair purple."

**Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason (\( \text{PR} \))**

In this argument, there is no further additional argument provided to corroborate the Reason. The statement relies solely on the reason given.

**Step 4: Classify the Argument**

Let's review the defective argument types to identify which one fits:

- \( \text{G} \) (Generalization): Assertion based on some part or majority but not necessarily all.
- \( \text{FE} \) (Incomplete Enumeration): Claim of complete enumeration when it isnâ€™t.
- \( \text{IR} \) (Inconclusive Reason): Reason does not conclusively demonstrate the Proposition.
- \( \text{RR} \) (Faulty Repetition of Proposition): Reason repeats the Proposition.
- \( \text{WCB} \) (Insufficient Causal Basis): Weak causal basis for the Proposition.
- \( \text{FU} \) (Presumptuous Consensus): Assumes universal agreement on something still in dispute.
- \( \text{DEP} \) (Ambiguous Language Use): PR can be taken in another sense.

Analyzing the provided argument:

- The reason ("All the popular guys at school are dyeing their hair purple") suggests a generalization that the behavior of "popular guys" applies to everyone, specifically to the person being addressed.

The argument ultimately relies on the behavior of a specific group (popular guys) to suggest what the addressed person should do, without proving that dyeing one's hair purple is beneficial or relevant for everybody. This fits closely with:

- \( \text{G} \) (Generalization): The proposition is based on the behavior of some (not necessarily all) individuals and applies it to another individual.

Thus, the argument can be classified as:

**Generalization (\( \text{G} \))**

Therefore, applying \( \text{IDAA} \) to the string "All the popular guys at school are dyeing their hair purple, so you should, too!" results in the classification of the argument as a **Generalization (\( \text{G} \))**.
