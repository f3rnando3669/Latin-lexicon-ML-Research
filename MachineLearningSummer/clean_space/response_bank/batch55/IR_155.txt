Sure, let's apply the task of decomposing the task of classifying the statement according to our defective argument types.

### Step-by-step Decomposition (<D>) of the Classification Task (<IDA>):

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>)**:
   - Isolate the primary assertion or claim being made.

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>)**:
   - Look for the causal basis or rationale provided to support the proposition.

3. **Check for Proof of Reason (<PR>)**:
   - Determine if additional arguments or evidence are provided to substantiate the Reason.

4. **Analyze Each Component**:
   - Examine the Proposition (<P>), Reason (<R>), and Proof of Reason (<PR>) in detail based on the given definitions.

5. **Identify Defective Argument Type**:
   - Match the components with the defective argument types (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>) according to their definitions.

6. **Classify the Statement**:
   - Assign the defective argument type to the statement based on the analysis.

### Application of Decomposition (<IDAA>) to the Statement:

**Statement:** "That's what abortion is - killing innocent humans for money. Abortionists are government licensed hit men."

**Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)**:
- Proposition (<P>): "Abortion is killing innocent humans for money."

**Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)**:
- Reason (<R>): Implicitly, the statement suggests that because abortion results in money for the abortionists, it's akin to being hit men.

**Step 3: Check for Proof of Reason (<PR>)**:
- Proof of Reason (<PR>): The statement does not provide additional arguments or evidence—it is asserting a direct correlation without further substantiation.

**Step 4: Analyze Each Component**:
- The Proposition is strong and clear, making a bold claim about abortion.
- The Reason correlates abortion to the actions of hit men, based on financial incentives.
- No additional proof of reason is offered.

**Step 5: Identify Defective Argument Type**:
- **Generalization (<G>)**: The statement simplifies a complex issue by generalizing all abortionists as performing acts motivated solely by financial gain.
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The reason given does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition; it is more of an assertion rather than a compelling causal basis.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: Simply stating that money is involved is not a compelling enough causal basis to equate abortionists to hit men.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: Not applicable in this context since the Reason does not just repeat the Proposition.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: The statement assumes a moral consensus ("abortionists are hit men"), but this is still a highly controversial assertion.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**: The statement’s language is emotionally charged but not ambiguous—it's quite direct.

**Step 6: Classify the Statement**:
- The statement falls under multiple defective argument types: primarily **Generalization (<G>)**, **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**, **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**, and **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**.

Thus, the statement can be classified as primarily a **Generalization (G)** with elements of **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**, **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**, and **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**.
