For 
To apply the decomposition task \(\text{<D>}\) to the classification task \(\text{<IDA>}\) step by step, we need to break down the task of classifying the argument "McDonald’s has served 100 billion people in the world. It must be the best fast food restaurant in the world." 

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (\(\text{<D>}\))

1. **Identify the Proposition (\(\text{<P>}\)):**
   - Determine what the speaker intends to prove.

2. **Identify the Reason (\(\text{<R>}\)):**
   - Determine the causal basis for the proposition.

3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (\(\text{<PR>}\)):**
   - Determine if there are any additional arguments corroborating the reason.

4. **Analyze for Defective Argument Types:**
   - Check for types \(\text{<G>}\) (Generalization), \(\text{<FE>}\) (Incomplete Enumeration), \(\text{<IR>}\) (Inconclusive Reason), \(\text{<WCB>}\) (Insufficient Causal Basis), \(\text{<RR>}\) (Faulty Repetition of Proposition), \(\text{<FU>}\) (Presumptuous Consensus), \(\text{<DEP>}\) (Ambiguous Language Use).

### Application to the Argument

#### 1. **Identify the Proposition (\(<P>\))**
   - "**It must be the best fast food restaurant in the world**."

#### 2. **Identify the Reason (\(<R>\))**
   - "**McDonald’s has served 100 billion people in the world**."

#### 3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (\(<PR>\))**
   - There doesn’t appear to be a further proof provided to support the reason. The reason relies on the provided fact about the number of people served.

#### 4. **Analyze for Defective Argument Types:**
   - **\(<G>\) Generalization**: The argument takes a general fact (number of people served) to make a broad claim (best fast food restaurant). However, this is not quite applicable as it is focused on numerical success rather than a sample to generalize from.
   
   - **\(<FE>\) Incomplete Enumeration**: This type does not match as the argument does not attempt to enumerate possibilities.
   
   - **\(<IR>\) Inconclusive Reason**: This could apply since serving a vast number of people does not conclusively demonstrate that McDonald's is the best by other potential metrics (like quality, healthiness, or taste).
   
   - **\(<WCB>\) Insufficient Causal Basis**: This is a strong candidate. The reason provided (serving 100 billion people) is not a compelling causal basis for the proposition that McDonald’s is the best fast food restaurant since others could argue on different standards such as food quality or service.
   
   - **\(<RR>\) Faulty Repetition of Proposition**: This type does not appear relevant as the reason is not just a repetition of the proposition.
   
   - **\(<FU>\) Presumptuous Consensus**: The argument does not rely on universal agreement, it relies on a statistical measure.
   
   - **\(<DEP>\) Ambiguous Language Use**: There is no ambiguous language in the argument itself.

### Conclusion

After applying \(\text{<IDAA>}\) to the argument step-by-step, it is most accurately classified as an example of \(\text{<WCB>}\) (Insufficient Causal Basis). This is because the causal basis given (number of people served) is insufficient to substantiate the proposition that McDonald's is the best fast food restaurant in the world.
