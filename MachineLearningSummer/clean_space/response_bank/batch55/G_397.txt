For 
To apply <IDAA> to the given statement "My mother has always told me not to drink milk after eating fish because she knows a friend whose skin got patched after drinking milk and eating fish together. Besides, many other people have told me the same thing so it must be true," we need to decompose the task (<IDA>) of classifying the argument into its specific steps (<D>):

### Step-by-Step Decomposition of <IDA> (Task Classification):
1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):** Determine what the argument is attempting to prove or assert.
2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):** Determine the causal basis given for the proposition.
3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>):** Find any additional arguments provided to substantiate the reason.
4. **Classify the Defective Argument Type:** Check if the given argument matches any of the defective argument types (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <WCB>, <RR>, <FU>, <DEP>).

### Application of <IDAA> to the Given Statement:

#### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)

The proposition (<P>) in the statement is:
- "You should not drink milk after eating fish."

#### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)

The reason (<R>) provided is:
- "My mother knows a friend whose skin got patched after drinking milk and eating fish together."

#### Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>)

The proof of reason (<PR>) offered is:
- "Besides, many other people have told me the same thing so it must be true."

#### Step 4: Classify the Defective Argument Type

We then classify the argument based on the given defective types:

1. **Generalization (<G>):**
   - The argument generalizes from a single instance (a friend's skin getting patched) and other peopleâ€™s opinions to a universal rule without sufficient evidence.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):**
   - There's no attempt to enumerate all possibilities; this defect applies if one claims comprehensive coverage but misses pertinent possibilities.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):**
   - The reason provided about the friend's skin reaction does not conclusively demonstrate that drinking milk after eating fish is inherently harmful.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):**
   - The causal basis (a single anecdotal experience) is weak and not compelling evidence for the proposition.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):**
   - The reason should not just be a repetition of the proposition in different words.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):**
   - The claim of truth is based on the idea that "many other people have told me the same thing so it must be true," assuming a consensus where the matter is still in dispute.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):**
   - The argument does not involve ambiguous language.

### Conclusion

The given argument matches the following defective types:
- **Generalization (<G>):** It erroneously generalizes from a single anecdote.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** The causal basis provided is weak and relies on a single anecdote.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** It assumes that because many people say it, it must be true, without solid evidence.

Thus, the argument can be classified as:
- **<G>**, **<WCB>**, and **<FU>**.

This completes our application of <IDAA>.
