For 
To apply \( \text{IDAA} \) to the given string, we first decompose the task of classifying the string into specific steps. Here’s how we can break it down:

1. **Identify the Proposition (\(P\)) and Reason (\(R\)) in the given argument.**
2. **Evaluate whether any Proof of Reason (\(PR\)) exists and its nature if it does.**
3. **Analyze the argument to classify it under defective argument types \(<G>\), \(<FE>\), \(<IR>\), \(<RR>\), \(<WCB>\), \(<FU>\), or \(<DEP>\).**
4. **Summarize the findings to determine the specific defective argument type.**

Let’s apply each step to the string: "When my parents talk to me about how important it is to learn a second language, I remind them they didn't learn another language."

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (\( P \)) and Reason (\( R \))
- **Proposition (\(P\))**: It is important to learn a second language. (Implicit in parents' statement)
- **Reason (\(R\))**: The parents did not learn another language. (Used to counter the importance)

### Step 2: Evaluate if there is any Proof of Reason (\( PR \))
- **Proof of Reason (\(PR\))**: The argument does not provide additional reasons beyond the parents' own experience.

### Step 3: Analyze the Argument for Defective Types \(<G>\), \(<FE>\), \(<IR>\), \(<RR>\), \(<WCB>\), \(<FU>\), or \(<DEP>\)
- **Generalization (\(G\))**: The argument does not generalize from a small sample to a larger group.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (\(FE\))**: The argument does not claim completeness of enumeration.
- **Inconclusive Reason (\(IR\))**: The reason doesn't demonstrate why learning a second language is not important; it only points out that the parents didn’t do it.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (\(RR\))**: The argument doesn't repeat the proposition as the reason.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (\(WCB\))**: The reason provided (parents' own learning experiences) is not a compelling causal basis to counter the importance of learning a second language.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (\(FU\))**: The argument does not rely on a consensus or majority opinion.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (\(DEP\))**: No ambiguous language use evident in the argument.

### Step 4: Summarize the Findings
- The argument most closely matches the types \(<IR>\) (Inconclusive Reason) and \(<WCB>\) (Insufficient Causal Basis).
- The reason provided (parents not learning another language) does not conclusively demonstrate or provide a compelling causal basis for the proposition (importance of learning a second language).

### Conclusion
The given argument should be classified under:
- **\(<IR>\)**: Inconclusive Reason
- **\(<WCB>\)**: Insufficient Causal Basis

Thus, the specific defective argument types for the string are \(<IR>\) and \(<WCB>\).
