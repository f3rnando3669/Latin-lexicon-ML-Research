For 
To apply IDAA (the application of task decomposition to the task of identifying a defective argument) to the statement "Don't be the only one not wearing Nike!", we need to break down the task of identifying the defective argument step by step:

1. **Analyze the Proposition (<P>):**
   - The Proposition (what the statement is essentially trying to assert) is: "You should wear Nike."
   
2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   - The Reason (the justification for the Proposition) is: "Everyone else is wearing Nike."

3. **Evaluate the Proposition and the Reason:**
   - Now, we need to examine the relationship between the Proposition and the Reason to see if the argument holds up or is defective.

4. **Compare against known defective argument types:**
   - **Generalization (<G>):** This would be the case if the statement was making a broad assertion based on limited evidence. Not applicative here as it does not generalize from a part to a whole.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** This involves missing out relevant possibilities in an asserted complete list. Not applicable here as there is no list of possibilities.
   - **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** This involves the Reason not conclusively demonstrating the Proposition. Here, the reason offered is peer pressure or popularity, which does not logically enforce the necessity of wearing Nike.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** This occurs if the causal basis isn't strong enough to support the Proposition. The causal basis here ("everyone else is doing it") is weak as it doesn't necessarily justify the need to conform.
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** This occurs if the Reason is circular or merely repeats the Proposition. Here, the Reason isn't a direct repetition of the Proposition.
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** This involves assuming a conclusion is correct because "everyone agrees," even if it's in dispute. Here, there's an attempt to use presumed consensus to justify the recommendation.
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):** This involves the Reason being ambiguous or misleading. The language is straightforward, so not applicable here.

5. **Identify the specific defect:**
   - The best fit for the statement "Don't be the only one not wearing Nike!" appears to be **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**:
     - It assumes that because "everyone is wearing Nike," it is universally agreed upon that wearing Nike is the correct choice, a thing which might still be in dispute.
     - Essentially, it relies on assumed collective agreement to press the individual to conform.

Thus, applying IDAA to the statement "Don't be the only one not wearing Nike!" results in classifying the argument as <FU>, Presumptuous Consensus.
