For 
To apply IDAA (the decomposition of IDA into specific steps) to the string "Everybody does it. You should too.", let's proceed step by step in identifying the type of defective argument.

Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)
- The string includes a statement advocating for a specific action. The implied proposition can be formulated as: "You should do it."

Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)
- The reason presented in this argument is: "Everybody does it."

Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>)
- The string does not provide a separate proof of reason outside of the assertion that "Everybody does it."

Step 4: Evaluate the Reason in context of the classified defective argument types:
- We need to analyze whether this Reason fits any of the defined defective argument types (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>).

Let's assess each one individually:

1. **Generalization (<G>):**
   - "Everybody does it" assumes that because many are doing it, it is a good reason for you to do it as well. This is a form of generalization.
   
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):**
   - This argument does not seem to attempt an enumeration of possibilities, so it doesn't fit the definition of <FE>.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):**
   - The reason "Everybody does it" does not conclusively demonstrate why you should do it. It could be argued that this is an inconclusive reason.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):**
   - The causal basis (that everyone does it) may be seen as insufficient for compelling someone to follow suit.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):**
   - The reason does not merely repeat the proposition; they are distinct.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):**
   - This argument assumes that since everyone does it, it is correct without providing concrete proof of this consensus being valid.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):**
   - There does not appear to be significant ambiguity in the language used in the argument.

Considering the given defective argument types:

- The string most closely aligns with **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)** since it assumes that because it is universally agreed upon (or it appears so), it should be accepted without further proof or reasoning.
  
Thus, the string "Everybody does it. You should too." fits the defective argument type **<FU>**.
