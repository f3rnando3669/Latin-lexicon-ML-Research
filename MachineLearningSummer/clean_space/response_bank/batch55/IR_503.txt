For 
To apply the task of IDAA (Decomposition of IDA) to the string "someone who is poor is more credible than someone who is rich", we will follow a structured decomposition of IDA into specific steps. Let's break it down:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (D):

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>)**:
   - Determine the primary assertion or claim in the argument.

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>)**:
   - Identify the causal basis or rationale provided to support the proposition.

3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>)**:
   - Determine any supporting arguments or evidence provided to corroborate the reason.

4. **Classify the Defective Argument (IDA)**:
   - Assess if the argument is of type <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP> based on the identified <P>, <R>, and <PR>.

### Applying IDAA to "someone who is poor is more credible than someone who is rich":

#### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)
- **Proposition (P)**: "Someone who is poor is more credible than someone who is rich."
  - This is the primary assertion or claim the argument makes.

#### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)
- **Reason (R)**: In this particular string, there isn't a clearly stated reason. The statement is a standalone assertion and does not provide a causal basis or rationale to explain why a poor person is more credible than a rich person.

#### Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>)
- **Proof of Reason (PR)**: There is no additional argument or evidence provided in the given string to support the reason. There is no corroborating argument or proof offered.

#### Step 4: Classify the Defective Argument (IDA)
Now we classify the argument under one of the defective arguments:
- **Generalization (G)**: This argument could be perceived as making a broad generalization, as it attributes a quality (credibility) to all individuals based solely on their economic status.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: The argument does not claim to have enumerated all possibilities.
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The argument does not provide any reason at all.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: There is no causal basis given.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: There is no repetition present.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: There is no mention of a consensus.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: The proposition itself is not significantly ambiguous but could be subject to different interpretations of "credibility."

Given these classifications, the most fitting defective argument types for the given string are:
- **Generalization (G)**: The statement generalizes the credibility of an individual based solely on economic status without evidence or a rational causal basis.

**Final Classification:**
The argument "someone who is poor is more credible than someone who is rich" is best classified as **Generalization (G)** because it makes a sweeping assertion about credibility based solely on economic status, applying it universally without substantiation.
