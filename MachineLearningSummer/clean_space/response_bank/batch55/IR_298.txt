For 
To apply IDAA to the string "Researchers are frauds who don’t earn their salaries," we need to break down the classification task step by step. Here’s the decomposition of the task into specific steps:
 
1. **Identify Proposition (P)**: Determine the main assertion or claim made in the statement.
2. **Identify Reason (R)**: Ascertain the reasoning or basis provided for the Proposition, if any.
3. **Identify Proof of Reason (PR)**: Look for any supplementary arguments or evidence supporting the Reason.
4. **Classify the Defective Argument Type**: Based on the identified parts (or the lack thereof), classify the argument into one of the defective argument types.

Now, applying these steps to the string "Researchers are frauds who don’t earn their salaries":

### Step 1: Identify Proposition (P)
The main assertion here is:
- **Proposition (P)**: "Researchers are frauds who don’t earn their salaries."

### Step 2: Identify Reason (R)
The statement does not explicitly provide any causal basis or reasoning for the proposition. 

### Step 3: Identify Proof of Reason (PR)
Since no Reason (R) is provided, there is no Proof of Reason (PR) either.

### Step 4: Classify the Defective Argument Type
With the absence of Reason (R) and Proof of Reason (PR), we can classify the argument type based on the definitions provided:

1. **Generalization (G)**: The proposition seems to be a sweeping assertion about all researchers without specific evidence. It generalizes "frauds" to all researchers.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: This defect does not directly apply since no enumeration of possibilities is claimed.
3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: There is no Reason provided at all, making this inapplicable.
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: Since no causal basis for the proposition is provided, this category is not directly applicable.
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: There is no Reason repeating the Proposition itself.
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: The argument does not claim universal agreement.
7. **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: The language is quite clear without ambiguity in the intended meaning.

Considering the above analysis, the defective argument type that the string best fits into is:

**Generalization (G)**: The statement makes a broad, sweeping claim about the character and value of researchers without supporting evidence, applying a specific assertion ("frauds who don’t earn their salaries") to all researchers in general.

### Conclusion
The defective argument type (G) - Generalization fits the string "Researchers are frauds who don’t earn their salaries."
