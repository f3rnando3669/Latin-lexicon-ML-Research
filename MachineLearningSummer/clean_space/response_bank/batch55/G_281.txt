For 
Applying IDAA to the task of classifying the given debate argument into one of the defective argument types involves breaking down the task IDA (identifying the argument defect type) into specific steps (D). Let’s take it step by step:

### Decomposition of IDAA:
1. **Step 1: Identify Propositions (<P>), Reasons (<R>), and Proof of Reasons (<PR>):**
    - Examine the given argument and identify the proposition, reason, and any proof of reason.

2. **Step 2: Determine if any part (P, R, or PR) is a defective argument type:**
    - Match the identified parts with the definitions of defective argument types: <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, and <DEP>.

### Apply IDAA to the given debate:
#### Argument Analysis:
1. **Identify Propositions (<P>), Reasons (<R>), and Proof of Reasons (<PR>):**
    - **Proposition (<P>):** "People should let their cats go outside."
    - **Reason (<R>):** "Going outside gives cats more exercise."
    - **Proposition (<P>):** "If you let them hunt all the birds, then robins will go extinct."

    The argument contains multiple propositions and reasoning chains.

2. **Determine if any part (P, R, or PR) is a defective argument type:**

    #### Analyzing the first part of the debate:
    - **Proposition (<P>):** "People should let their cats go outside."
    - **Reason (<R>):** "Going outside gives cats more exercise."
    
    This part claims that letting cats outside is beneficial because it gives them more exercise.

    **Possible defects**:
    - **Generalization (G):** This isn't an overgeneralization; it's a specific claim about exercise benefits.
    - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** This doesn't claim to enumerate all benefits.
    - **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** This reason could be inconclusive because more exercise doesn't necessarily justify the action due to potential other harms or risks.
    - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** The causal link between going outside and exercise is plausible but doesn't address potential negative sides (e.g., safety risks).
    - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** The reason isn't just a repetition of the proposition.
    - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** No appeal to consensus here.
    - **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** No ambiguous language in this part.

    **Conclusion for Part 1:** The argument might suffer from **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** as the reason doesn't comprehensively justify the proposition by ignoring other potential negative outcomes.

    #### Analyzing the second part of the debate:
    - **Proposition (<P>):** "If you let them hunt all the birds, then robins will go extinct."

    This part presents a potential negative outcome of the action described in the initial proposition.

    **Possible defects**:
    - **Generalization (G):** This makes an extrapolating assumption that isn't universally applicable; the idea that all robins will go extinct due to cats in one neighborhood.
    - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** The argument doesn't try to enumerate possibilities here.
    - **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** The chain of reasoning is conditional but somewhat speculative.
    - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** This might have an insufficient causal basis since the chain "letting cats out → hunting all birds → robins extinct" is quite speculative.
    - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** This isn’t just a repetition of an earlier proposition.
    - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** No appeal to consensus here.
    - **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** Language use isn't inherently ambiguous, although the causal chain has unstated assumptions.

    **Conclusion for Part 2:** This part can be identified mainly as **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)** as the causal claims are speculative and lack substantiated support.

### Summary Classification:
- **First Statement**: Suffers from **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**
- **Second Statement**: Suffers from **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**

These classifications identify the defective elements within the debate argument.
