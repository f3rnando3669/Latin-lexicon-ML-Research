To classify the argument "Same-sex marriage must be prohibited, or the family structure as we know it will collapse" using the defined defective argument types, we'll decompose the task into specific steps. This approach will help us systematically analyze the argument. Here are the detailed steps:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)
- **Proposition (<P>):**: "Same-sex marriage must be prohibited."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)
- **Reason (<R>)**: "or the family structure as we know it will collapse."

### Step 3: Evaluate the Reason (<R>) and Relate it to the Proposition (<P>)
- Check whether the Reason provides a conclusive causal basis for the Proposition.
- Assess the logical connection between the Reason and the Proposition.

### Step 4: Check for Presence of Defective Argument Types

1. **Generalization (<G>):** 
   - Is the Reason a broad assertion that assumes a general outcome without sufficient evidence applicable to all?
   - In this case, the argument does not appear to generalize based on limited individual examples.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):**
   - Does the Proposition imply a complete enumeration of possibilities without considering all relevant ones?
   - The argument doesn’t enumerate all possible consequences of allowing same-sex marriage, but that’s not its primary structure.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):**
   - Does the Reason conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the Proposition?
   - The collapse of the family structure is a sweeping assertion without detailed evidence. The Reason does not conclusively demonstrate the Proposition.

4. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):**
   - Does the Reason merely repeat the Proposition without adding new information?
   - The Reason does introduce a new concept (collapse of the family structure), so it is not just repeating the Proposition.

5. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):**
   - Is the Reason a weak causal basis for the Proposition?
   - The claim that same-sex marriage will collapse the family structure is a weak causal basis without empirical proof. This fits well.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):**
   - Does the Reason assume everyone agrees on a point that is actually in dispute?
   - The argument does not directly assume a universal consensus but implies a belief that may not be widely accepted.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):**
   - Could the Proof of Reason be interpreted in a different way than intended?
   - The term "family structure as we know it" can be ambiguous and open to interpretation, but ambiguity is not the main flaw here.

### Conclusion
Based on the analysis, the argument "Same-sex marriage must be prohibited, or the family structure as we know it will collapse" demonstrates the following defective argument types:

- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** The Reason provided does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the Proposition that same-sex marriage must be prohibited.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** The Reason given (collapse of the family structure) is not a compelling causal basis for the Proposition.

Thus, the argument can be classified primarily under **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason)** and **<WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis)**.
