For 
To apply <IDAA> (the decomposition of the classification task into specific steps) to the given argument "Murder is morally wrong. Therefore, abortion is morally wrong.", we need to follow a structured approach to classify it as one of the defective argument types.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition <D> for <IDA>:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>)**: Determine what the argument is trying to prove.
2. **Identify the Reason (<R>)**: Determine the causal basis provided to establish the Proposition.
3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>)**: Determine the supporting evidence or additional arguments provided for the Reason, if any.
4. **Evaluate for Defective Argument Types**: Check if the argument falls under any of the predefined defective argument types (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>).

### Applying <D>:

#### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)
   - **Proposition (<P>)**: "Abortion is morally wrong."

#### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)
   - **Reason (<R>)**: The causal basis seems to be the statement "Murder is morally wrong." implying that abortion equates to murder.

#### Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>)
   - There is no additional argument or evidence presented to support the Reason directly in the statement.

#### Step 4: Evaluate for Defective Argument Types
   1. **Generalization (<G>)**: Is the argument basing its assertion on one or a few cases, and then generalizing? 
      - No, it doesn’t generalize from specific instances but equates two concepts morally.

   2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: Does the argument fail to consider all possibilities?
      - This doesn't seem to fit, as it’s not about enumerating possibilities.

   3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: Does the Reason conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the Proposition?
      - Yes, there is a problematic leap in logic. The reason "Murder is morally wrong" does not conclusively prove "Abortion is morally wrong" since it assumes that abortion is equivalent to murder without demonstrating this equivalence.

   4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: Is the causal basis weak?
      - Yes, the causal basis is weak because the argument assumes abortion is murder without addressing the distinctions between them.

   5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: Is the Reason essentially repeating the Proposition?
      - No, the Reason isn't merely repeating the Proposition.

   6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: Is the argument assuming a consensus on a still-disputed issue?
      - No, the argument doesn’t claim a universal agreement.

   7. **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**: Could the Proof of Reason be taken in another sense than intended?
      - This does not seem to fit as there's no ambiguous language.

### Conclusion
The argument “Murder is morally wrong. Therefore, abortion is morally wrong.” primarily falls under the category of **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**, because the Reason provided does not conclusively establish the correctness of the Proposition. There is also a component of **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)** as it assumes an unproven equivalence between murder and abortion without sufficiently compelling justification.
