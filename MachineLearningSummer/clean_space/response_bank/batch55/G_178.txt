To apply the decomposition of the task of classifying the string "If we teach Anton how to drive the car, he’ll want to learn how to fly helicopters next!" as one of the defective argument types (defined as <IDA>), we will follow a structured approach (defined as <IDAA>). Here is the step-by-step decomposition of the task:

### Steps for Decomposition (<D>):
1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>)** - Determine what the argument is intending to prove.
2. **Identify the Reason (<R>)** - Identify the causal basis set forth for the proposition.
3. **Identify any Proof of Reason (<PR>)** - Check for any corroborations or supporting arguments.
4. **Analyze the string against each defective argument type (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>)**:
   - Determine if the argument fits any defective argument type.
   - Provide justification for the classification.

### Step-by-Step Application (<IDAA>):

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>)**:
   - The proposition in the string is: "he’ll want to learn how to fly helicopters next."

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>)**:
   - The reason presented for this proposition is: "If we teach Anton how to drive the car."

3. **Identify any Proof of Reason (<PR>)**:
   - There is no explicit proof of reason provided in the string above.

4. **Analyze the string against each defective argument type**:

   - **<G> (Generalization)**: This string does not make an assertion based on some part or majority of individuals applied to all. It is not a generalization.
   
   - **<FE> (Incomplete Enumeration)**: This argument does not claim to have made a complete enumeration of possibilities. Therefore, it is not an incomplete enumeration.

   - **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason)**: The reason ("If we teach Anton how to drive the car") does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition ("he’ll want to learn how to fly helicopters next"). It makes a speculative leap that is not substantiated.
     - **Classification**: <IR>

   - **<RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition)**: The reason is not simply a restatement of the proposition.

   - **<WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis)**: The causal basis provided is weak, as there is no compelling link between learning to drive a car and wanting to learn to fly helicopters. However, this fits under the broader category of inconclusive reason, so specific classification here overlaps with <IR>.

   - **<FU> (Presumptuous Consensus)**: The argument does not rely on a presumed consensus to support the proposition.

   - **<DEP> (Ambiguous Language Use)**: The language used in the argument is not ambiguous or taken in another sense than the speaker intended.


### Final Classification:
The defective argument type for the string "If we teach Anton how to drive the car, he’ll want to learn how to fly helicopters next!" is best classified as:
- **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason)**

The reason provided does not conclusively support the proposition, making the argument speculative and thereby defective.
