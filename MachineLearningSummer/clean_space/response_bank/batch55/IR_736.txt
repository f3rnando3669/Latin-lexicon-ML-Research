For 
To apply IDAA (the application of decomposing the task of classifying a string as a defective argument) to the given statement "I can’t take home a B in this course. My parents will be angry with me.", let's break down the steps systematically.

### Step 1: Understand and restate the argument
- **Proposition (P)**: "I can’t take home a B in this course."
- **Reason (R)**: "My parents will be angry with me."

### Step 2: Determine if the argument fits any defective argument types
We need to analyze if the provided argument fits any of the defective argument types (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <WCB>, <RR>, <FU>, <DEP>) defined earlier. Let's go through each type in detail.

#### Generalization (G)
- **Definition**: The proposition is based on some parts or a majority but not necessarily applicable to all.
- **Analysis**: The proposition "I can’t take home a B in this course" does not make a generalization about a group based on one part or a majority. It is a specific concern regarding the speaker's grade.

#### Incomplete Enumeration (FE)
- **Definition**: Claiming to have made a complete enumeration of possibilities but missing some pertinent ones.
- **Analysis**: There is no indication that the speaker is claiming to have considered all possibilities for why they can't take home a B.

#### Inconclusive Reason (IR)
- **Definition**: The reason does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition.
- **Analysis**: "My parents will be angry with me" may not be a strong enough reason to fully justify why not getting a B is unacceptable. However, this is subjective and must be further examined.

#### Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)
- **Definition**: The causal basis for the proposition is not compelling.
- **Analysis**: The reason given ("My parents will be angry with me") does give a cause, but whether it is compelling enough is arguable. It may be considered insufficient because being angry is not inherently tied to academic performance directly affecting the student’s ability.

#### Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)
- **Definition**: The reason repeats what was said in the proposition.
- **Analysis**: The reason provided is not merely a restatement of the proposition. They are related but not the same.

#### Presumptuous Consensus (FU)
- **Definition**: Assuming it is certain because "it is universally agreed upon."
- **Analysis**: There is no indication that the argument relies on universally agreed consensus.

#### Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)
- **Definition**: The reason uses ambiguous language.
- **Analysis**: The language used is clear and does not seem to lend itself to multiple interpretations.

### Step 3: Select the most appropriate defective argument type
From the analysis, the most fitting defective argument type appears to be:

- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**

The reason the speaker provides ("My parents will be angry with me") might not be a strong, compelling, or sufficient justification to assert the proposition that they can't take home a B.

### Step 4: Conclusion
The given argument "I can’t take home a B in this course. My parents will be angry with me." is best classified as an argument with an **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**.

Therefore, applying IDAA to this string results in identifying it as a WCB type of defective argument.
