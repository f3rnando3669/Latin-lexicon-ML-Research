For 
To apply IDAA (the application of decomposing an advanced task into specific steps) to the task of classifying the given statement "A fallacy which assumes that because something is popular, it is therefore good, correct, or desirable." as one of the defective argument types (G, FE, IR, RR, WCB, FU, or DEP), we need to break down the process systematically. Here are the steps:

### Step 1: Analyze the Statement
Evaluate the given statement to understand its essence and what kind of argument flaw it describes.

**Statement:** "A fallacy which assumes that because something is popular, it is therefore good, correct, or desirable."

This describes a type of reasoning where popularity is taken as an indication of positive attributes like goodness, correctness, or desirability.

### Step 2: Compare the Statement with Defective Argument Types
Identify which defective argument type best fits the description given by the statement.

- **Generalization (G)**: Based on an assertion applicable to a majority but not necessarily to all.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: Claiming completeness of possibilities but missing pertinent ones.
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: Reason does not conclusively establish the truth of the proposition.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: Causal basis submitted for the proposition is not compelling.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: Reason repeats the proposition without adding new information.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: Assuming something is true because it is universally agreed upon.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: Proposition taken in another sense than intended.

### Step 3: Determine the Classification
Assess which defective argument type aligns most closely with the statement's explanation.

The statement describes a fallacy that assumes something is good, correct, or desirable simply because it is popular. This captures the essence of relying on presumed consensus or majority agreement, which neglects the need for additional supporting evidence.

**Best Matching Defective Argument Type:** **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**

### Step 4: Validate the Classification
Ensure that the chosen defective argument type aligns with the definition provided.

**Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** An argument where a Proof of Reason is assumed certain because "it is universally agreed upon," even though it is still in dispute.

Indeed, the described fallacy involves assuming correctness based on popularity, fitting well with **FU** since it assumes something's validity based on general agreement without further proof.

### Conclusion
By decomposing the task into specific steps and analyzing the given statement against the defined defective argument types, we classify the statement "A fallacy which assumes that because something is popular, it is therefore good, correct, or desirable." as **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**.
