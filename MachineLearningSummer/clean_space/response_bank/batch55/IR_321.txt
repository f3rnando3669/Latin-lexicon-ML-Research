For 
To apply IDAA (the application of decomposing the task of classifying a defective argument), we should first break down the process into specific steps and then apply these steps to the given string. Let's go through this logically:

### Step 1: Parse the string for the argument type indicators

1. **Identify the nature of the argument presented in the string:**
   - "It occurs when someone makes an appeal to emotion of pity instead of addressing the argument."

### Step 2: Classify the argument based on the definitions provided

1. **Determine which defective argument type(s) this matches with:**
   - **Generalization (G)**: The string does not describe a situation where a single example is generalized to all cases.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: The string does not discuss enumeration of possibilities or missing pertinent ones.
   - **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The string does not discuss if a reason is inconclusive.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: The string does not concern the strength of the causal basis.
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: The string does not repeat the proposition.
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: The string does not rely on universal agreement.
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: The string does not present ambiguous language.

### Step 3: Compare the given description with each defective argument type one by one

1. **Identify specific characteristics**:
   - The string explicitly states an appeal to emotion (pity) rather than addressing the argument's merits.

### Step 4: Narrowing down to the most fitting defective argument type

1. **Identify logical fallacies related to appealing to emotion**:
   - This kind of fallacy is classically known as **"appeal to emotion"**, more specifically an **"appeal to pity"**. This fallacy fits under the context of **diverting attention from the argument's merits**.

### Final Step: Conclude the classification

- The description provided aligns most closely with the concept of **"Inconclusive Reason (IR)"** because making an appeal to emotion like pity does not address the argument logically and fails to provide a proper basis for validating the proposition.

Therefore, applying IDAA to the string "It occurs when someone makes an appeal to emotion of pity instead of addressing the argument," we classify it as type <IR>.
