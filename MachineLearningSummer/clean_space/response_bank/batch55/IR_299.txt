Sure, let's break down the task of classifying the given argument according to the defective argument types specified by using the process of decomposition. Here's the application of decomposition <D> to the classification task <IDA>:

### Steps for IDAA (Decomposition Applied to Argument Classification):
1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
   - This step involves pinpointing the main claim or assertion being made.
   
2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   - This step involves finding the causal basis or justification presented in support of the proposition.
   
3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>):**
   - This step involves identifying any additional arguments or evidence provided to support the reason.

4. **Classify the Argument Defects:**
   - Assess whether the argument exhibits any of the defective argument types: Generalization (<G>), Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>), Inconclusive Reason (<IR>), Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>), Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>), Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>), or Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>).

### Applying IDAA to the Example:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
   - Speaker 1: “Donald Trump is a known adulterer.”
   - Additional Proposition by Speaker 1: “It reflects badly on his character, and suggests he might not be trustworthy.”

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   - Speaker 1's Reason: “Being an adulterer reflects badly on his character and suggests untrustworthiness.”
   
3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>):**
   - In this example, there is no additional, more detailed proof presented. Speaker 1's proof of reason relies on the general belief that adulterous behavior impacts character and trustworthiness.

4. **Classify the Argument Defects:**
   - Now, let's look at the response by Speaker 2 and evaluate the defective argument types:
      - Speaker 2: "What about Bill Clinton? You didn’t seem to care when he cheated."
   
    **Analyzing Speaker 2’s Statement:**
    - **Generalization (<G>):** Speaker 2's argument involves making a generalization that because Democrats did not care about Bill Clinton’s infidelity, they should not care about Donald Trump’s infidelity. However, it does not specifically fall under this defect since it is pointing out a perceived inconsistency rather than making an unsupported generalization.
    - **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** This could imply that Speaker 2 is missing other pertinent reasons to also condemn or absolve Donald Trump. However, his point is about perceived inconsistency, not an exhaustive listing.
    - **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** Speaker 2's response does not directly address the trustworthiness proposition about Trump but rather diverts by pointing to Bill Clinton's actions, which is a typical example of the logical fallacy known as "whataboutism," related to inconclusive reasoning.
    - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** Speaker 2's argument does not repeat the proposition.
    - **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** Speaker 2 doesn’t provide a causal basis for the proposition but rather counters with a different topic.
    - **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** Speaker 2 is not claiming consensus but pointing out perceived hypocrisy.
    - **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):** Language used by Speaker 2 is not particularly ambiguous; it is direct but off-topic.

### Classification:

- The primary defective argument type present in Speaker 2’s response is **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**, as the response is a diversionary fallacy (whataboutism) that does not conclusively engage with or refute Speaker 1’s claim about Donald Trump’s character and trustworthiness.

This completes the task of decomposing the argument and classifying it according to the defective argument types using the IDAA process.
