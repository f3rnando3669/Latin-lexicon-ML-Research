To apply the decomposition of the IDAA task to classify the given string, we need to follow a series of steps. Let's break it down:

### Step 1: Understand and Interpret the String

The given string is:
"After Sally presents an eloquent and compelling case for a more equitable taxation system, Sam asks the audience whether we should believe anything from a woman who isn't married, was once arrested, and smells a bit weird."

### Step 2: Identify the Proposition (<P>)

First, we identify the proposition in Sally's argument which can be summarized as:
- <P>: A more equitable taxation system should be adopted.

### Step 3: Identify the Reason (<R>)

Next, from the string, we derive the argument made by Sam:
- <R>: Sally should not be believed because she "isn't married, was once arrested, and smells a bit weird."

### Step 4: Determine the Type of Defective Argument

To classify this argument using the defined defective argument types, we evaluate Sam's reasoning in terms of:

- <G> Generalization: Is he making a generalization based on limited or unrepresentative evidence?
- <FE> Incomplete Enumeration: Is he claiming to have considered all possibilities but omitted some?
- <IR> Inconclusive Reason: Does his reason fail to conclusively establish the truth of the proposition?
- <WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis: Is his causal basis not compelling enough to support the truth of the proposition?
- <RR> Faulty Repetition of Proposition: Is he repeating the proposition without strengthening it with new evidence?
- <FU> Presumptuous Consensus: Is he assuming something as universally agreed upon that is actually in dispute?
- <DEP> Ambiguous Language Use: Is he using language that can be interpreted in a way different than intended?

### Step 5: Classify the Argument

Analyzing Sam's arguments, we see:
- Sam's statements are aimed at attacking Sally's character rather than addressing her argument's content. Hence, the <R> (Sam's reasoning) fails to address <P> (adopting a more equitable taxation system). This makes it an Inconclusive Reason (<IR>).
- Additionally, the reasons provided by Sam do not logically support or detract from the truth of Sally's proposition about taxation. Thus, it can also be seen as having an Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>).

### Conclusion

Based on the aforementioned analysis, Sam's argument can be classified primarily as:
- **<IR> Inconclusive Reason**: Sam's reason does not conclusively refute Sally's argument for a more equitable taxation system.
- **<WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis**: His argument fails because the reasoning is not directly relevant to the proposition and thus not compelling.

Thus, applying IDAA to the string classifies it predominantly under <IR> and could also fall under <WCB>.
