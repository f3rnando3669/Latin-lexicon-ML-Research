For 
To apply the IDAA to "Asians make lousy athletes, but do well at the Math Olympiad," let's break down the task of IDA (classifying defective argument types) step by step. This involves decomposing the argument classification task into manageable segments. Hereâ€™s the step-by-step decomposition and analysis:

### Step 1: Identify the Propositions (<P>)
The statement can be parsed into two propositions:
1. "Asians make lousy athletes."
2. "Asians do well at the Math Olympiad."

### Step 2: Analyze the Reason(s) (<R>) Provided
- **First proposition:** No formal reason is provided; it is an assertion.
- **Second proposition:** While it is relatively straightforward, it is an assertion without an accompanying reason.

### Step 3: Examine the Proofs of Reason (<PR>)
- **First proposition:** There is no proof provided.
- **Second proposition:** Similarly, no proof is provided here either.

### Step 4: Classify Potential Defective Arguments
#### Proposition 1 ("Asians make lousy athletes")
- **Generalization (G):** The statement makes an over-general assertion about all Asians based on unspecified evidence, likely a stereotype.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** Potentially, this could apply if someone were to claim that looking at a subset of Asian athletes proves this point, but ultimately the defect is in the generalization.
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR) and Weak Causal Basis (WCB):** Neither directly apply since no reason or causal basis is given.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** Not applicable here.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** The statement may assume a stereotype that "everyone knows," but does not explicitly do so.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** No ambiguous language here.

The most fitting classification here is **Generalization (G)**.

#### Proposition 2 ("Asians do well at the Math Olympiad")
- **Generalization (G):** Similar broad assertion without detailing if it holds universally.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** If seen in the context of competitive math fields, this might not cover all relevant competitions.
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR) and Weak Causal Basis (WCB):** Again, no reason given here.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** Not applicable.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** One might argue it leans on a commonly accepted positive stereotype.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** No clear ambiguity.

The most fitting classification here is also **Generalization (G)**.

### Conclusion
Both parts of the argument present **Generalization (G)** errors.

### Step 5: Final Classification
Given that both propositions suffer from the same defect, we classify the overall argument string as:
```
G
```

By breaking down the task (IDAA) into specific manageable steps (decomposition), we methodically classified the statement "Asians make lousy athletes, but do well at the Math Olympiad" as a **Generalization (G)** type of defective argument.
