For 
To apply IDAA (decomposing the task of classifying the argument into specific steps) to the argument "God must exist because every culture has some sort of belief in a higher being," we will follow a structured approach to analyze and classify the type of defective argument it represents.

1. **Identify the Proposition (P)**:
   - **Proposition (P):** God must exist.

2. **Identify the Reason (R)**:
   - **Reason (R):** Every culture has some sort of belief in a higher being.

3. **Determine the nature of Reason (R) in relation to Proposition (P)**:
   - Analyze whether (R) adequately supports (P).
   - Consider whether the causal basis provided in (R) is compelling and conclusive for (P).
   - Assess any logical fallacies or weaknesses in (R).

4. **Classification and Analysis**:
   - **Generalization (G):** Is the argument deriving a universal conclusion from specific cases?
     - No, the argument does not seem to be a generalization based on limited cases; it mentions every culture.
   
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** Is there a claim of completeness that misses pertinent possibilities?
     - No, the argument does not claim completeness of possibilities directly.
   
   - **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** Does (R) fail to conclusively demonstrate (P)?
     - Yes, while (R) mentions a universal presence of belief in a higher being across cultures, it does not logically or conclusively establish the existence of God. The presence of belief does not necessarily equate to the reality of what is believed in.
   
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** Is the causal basis submitted for (P) weak or not compelling?
     - Yes, the causal basis that all cultures believe in something higher does not compellingly establish the truth of God's existence. Belief alone is not a strong causal basis for existence.
   
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** Is (R) simply restating (P) without adding any supportive substance?
     - No, in this case, (R) provides additional information (the existence of belief) rather than reiterating (P).
   
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** Does (PR) assume certainty based on presumed universal agreement?
     - Partly, the argument implicitly assumes that universal belief implies truth. This can be linked to presumptive consensus but is more directly addressing the insufficiency and inconclusiveness of (R).
   
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** Is (PR) using ambiguous language?
     - No, the language does not seem to be ambiguous in this context.

Based on the analysis, the defective argument types applicable are:
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The Reason does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the Proposition.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: The causal basis provided for the Proposition (that belief implies existence) is weak.

Therefore, the argument "God must exist because every culture has some sort of belief in a higher being" primarily falls under the categories of **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** and **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**.
