For 
To apply <IDAA> to the string "All those opposed to my arguments for the opening of a new department, signify by saying, ‘I quit.’", we need to decompose the task <IDA> into specific steps and then classify the string according to the identified defective argument types (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <WCB>, <RR>, <FU>, <DEP>).

### Step-by-Step Decomposition:

1. **Identify the Proposition (P):**
   - The core claim or statement the argument is trying to establish.
   - In this case, the proposition might be "Opening a new department is a good idea".

2. **Identify the Reason (R):**
   - The causal basis or rationale behind the proposition.
   - In this sentence, there isn't a specific reason given, the statement is more manipulative in nature.

3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (PR):**
   - Any additional arguments that support the reason.
   - Again, there isn't a supportive argument given in this case.

4. **Look for Defective Argument Types:**
   - **G (Generalization)**
     - P is generalized based on partial data.
     - Not applicable here.
   - **FE (Incomplete Enumeration)**
     - P claims completeness but misses some options.
     - Not applicable here.
   - **IR (Inconclusive Reason)**
     - R does not conclusively support P.
     - Not applicable here (R is not present).
   - **WCB (Insufficient Causal Basis)**
     - R is weak and not compelling.
     - Not applicable here (R is not present).
   - **RR (Faulty Repetition of Proposition)**
     - R repeats P without adding new information.
     - Not applicable here.
   - **FU (Presumptuous Consensus)**
     - PR assumes universal agreement without justification.
     - Not applicable here.
   - **DEP (Ambiguous Language Use)**
     - PR can be interpreted in multiple ways not intended by the speaker.
     - This is not the primary issue here.

5. **Specific Reasoning (Manipulative Tactic Identification):**
   - The proposition and the phrasing are manipulative.
   - This argument dismisses opposition via an ultimatum that implies resignation for disagreement.
   - The tactic implies that opposition is unreasonable or requires a drastic response ("I quit"). 

### Classification:

The defective argument revolves around an **attempt to avoid objections by demanding resignation** rather than addressing concerns. This does not directly correlate with any of the predefined types but shares characteristics with manipulation and the use of coercive language. 

### Conclusion:

Given the definitions, the string doesn't fit cleanly into the given defective argument types. However, the closest applicable type would be similar to **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)** in that it presumes opposition is invalid by using a coercive statement. Although not exactly, it shares the authoritative dismissal of contrary opinions, suggesting that opposition should not exist.

So, the argument "All those opposed to my arguments for the opening of a new department, signify by saying, ‘I quit.’" shows characteristics most similar to:
- **FU (Presumptuous Consensus)** combined with a coercive tactic.
