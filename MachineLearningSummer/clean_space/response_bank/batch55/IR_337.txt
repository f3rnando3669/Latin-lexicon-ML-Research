Certainly! We will decompose the task of classifying the argument as presented by Person 1 into specific steps and apply it to identify whether the argument is of type <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>.

### Decomposition (D) of the Task (t) – <IDA> into Specific Steps:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
   - Determine the main claim or assertion being made.

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   - Determine the causal basis provided for the proposition.

3. **Determine if there is a Proof of Reason (<PR>):**
   - Identify any additional arguments provided to corroborate the Reason.

4. **Classify the Type of Defective Argument:**
   - Analyze whether the identified Proposition, Reason, or Proof of Reason falls into any of the defective argument types: Generalization (<G>), Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>), Inconclusive Reason (<IR>), Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>), Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>), Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>), or Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>).

### Step-by-Step Application of <IDAA>:

Now, apply the above steps to the dialogue between Person 1 and Person 2.

#### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)
Person 1's main claim is:
- “If you are a Marvel fan then you love Avengers: Endgame.” 
This claim could be paraphrased as a conditional proposition.

#### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)
Person 1 provides an implied Reason, which could be interpreted as:
- “Being a Marvel fan is sufficient reason to love Avengers: Endgame.”

#### Step 3: Determine if there is a Proof of Reason (<PR>)
No explicit Proof of Reason is provided by Person 1 to corroborate the Reason. Instead, Person 1 responds to Person 2's rebuttal by asserting:
- “Well you aren’t a TRUE Marvel fan.”
This does not serve as a proof but rather attempts to redefine the terms.

#### Step 4: Classify the Type of Defective Argument

Analyze the Proposition and Reason:
- The argument type in question here seems to rest on the assertion that all Marvel fans must love "Avengers: Endgame". When Person 2 disputes this (showing that being a Marvel fan does not necessarily result in loving "Avengers: Endgame"), Person 1 shifts the argument by using a narrowed definition of what it means to be a "true" Marvel fan.

Based on this analysis, Person 1's argument contains elements of:

1. **Generalization (<G>)**:
   - Person 1 generalizes that all Marvel fans love "Avengers: Endgame", but this does not necessarily apply to all Marvel fans as illustrated by Person 2's counterexample.

2. **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**:
   - Person 1 uses the term "TRUE Marvel fan" in a subjective and potentially ambiguous manner, shifting the meaning of "Marvel fan" to exclude Person 2 who doesn't conform to the initial generalization.

As the primary issue seems to be the sweeping generalization followed by a subjective redefinition of terms, it would be appropriate to classify the argument as primarily a case of **Generalization (<G>)** with elements of **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)** in the final rebuttal.

### Conclusion:
The argument presented by Person 1 can be classified under the defective argument types of **Generalization (<G>)** and **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**.
