Sure, let's apply the process of decomposing the classification task into specific steps to identify which common fallacy this example demonstrates.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition of IDA (Identification of Defective Argument)

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>)**:
   - "The president of Honduras is a good leader."
   
2. **Identify the Reason (<R>)**:
   - "He is a leader of the country."
   
3. **Analyze the Structure**:
   - Determine if there is a Proof of Reason (<PR>).
   
4. **Evaluate the Correspondence**:
   - Check if the Reason (<R>) provides a valid causal basis for the Proposition (<P>).
   
5. **Classify the Defective Argument**:
   - Use the definitions provided for defective arguments to classify the identified issue in the argument.

### Applying the Steps to the Given String

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>)**:
   - Proposition: "The president of Honduras is a good leader."
   
2. **Identify the Reason (<R>)**:
   - Reason: "He is a leader of the country."
   
3. **Analyze the Structure**:
   - In this case, there is no additional proof (<PR>) provided. The argument simply provides a reason.
   
4. **Evaluate the Correspondence**:
   - Evaluate whether the Reason (<R>) "He is a leader of the country" effectively demonstrates the Proposition (<P>) "The president of Honduras is a good leader."

5. **Classify the Defective Argument**:
   - The Reason (<R>) essentially repeats the Proposition (<P>) but rephrased: Saying someone is a good leader because they are a leader does not offer any new, substantive evidence or causal basis. It merely reasserts the initial claim in different words.

Given the definitions of defective argument types, this matches the description of:

- **<RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition):** where the Reason appears to be presented as the Reason, but says precisely the same as was said in the Proposition.

### Conclusion

The fallacy demonstrated by the given argument "The president of Honduras is a good leader because he is a leader of the country." is an example of **<RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition)**.
