For 
Alright, let's apply \(<IDAA>\) to the string "I'm raising funds to help cure XYZ disease. If you don't donate, then you're part of the problem." We'll start by decomposing the task \(<IDA>\) into specific steps (\(D\)), and then proceed to analyze the argument step by step.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (D):

1. **Identify the Proposition \(<P>\):**
   - Determine the main claim or assertion being made.
   
2. **Identify the Reason \(<R>\):**
   - Determine the causal basis or explanation given to support the \(<P>\).
   
3. **Identify the Proof of Reason \(<PR>\):**
   - Determine if additional arguments or evidence are provided to support the \(<R>\).
   
4. **Analyze the Argument for Defects:**
   - Determine if the argument exhibits any of the defined defective argument types (\(G\), \(FE\), \(IR\), \(RR\), \(WCB\), \(FU\), \(DEP\)).

### Applying \(<IDAA>\):

#### 1. Identify the Proposition \(<P>\):
The main assertion is:
- "If you don't donate, then you're part of the problem."

#### 2. Identify the Reason \(<R>\):
The causal basis for the assertion is:
- Implicit in the statement, it's suggesting that not donating contributes to the continuation of the XYZ disease.

#### 3. Identify the Proof of Reason \(<PR>\):
There is no explicit additional proof or evidence provided within the given statement.

#### 4. Analyze the Argument for Defects:

- **<G> Generalization:** The statement does not seem to generalize a specific assertion based on limited examples. \(<G>\) is not applicable.

- **<FE> Incomplete Enumeration:** The statement claims one way of being part of the problem (not donating) but does not enumerate other possible ways. However, this is more about linking behavior to consequence rather than presenting multiple possibilities. \(<FE>\) is not directly applicable.

- **<IR> Inconclusive Reason:** The reason (not donating contributing to the problem) is asserted but the direct causation between not donating and being part of the problem is not conclusively demonstrated. This could point towards \(<IR>\).

- **<RR> Faulty Repetition of Proposition:** The reason does not repeat the exact claim made in the proposition. \(<RR>\) is not applicable.

- **<WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis:** The causal basis given (that not donating equates to being part of the problem) may not be compelling or strong enough. \(<WCB>\) is likely applicable.

- **<FU> Presumptuous Consensus:** There is no explicit statement assuming universal agreement. \(<FU>\) is not applicable.

- **<DEP> Ambiguous Language Use:** The terms used are not highly ambiguous in this context. \(<DEP>\) is not applicable.

### Conclusion:
The defective argument types most applicable to the given string are:

- **<IR> Inconclusive Reason:** The causal link between not donating and being part of the problem is not conclusively established.
- **<WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis:** The causal basis provided is weak and not compelling.

Thus, the argument primarily suffers from \(<IR>\) and \(<WCB>\).
