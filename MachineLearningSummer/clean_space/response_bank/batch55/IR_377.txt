For 
To classify the string "Words with strong feelings that bring about feelings in the reader. Strong words (+ or -) specifically used to sway the reader" as one of the defective argument types (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>), we can employ the task of IDAA, which involves decomposing the task (D) into specific steps and applying it to IDA. Let's go step-by-step:

1. **Step 1: Understand the Given String**
   - The string suggests that the use of emotionally charged words is intended to influence the reader's opinion or feelings.

2. **Step 2: Identify the Proposition and Reason**
   - In this string, it is more descriptive rather than being a full argument with an explicit proposition (<P>) and reason (<R>), but we can infer the general context:
     - **Proposition (P):** Using strong words (+ or -) sways the reader.
     - **Reason (R):** Strong words bring about feelings in the reader.

3. **Step 3: Analyze the Reason**
   - We need to evaluate whether the Reason provides a valid and compelling causal basis for the Proposition.

4. **Step 4: Determine the Argument Type**
   - We need to see if the given argument could suffer from any defective aspects.

5. **Step 5: Compare with Defective Argument Types**
   - **G (Generalization):** The statement does not necessarily generalize a specific case to all cases.
   - **FE (Incomplete Enumeration):** The statement does not enumerate possibilities, so this is not applicable.
   - **IR (Inconclusive Reason):** The reason given (that strong words bring about feelings in the reader) does provide a causal explanation but might not conclusively establish that it always sways the reader.
   - **WCB (Insufficient Causal Basis):** The reason (strong words bring about feelings) can be seen as potentially insufficient in establishing that the reader will definitely be swayed, as it doesn't cover all factors affecting persuasion.
   - **RR (Faulty Repetition of Proposition):** The statement doesn't repeat the proposition; it complements it.
   - **FU (Presumptuous Consensus):** The statement doesnâ€™t rely on a presumed consensus or universal agreement about the power of strong words; rather, it describes an effect.
   - **DEP (Ambiguous Language Use):** The use of "feelings" and "sway" could be subject to interpretation but seems straightforward in context.

6. **Step 6: Identify the Most Likely Defect**
   - **IR (Inconclusive Reason)** or **WCB (Insufficient Causal Basis)** are possible:
     - **IR:** The reason that "bringing about feelings" doesn't conclusively demonstrate that persuasion will occur.
     - **WCB:** The reason given is not compelling enough as it does not account for other factors such as context, individual differences, etc.

Based on these steps, we can classify the string as suffering from **WCB (Insufficient Causal Basis)**. The argument's reason, while it provides a causal link, is not sufficiently compelling to fully establish the proposition that strong words will definitely sway the reader.
