For 
To apply IDAA to "You're wrong because you're ugly!", we need to break down the advanced task of classifying the given argument into specific steps and then follow these steps to identify the defective argument type.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (D):
1. **Identify the Proposition (P) and Reason (R) in the Argument**:
   - The Proposition (P) is the statement that is being argued.
   - The Reason (R) is the causal basis provided to support the Proposition.

2. **Determine if the Argument Contains a Proof of Reason (PR)**:
   - Check if there is additional evidence or arguments corroborating the Reason (R).

3. **Evaluate the Argument Against Known Defective Argument Types**:
   - Generalization (G)
   - Incomplete Enumeration (FE)
   - Inconclusive Reason (IR)
   - Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)
   - Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)
   - Presumptuous Consensus (FU)
   - Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)

4. **Match the Argument to the Defective Argument Type (If Any)**:
   - Compare the identified P and R (and PR if available) against the definitions of defective argument types to find the best fit.

### Application to "You're wrong because you're ugly!"

1. **Identify the Proposition (P) and Reason (R) in the Argument**:
   - Proposition (P): "You're wrong"
   - Reason (R): "because you're ugly!"

2. **Determine if the Argument Contains a Proof of Reason (PR)**:
   - There is no additional evidence or backing provided for the Reason (R), so no Proof of Reason (PR) is present.

3. **Evaluate the Argument Against Known Defective Argument Types**:
   - **Generalization (G)**: Not applicable, because the argument does not generalize a part to the whole.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: Not applicable, there is no claim of complete enumeration of possibilities.
   - **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: Potentially applicable, but we need to explore more.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: Potentially applicable; needs further inspection.
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: Not applicable, the Reason does not simply repeat the Proposition.
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: Not applicable; the reason does not rely on universal agreement.
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: Not applicable as the Reason isn't ambiguousâ€”the meaning is clear.

4. **Match the Argument to the Defective Argument Type (If Any)**:
   - **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: "You're ugly" does not logically or causally demonstrate the truth or falsity of any argument about correctness or incorrectness of the claim "You're wrong". Thus, the Reason is inconclusive to support the Proposition.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: Similarly, calling someone "ugly" does not provide a compelling causal basis to assert that their argument is wrong.

### Conclusion:
The argument "You're wrong because you're ugly!" falls under the defective argument types of **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** and **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**. The Reason provided does not conclusively or compellingly establish the truth of the Proposition.
