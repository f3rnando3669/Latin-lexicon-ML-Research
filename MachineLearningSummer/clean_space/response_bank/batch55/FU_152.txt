For 
To apply the IDAA (application of decomposition to the task of classifying a defective argument) to the statement "Almost everyone at my school will be at the party Friday night. It must be the right thing to do.", we will proceed in specific steps. These steps will help identify which type of defective argument this statement represents.

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition \( <P> \)
The Proposition \( <P> \) is the statement or assertion being made, which we intend to either prove or disprove.

- \( <P> \): "It must be the right thing to do."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason \( <R> \)
The Reason \( <R> \) provides the basis or justification for the proposition.

- \( <R> \): "Almost everyone at my school will be at the party Friday night."

### Step 3: Assess the Proof of Reason \( <PR> \)
The Proof of Reason \( <PR> \) supports the reason by further explanation or evidence.

There isn't a distinct \( <PR> \) in this statement, indicating it relies solely on the reason provided.

### Step 4: Classification by Known Defective Arguments
We need to assess the statement according to the definitions of defective arguments to classify it correctly.

- **Generalization ( \( <G> \) ):** The statement relies on the idea that because "almost everyone" (not necessarily all) will be at the party, it implies the correctness of the action (the "right thing to do"). This seems to fit our case.

- **Incomplete Enumeration ( \( <FE> \) ):** This does not seem applicable as the statement does not claim to present an exhaustive list of possibilities.

- **Inconclusive Reason ( \( <IR> \) ):** The reason given ("almost everyone will be at the party") does not necessarily demonstrate the correctness of the proposition ("it must be the right thing to do"). This also fits our case.

- **Insufficient Causal Basis ( \( <WCB> \) ):** Similar to \( <IR> \), the causal link between the reason and the proposition is weak. This could also be applicable here.

- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition ( \( <RR> \) ):** The reason does not merely restate the proposition in different words, so this doesn't apply.

- **Presumptuous Consensus ( \( <FU> \) ):** The reason implies a consensus ("almost everyone"), which indicates this argument type might apply.

- **Ambiguous Language Use ( \( <DEP> \) ):** There is no indication of ambiguous language or double meaning in this argument.

### Step 5: Determine the Most Suitable Classification
Given multiple overlapping characterizations, determine the clearest and most prominent defect.

- The most evident flaw lies in the assumption that the majority participation at the party implies it is "the right thing to do," which is a classic \( <G> \) (Generalization).
- It also shares traits with \( <IR> \) (Inconclusive Reason) and \( <FU> \) (Presumptuous Consensus), but \( <G> \) fits the context most straightforwardly and highlights the main logical fallacy.

### Conclusion:
The statement "Almost everyone at my school will be at the party Friday night. It must be the right thing to do." primarily represents the \( <G> \) type of defective argument (Generalization).
