For 
To apply the IDAA process to the statement "Sarah likes to run. All girls must like to run," we need first to decompose the task of classification (IDA) into specific steps (D) and then apply those steps. Below is a structured approach:

### Decomposition (D) of IDA into Specific Steps:
1. **Identify the Proposition (P)**: Determine what the statement intends to prove.
2. **Identify the Reason (R)**: Identify the causal basis for the Proposition.
3. **Check for Defective Argument Types**:
   - Determine if the argument is a Generalization (G).
   - Determine if the argument is an Incomplete Enumeration (FE).
   - Determine if the argument has an Inconclusive Reason (IR).
   - Determine if the argument has a Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR).
   - Determine if the argument has an Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB).
   - Determine if the argument is a Presumptuous Consensus (FU).
   - Determine if the argument has Ambiguous Language Use (DEP).

### Application of Decomposed Steps (IDAA):

**Step 1: Identify the Proposition (P)**
- **Proposition (P):** "All girls must like to run."

**Step 2: Identify the Reason (R)**
- **Reason (R):** "Sarah likes to run." 

**Step 3: Check for Defective Argument Types**

- **Check for Generalization (G):**
  - This type checks if the Proposition is an assertion based on a minority or one individual but is applied universally.
  - The argument states that because Sarah (one individual) likes to run (P), therefore, all girls must like to run.
  - **This matches the definition of a Generalization (G).**

- **Check for Incomplete Enumeration (FE):**
  - This involves missing out on some pertinent possibilities in a complete enumeration.
  - There is no enumeration presented in this argument, so this does not apply.

- **Check for Inconclusive Reason (IR):**
  - Checks if the Reason (R) does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the Proposition (P).
  - The Reason here (Sarah likes to run) does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the statement that all girls must like to run.
  - But since Generalization is a more fitting classification, we wonâ€™t categorize it under IR.
  
- **Check for Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):**
  - Determines if the Reason (R) is merely a restatement of the Proposition (P).
  - The statements are not the same, so this category does not apply.

- **Check for Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):**
  - Determines if the causal basis is compelling or weak.
  - The Reason provided is weak, but since it perfectly fits the definition of a Generalization, we will not use this category.

- **Check for Presumptuous Consensus (FU):**
  - Checks if the Proof of Reason (PR) is assumed certain due to universal agreement.
  - There is no claim of universal agreement here.

- **Check for Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):**
  - Determines if ambiguous language leads to a different interpretation.
  - The language is clear and not ambiguous in this statement.

**Conclusion:**
The defective argument type that best fits the statement "Sarah likes to run. All girls must like to run" is **Generalization (G)**.

Thus, the statement is classified as type **<G>**.
