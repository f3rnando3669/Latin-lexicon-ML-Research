For 
Let's apply IDAA, the task of classifying the given string as a specific type of defective argument by decomposing the task into specific steps.

1. **Identify the Proposition <P>**:
   - Look for the main assertion or claim being made.
   - In the given string: "We'll be perfectly safe to shelter by this oak now."

2. **Identify the Reason <R>**:
   - Find the causal basis provided for the proposition.
   - In the given string: "I've never been hit by lightening when standing under a tree."

3. **Check if it's a Generalization <G>**:
   - Is the proposition based on an instance or a majority, and is it being incorrectly generalized to all cases?
   - Yes. The proposition is based on the speaker's personal experience of never being hit by lightning when standing under a tree and is generalizing it to assert safety under any tree, which is not logically supportable in all cases.
   - Classification <G>.

So, let's break it down:
- Proposition <P>: "We'll be perfectly safe to shelter by this oak now."
- Reason <R>: "I've never been hit by lightening when standing under a tree."
- Check for Generalization <G>: The argument assumes that because the speaker has not been hit by lightning under a tree in the past, they are safe now, despite broader statistical evidence about lightning safety.

Thus, the classification of the string is of type **<G>** (Generalization).
