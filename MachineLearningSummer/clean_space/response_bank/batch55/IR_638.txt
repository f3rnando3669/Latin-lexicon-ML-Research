For 
To apply IDAA (the decomposition of the advanced task IDA into specific steps) to the task of classifying the given phrases from the Declaration of Independence, we shall proceed through the following steps:

### Step 1: Understand the Task (IDA)
- **Task Definition (IDA)**: We need to classify the given strings "appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world" and "with a firm reliance on the protection of divine providence" into one of the defective argument types: <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>.

### Step 2: Breakdown and Analyze the Given Strings
- **Given String 1**: "appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world"
- **Given String 2**: "with a firm reliance on the protection of divine providence"

### Step 3: Classify Each String

#### Classify "appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world"

- **Examine for Generalization (G)**:
  - This phrase does not generalize from one part or majority to all. It does not seem to fit <G>.

- **Examine for Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**:
  - This phrase doesn’t attempt to enumerate possibilities. Hence, it does not fit <FE>.

- **Examine for Inconclusive Reason (IR)**:
  - This phrase suggests an appeal to a higher authority but does not provide an inconclusive reason for a proposition. It does not fit <IR>.

- **Examine for Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**:
  - The reason (‘appealing to the Supreme Judge’) here is about an appeal rather than a causal argument for a proposition.

- **Examine for Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**:
  - The phrase does not repeat a proposition. So, it does not fit <RR>.

- **Examine for Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**:
  - This phrase appeals to a universally agreed higher authority or figure, which may still be in dispute. It plausibly fits the type <FU>.

- **Examine for Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**:
  - The phrase "Supreme Judge of the world" is clear, although its religious or secular interpretation might muddy understanding, it generally doesn't fit <DEP>.

  - **Conclusion for String 1**: Likelihood fits <FU> (Presumptuous Consensus).

#### Classify "with a firm reliance on the protection of divine providence"

- **Examine for Generalization (G)**:
  - This phrase also does not generalize from parts to the whole. It is not <G>.

- **Examine for Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**:
  - The phrase does not enumerate possibilities, missing some. So, <FE> is not applicable.

- **Examine for Inconclusive Reason (IR)**:
  - This phrase asserts reliance without definitive proof, which might suggest inconclusive reasoning for a proposition.

- **Examine for Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**:
  - It does not provide a weak basis itself, it’s more an assertion of trust in a higher power.

- **Examine for Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**:
  - The phrase does not repeat a proposition identically. Hence, <RR> does not apply.

- **Examine for Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**:
  - It assumes a universally accepted belief in divine providence, similar to the first phrase. It could be <FU>.

- **Examine for Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**:
  - While there might be some ambiguity in how 'divine providence' is interpreted, it's not explicitly ambiguous enough for <DEP>.

  - **Conclusion for String 2**: Likely fits <FU> (Presumptuous Consensus).

### Step 4: Final Classification
- For **"appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world"**: It most likely falls under **<FU> (Presumptuous Consensus)**.
- For **"with a firm reliance on the protection of divine providence"**: It most likely falls under **<FU> (Presumptuous Consensus)**.

### Summary
Both the given strings from the Declaration of Independence contain appeals to universally accepted higher powers, fitting the type <FU> (Presumptuous Consensus).
