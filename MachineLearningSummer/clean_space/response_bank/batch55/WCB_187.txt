For 
To apply the task of decomposing the identification of a defective argument (IDAA) to the given statement, "Your sister broke her arm, and then you broke your nose. So you assume that a sibling breaking a bone causes you to break one too.", we follow these steps:

1. **Identify the central claim or proposition (P):**
   - **P:** Sibling breaking a bone causes you to break a bone too.

2. **Identify the reason (R):**
   - **R:** Your sister broke her arm, and you broke your nose afterward.

3. **Identify the proof of reason (PR) if applicable:**
   - In this case, a PR is not explicitly stated, so we focus on validating the reason and proposition.

4. **Examine the argument for defects as per defined types (G, FE, IR, WCB, RR, FU, DEP):**

   - **Generalization (G):** Does the proposition generalize from insufficient instances?
     - Yes, the argument generalizes from two instances (sibling and you both breaking bones) to claim a causal relationship for all siblings.

   - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** Does the argument claim to cover all possibilities, but miss some?
     - The argument does not enumerate all possibilities but makes a hasty generalization instead.

   - **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** Does the reason fail to conclusively demonstrate the proposition?
     - Yes, the reason given (sibling's injury followed by your injury) does not conclusively prove the causation claimed.

   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** Is the reason not compelling enough to serve as a causal basis?
     - Yes, the correlation presented here (sibling breaking bone followed by you breaking a bone) is weak and lacks a compelling basis for causation.

   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** Does the reason merely restate the proposition?
     - No, the reason presented is an example rather than a restatement.

   - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** Does the proof assume universal agreement on a disputed point?
     - Not applicable here, as there is no consensus or universally agreed proof presented.

   - **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** Is there ambiguity in the language that can lead to misinterpretation?
     - No significant ambiguity in the language used for the argument.

5. **Classify the string (s) as one or more defective argument types based on the identified issues:**

   - The argument clearly falls under multiple defective types, primarily:
     - **Generalization (G)**
     - **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**
     - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**

Therefore, the string "Your sister broke her arm, and then you broke your nose. So you assume that a sibling breaking a bone causes you to break one too." can be classified as having the defective argument types **G** (Generalization), **IR** (Inconclusive Reason), and **WCB** (Insufficient Causal Basis).
