For 
To apply the task of IDAA to the provided string, we need to break down the process of classifying the string as one of the defective argument types (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>). Let's decompose the task into specific steps (D) and then apply each step to the string "I knew I should have helped that old lady across the road. Because I didn’t, I have been having bad Karma all day."

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (D)

1. **Identify the Proposition (P):**
   - Isolate the main assertion or claim in the string.

2. **Identify the Reason (R):**
   - Determine the causal basis provided for the proposition.

3. **Evaluate the Proof of Reason (PR):**
   - Check if there's additional support corroborating the reason.

4. **Classify the Defective Argument (IDA):**
   - Compare the identified parts (P, R, PR) against the known defective argument types to classify the string.

Now, apply these steps to the string:

### 1. Identify the Proposition (P)
The proposition in the string is:
   - "I knew I should have helped that old lady across the road."

### 2. Identify the Reason (R)
The reason provided for the proposition is:
   - "Because I didn’t, I have been having bad Karma all day."

### 3. Evaluate the Proof of Reason (PR)
In this case, there isn't an additional explicit argument or evidence provided to corroborate the reason. The argument is presented as a direct consequence based on belief.

### 4. Classify the Defective Argument (IDA)
Next, we need to classify the defective argument type by comparing the identified parts to the definitions:

- **Generalization (G):** The statement doesn't seem to generalize a property of a part to the whole.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** No enumeration of possibilities is presented.
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** The reason provided ("Because I didn’t, I have been having bad Karma all day.") does not conclusively demonstrate a direct link between not helping the lady and experiencing bad karma. It's a subjective and superstitious assertion.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** The causal link (bad karma due to not helping) is weak and not compelling.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** The reason provided doesn't simply repeat the proposition.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** No appeal to universal agreement is made.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** No ambiguous language appears to be involved.

Given the evaluation, the most fitting defective argument classification is a **combination of Inconclusive Reason (IR) and Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**. 

However, we typically classify based on the most prominent feature:

### Conclusion:
The string "I knew I should have helped that old lady across the road. Because I didn’t, I have been having bad Karma all day." can be classified under **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**. This is because the reason provided does not conclusively establish the proposition about bad karma resulting specifically from not helping the old lady across the road.
