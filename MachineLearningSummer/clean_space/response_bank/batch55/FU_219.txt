To apply the task of decomposing and identifying the argument type (IDAA) to the given string, we will follow the specific steps involved:

### Step 1: Understand and Decompose the String
Examine the string sentence-by-sentence, word-by-word if necessary, to identify the components of the statement and structure.

**String:** "This is an emotional appeal that speaks the concept that many people agree or disagree, so you should, too."

### Step 2: Identify the Proposition (P)
Define which part of the string is making the proposition.

**Proposition (P):** "You should, too."

### Step 3: Identify the Reason (R)
Determine the reason that is given to support the proposition.

**Reason (R):** "Many people agree (or disagree)."

### Step 4: Identify Supporting Proof of Reason (PR)
Identify if there is a proof or supporting argument provided for the reason.

**Proof of Reason (PR):** The string does not provide any additional arguments to support the reason, hence there is no clear PR in this case.

### Step 5: Assess Completeness and Defects
Now, we need to determine whether the given statement contains any defects as per the defined defective argument types.

- **<G> Generalization:** The statement does not necessarily generalize from a single part or majority; it appeals to a supposed consensus.
- **<FE> Incomplete Enumeration:** No enumeration of possibilities is listed, so this isn’t the case.
- **<IR> Inconclusive Reason:** The reason given (appeal to consensus) is technically a reason, though not a logical one.
- **<RR> Faulty Repetition of Proposition:** The reason doesn’t repeat the proposition verbatim.
- **<WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis:** The causal basis (many people agree/disagree) is weak and not compelling for the proposition.
- **<FU> Presumptuous Consensus:** This matches well since it relies on the assumption that because many people agree or disagree, the person should too, which is still a disputed matter.
- **<DEP> Ambiguous Language Use:** The statement’s language might be ambiguous, but this is not the primary defect here.

### Step 6: Classify the Argument
Based on the identified defects, classify the string.

**Classification:** The argument is best classified as <FU> (Presumptuous Consensus).

### Conclusion
By decomposing the task (IDAA) and taking it step by step, we have classified the string as containing the defective argument type <FU>.
