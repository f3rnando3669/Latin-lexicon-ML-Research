For 
Let’s apply \(IDAA\) to classify the given string according to one of the defective argument types specified.

### Step 1: Understand the Argument
First, we need to break down the given argument:

**String:** "You have to give me a passing grade. I spent 150 hours on that project and missed every party this quarter."

### Step 2: Identify \(P\)
**Proposition (P):** "You have to give me a passing grade."

This is the assertion that the speaker is trying to prove.

### Step 3: Identify \(R\)
**Reason (R):** "I spent 150 hours on that project and missed every party this quarter."

This is the basis that the speaker uses to support the proposition.

### Step 4: Determine if the Argument is Defective
Evaluate the reason provided to determine if it fits any of the defective types:

- **Generalization (G):** Not applicable here; the proposition is not being generalized from a specific subset to the whole.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** Not applicable; there's no enumeration of possibilities.
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** Consider this type. The reason (putting in many hours and missing parties) doesn't logically guarantee that a passing grade is deserved.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** Closely related to \(IR\). The causal link between the effort put into the project and the necessity of a passing grade is not convincingly established.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** Not applicable; the reason is not a simple repetition of the proposition.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** Not applicable; no consensus is assumed.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** Not applicable; the language is clear and unambiguous.

### Step 5: Classify the Argument Type
The most fitting classification is either:

- **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** The effort and time spent don't conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition to grant a passing grade.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** The reason does not provide a compelling causal basis for the proposition.

Given that both \(IR\) and \(WCB\) are related but \(IR\) focuses more on the inconclusiveness, let's prioritize it.

### Conclusion
The argument is best classified as:

**Type:** \(IR\) — Inconclusive Reason.

In this argument, the provided reason (effort and missed social events) does not conclusively establish the necessity of granting a passing grade.
