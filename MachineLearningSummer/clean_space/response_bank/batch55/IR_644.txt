For 
To apply <IDAA> (the application of decomposition to <IDA>), let's break down the task of classifying the string "“against the man;” attacking the individual rather than their position." into specific steps, identifying each step clearly.

### Decomposition of <t> (in this case, <IDA>) into specific steps:

1. **Understand the Argument:** Determine the content and nature of the argument present in the string.
2. **Identify Defective Elements:** Look for elements of the argument that may be indicative of a defective type.
3. **Classify the Defect:** Use the definitions provided to classify the type of defective argument.
4. **Verify the Classification:** Check if the classification aligns with the definitions and the nature of the argument.

Let's apply these steps to the string:

### Step 1: Understand the Argument
The string "“against the man;” attacking the individual rather than their position." suggests an ad hominem argument. This is where one attacks the character or qualities of the individual making the argument rather than the substance of the argument itself.

### Step 2: Identify Defective Elements
The argument "attacking the individual rather than their position" is defective because it does not address the proposition (the position or argument) but rather targets the person making the argument.

### Step 3: Classify the Defect
Now, based on the definitions of defective argument types provided:
- <G>: Generalization — does not fit, as there's no generalization being made.
- <FE>: Incomplete Enumeration — does not fit, as there’s no incomplete listing.
- <IR>: Inconclusive Reason — does not fit directly, as it's not about the strength of the reason but about the focus of the attack.
- <RR>: Faulty Repetition of Proposition — does not fit, as there's no repetition involved.
- <WCB>: Insufficient Causal Basis — does not fit, as is not about the weakness of the causal basis.
- <FU>: Presumptuous Consensus — does not fit, as it is not about assuming consensus.
- <DEP>: Ambiguous Language Use — does not fit, as no ambiguous language is present.

However, the given definition does not cover "attacking the individual rather than their position," which is typically known as an **ad hominem** fallacy. This type of argument is a recognized logical fallacy but is not one among the defective argument types explicitly listed above.

### Step 4: Verify the Classification
Since none of the specific defective argument types provided explicitly match "attacking the individual rather than their position," and because it is a known logical fallacy typically dealt with under the category of ad hominem, it appears our case does not directly fall into the predefined categories of <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>. Ad hominem is a recognized fallacy but not covered by these specific definitions.

### Conclusion
Therefore, "“against the man;” attacking the individual rather than their position." does not classify under <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP> based on the definitions provided, and should instead be recognized as an ad hominem fallacy, which is a distinct category of its own in logical fallacies.
