For 
To classify the string "MacDougal roots for a British football team. Clearly he's unfit to be a police chief in Ireland." into one of the defective argument types, we will decompose the task into specific steps (D) to apply IDAA to IDA.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (D)

1. **Identify the Proposition (P):** Extract the central claim or assertion being made in the argument.
2. **Identify the Reason (R):** Determine the causal basis or reasoning supporting the proposition.
3. **Analyze for Defective Arguments:** Evaluate the proposition and reason to identify if they match any defective argument types.
   - Check for Generalization (G)
   - Check for Incomplete Enumeration (FE)
   - Check for Inconclusive Reason (IR)
   - Check for Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)
   - Check for Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)
   - Check for Presumptuous Consensus (FU)
   - Check for Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)
4. **Classify the Argument:** Based on the analysis, classify the argument as one of the defective argument types.

### Application of IDAA

#### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (P)
The proposition (P) in the given string is:
"Clearly he's unfit to be a police chief in Ireland."

#### Step 2: Identify the Reason (R)
The reason (R) supporting the proposition is:
"MacDougal roots for a British football team."

#### Step 3: Analyze for Defective Arguments

- **Generalization (G):** This doesn't apply here as the argument is not making a broad claim based on a small sample.
  
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** This doesn't apply as we're not dealing with a claim of having considered all possibilities.

- **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** The reason provided doesn't conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition. Rooting for a British football team doesn't logically lead to the conclusion that someone is unfit to be a police chief in Ireland.

- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** The causal basis that supporting a football team reflects on one's ability to perform as a police chief is weak and not compelling. This matches the type fairly closely.

- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** This doesn't apply as the reason is not merely a repetition of the proposition.

- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** This doesn't apply as there is no claim of universal agreement on the reasoning presented.

- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** This doesn't apply as the language used is straightforward and not ambiguous.

#### Step 4: Classify the Argument
Based on the analysis, the argument "MacDougal roots for a British football team. Clearly he's unfit to be a police chief in Ireland." is primarily an example of **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**, since the reason provided is not a compelling or relevant reason to support the proposition that MacDougal is unfit to be a police chief.
