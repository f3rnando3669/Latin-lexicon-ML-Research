Applying IDAA to the task of classifying the given string "one thing leads to another and another and another... creates a 'snowball' effect" involves systematically decomposing and analyzing the steps needed to identify the defective argument type. Follow these steps for a thorough classification:

### Step 1: Understand the String
- Identify the structure and main claim of the string.
    - The string claims a causal chain reaction: one thing leads to another.
    - The term "snowball effect" implies an escalating series of causes and effects.

### Step 2: Match Against Defective Argument Types
- Compare the string with defined defective argument types to see where it fits best.

#### Generalization (<G>)
- Checks if an assertion based on a subset is generalized to all.
    - The string does not appear to generalize a subset to all; it describes a process.

#### Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)
- See if it claims to list all possibilities but misses some.
    - It doesn't list possibilities but describes a continuous effect.

#### Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)
- Whether <R> does not conclusively establish the correctness of <P>.
    - The string implies a causal reason (one thing leads to another), but it's not clear if it conclusively does so.

#### Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)
- If the causal basis for <P> is weak.
    - The "snowball effect" is a causal claim, but it may not provide a compelling reason.

#### Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)
- If <R> repeats <P>.
    - The string does not repeat its initial claim directly.

#### Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)
- Assuming something as certain because "it is universally agreed upon."
    - The string does not assume universal agreement.

#### Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)
- Language can be interpreted in multiple unintended ways.
    - The concept of a “snowball effect” is metaphorical and could lead to different interpretations.

### Step 3: Evaluate Likely Defective Argument Types
- Based on the comparisons, the most likely candidates are:
    - Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)
    - Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)
    - Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)

### Step 4: Deep Analysis
- Analyze the argument deeper to choose the most fitting type.
- The string suggests a causal chain without strong evidence, leaning towards:
    - Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)
    - The metaphor of the "snowball effect" can be misinterpreted:
        - Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)

### Step 5: Conclusion
- The classified type for the given string could be:
    - Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)
    - Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)

Given the initial analysis, the argument implies a causal relationship but may lack a strong basis and can be misinterpreted. Therefore, the string "one thing leads to another and another and another... creates a 'snowball' effect" is best classified as:

1. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**
2. **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**

These classifications provide clear insight into the nature of the defective argument presented.
