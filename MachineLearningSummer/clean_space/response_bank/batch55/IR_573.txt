Certainly! Let's apply the decomposition of the task of classifying the given string into specific steps (IDAA).

**Step 1: Break down the conversation into individual statements or parts for analysis.**

1. Mother: It’s bedtime Jane.
2. Jane: Mom, how do ants feed their babies?
3. Mother: Don’t know dear, close your eyes now.
4. Jane: But mama, do ant babies cry when they’re hungry?

**Step 2: Identify the propositions, reasons, and proofs of the reasons within each statement or part.**

1. Proposition (P): “It’s bedtime Jane.”
2. Proposition (P): “Mom, how do ants feed their babies?”
3. Proposition (P): “Don’t know dear, close your eyes now.”
4. Proposition (P): “But mama, do ant babies cry when they’re hungry?”

**Step 3: Determine if any of these propositions can be supported or if any reasoning follows for each statement.**

1. Proposition (P): “It’s bedtime Jane.” – There is no reasoning or proof provided here.
2. Proposition (P): “Mom, how do ants feed their babies?” – This is a question rather than an argument.
3. Proposition (P): “Don’t know dear, close your eyes now.” – 'Don't know' is an admission of missing reasoning, and 'close your eyes now' is an instruction without a reason.
4. Proposition (P): “But mama, do ant babies cry when they’re hungry?” – Another question rather than an argument.

**Step 4: Analyze each part for any defective arguments according to the specified classifications.**

1. “It’s bedtime Jane.” - No argument here, just a proposition.
2. “Mom, how do ants feed their babies?” - A question, not an argument.
3. “Don’t know dear, close your eyes now.” - Offers no reason or support for the proposition ("close your eyes now").
4. “But mama, do ant babies cry when they’re hungry?” - Again, a question, not an argument.

**Step 5: Classify each statement to see if it fits into one of the defective argument types <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>.**

- “It’s bedtime Jane.” Though a proposition, it lacks reasoning, so it could relate to a weak argument structure but isn’t fully classifiable by the defective types since it lacks an attempt at causal reasoning or supporting proof.
- “Mom, how do ants feed their babies?” This is purely a question, not inherently fitting into any defective argument types given.
- “Don’t know dear, close your eyes now.” This lacks reasoning/causal basis for the instruction "close your eyes now" and could be seen as having an *Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)* if one considers "Don’t know" an inadequate cause for the instruction.
- “But mama, do ant babies cry when they’re hungry?” This is another question and is not an argument or proposition in of itself.

**Step 6: Conclude the classification.**

The closest match to a defective argument type from the given dialogue is:

- **“Don’t know dear, close your eyes now.”** This statement suffers from *Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)* as the provided response "Don't know" does not justify the instruction to "close your eyes now."

Therefore, applying IDAA to the given conversation, we conclude that the statement "Don’t know dear, close your eyes now." fits the defective argument type **<WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis)**.
