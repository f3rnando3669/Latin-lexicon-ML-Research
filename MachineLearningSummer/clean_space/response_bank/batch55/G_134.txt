For 
To apply <IDAA> to the given argument, let's decompose the task <IDA> into specific steps and then analyze the argument step by step.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (D) of <IDA>:
1. **Identify the Proposition (P):** Determine what the argument is intending to prove.
2. **Identify the Reason (R):** Identify the causal basis provided for the Proposition.
3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (PR):** Look for additional arguments that corroborate the Reason.
4. **Classify the Argument Type:** Based on the identified components, classify the argument as one of the defective types: <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>.

### Applying <IDAA> to the Provided Argument:

The argument is:
"If voluntary euthanasia were to be legalized it would prove impossible to avoid the legislation, or, at least, toleration, of non-voluntary euthanasia. Even if the former can be justified, the latter clearly cannot. Hence, it is better that the first step (legalizing voluntary euthanasia) not be taken so as to prevent a slide into non-volunteer euthanasia."

#### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (P)
The proposition here is: "It is better that the first step (legalizing voluntary euthanasia) not be taken."

#### Step 2: Identify the Reason (R)
The reason provided for the proposition is: "It would prove impossible to avoid the legislation, or, at least, toleration, of non-voluntary euthanasia."

#### Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason (PR)
The proof of the reason is lacking in rigorous evidence, but it implies:
"Even if voluntary euthanasia can be justified, non-voluntary euthanasia clearly cannot."

#### Step 4: Classify the Argument Type
With the identified components, we can now classify the argument based on the definitions provided:

1. **Generalization (<G>):** This doesn't apply as the argument is not making a broad generalization based off a specific instance or subset of instances.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** The argument does not seem to claim a complete list of possibilities while missing out on pertinent ones.
3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** The reason given does not conclusively demonstrate that legalizing voluntary euthanasia will unavoidably lead to non-voluntary euthanasia. This jump from voluntary to non-voluntary euthanasia lacks direct evidence or logical necessity.
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** The causal relationship between legalizing voluntary euthanasia and the inevitability of non-voluntary euthanasia is not compellingly demonstrated.
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** The reason isn't merely a repetition of the proposition.
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** The argument does not assume the disputed point is universally agreed upon.
7. **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):** The language used is clear and specific about its points.

Based on this analysis, the argument seems best classified as:
- <IR> (Inconclusive Reason): The reason given, that legalizing voluntary euthanasia will unavoidably lead to non-voluntary euthanasia, does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition.
- Additionally, it also fits <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis): The reason's causal link is weak and not compelling.

### Conclusion
Applying <IDAA> to the argument "If voluntary euthanasia were to be legalized... to prevent a slide into non-voluntary euthanasia," we classify it as <IR> for having an inconclusive reason and <WCB> for having an insufficient causal basis.
