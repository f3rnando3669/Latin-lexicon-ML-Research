Sure, let's break down the task of classifying the given string into the specific defective argument types, step by step, using the IDAA method. Here's the string we need to classify: "Explaining that trusting the other politician will cause everyone to lose their homes and jobs."

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)
Identify what the string is trying to assert or prove. 

**Proposition (<P>):**
"Trusting the other politician will cause everyone to lose their homes and jobs."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)
Identify the basis or reasoning that supports the proposition, if explicitly present.

**Reason (<R>):**
The reason seems to be implied rather than explicitly stated. It's suggesting that the cause of losing homes and jobs is the trust in the other politician.

### Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>)
Identify if there's any specific proof or additional argument substantiating the reason.

**Proof of Reason (<PR>):**
There doesn't appear to be a concrete proof presented in the string.

### Step 4: Classify the Defective Argument Type (<IDA>)
With the components identified, we now classify the argument. Here are the possible defective argument types:

1. **Generalization (<G>)**: This involves asserting something based on a limited set of data.
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: This involves missing out some possibilities in enumeration.
3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: This involves reasoning that doesn't conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition.
4. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: This involves the reason restating the proposition.
5. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: This involves a reason that is not compelling enough.
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: This involves assuming something is universally agreed upon.
7. **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**: This involves the proof or language that can be taken in another sense.

### Step 5: Determine the Type
Based on the identified components:

- The proposition "trusting the other politician will cause everyone to lose their homes and jobs" presents a consequence without providing clear evidence or concrete causal connections. Thus, it primarily suffers from an **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)** because the causal basis suggested (trusting the other politician) is not compelling or substantiated.

### Step 6: Verify the Classification
Let's ensure that no other defective argument type fits better:

- **Generalization (<G>)** might apply if it was generalized from a specific instance or few cases.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)** is not applicable here as there's no enumeration.
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)** could be partially applicable but doesn't cover the lack of proof.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)** is not applicable since the reason is not just a repetition.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)** assumes universal agreement, which isn’t directly implied here.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)** could apply if the statement was vague, but it’s fairly direct in its intent.

Given these considerations, **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)** remains the most fitting classification.

### Conclusion
Applying the IDAA method step by step, the string "Explaining that trusting the other politician will cause everyone to lose their homes and jobs" is classified as type **<WCB>** – Insufficient Causal Basis.
