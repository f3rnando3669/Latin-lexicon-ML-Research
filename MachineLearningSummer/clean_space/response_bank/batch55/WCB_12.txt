For 
To apply IDAA (the decomposition of the task of classifying an argument into specific steps) to the given statement "The dinosaurs became extinct because they ate vegetables..." and classify it as one of the defective argument types (G, FE, IR, RR, WCB, FU, DEP), we follow these steps:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (P)
The Proposition (P) is the main assertion or claim being made in the argument. In the given statement, the proposition is:
- "The dinosaurs became extinct."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (R)
The Reason (R) is the causal basis set forth to establish the truth of the Proposition. In the given statement, the reason is:
- "because they ate vegetables."

### Step 3: Analyze the Reason (R) for Completeness and Causal Strength
Check if the reason (R) adequately supports and conclusively demonstrates the correctness of the Proposition (P).

### Step 4: Identify the Proof of Reason (PR)
Since the given statement does not provide additional corroborating arguments, there is no explicit Proof of Reason (PR). The statement lacks evidence or supporting details, so this step is not applicable here.

### Step 5: Analyze for Defective Argument Types
Now, let's analyze the argument against the defective argument types to classify it appropriately. 

- **Generalization (G)**: This would involve making a claim about all members based on some. The reason does not generalize an observation about specific dinosaurs to all of them, so it does not fit G.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: This involves claiming a complete enumeration but missing possibilities. The statement does not enumerate possibilities, so it does not fit FE.
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The reason does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition. In this case, the reason "because they ate vegetables" does not seem to conclusively cause the extinction of dinosaurs as it lacks scientific backing.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: A reason (R) that is weak if the causal basis it submits for the proposition is not compelling. Here, claiming that eating vegetables caused extinction is a weak causal basis because it is not a compelling reason for extinction.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: This occurs when the reason repeats the proposition. The reason does not repeat the proposition here, so it is not RR.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: Assuming something is certain because it is "universally agreed upon." This does not apply as there is no mention of universal agreement.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: If it is taken in another sense than intended. The language here is not ambiguous, so it does not fit DEP.

### Step 6: Classify the Argument
Based on the above analysis, the most fitting defective argument type for the given statement "The dinosaurs became extinct because they ate vegetables..." is:

**<WCB> - Insufficient Causal Basis**

The causal basis submitted for the proposition is weak and not compelling to explain the extinction of dinosaurs.

**Conclusion:**
The statement "The dinosaurs became extinct because they ate vegetables..." is an example of **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**.
