For 
To apply <IDAA> to the given string, we need to decompose the task <IDA> into specific steps and then apply those steps to classify the argument. Let's take it step by step:

**Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)**  
Determine what the statement is trying to prove.

**Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)**  
Determine the causal basis or rationale given to support the Proposition.

**Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>)**  
Determine if there is any additional argument provided to back up the Reason.

**Step 4: Evaluate each part for defects**  
Analyze the <P>, <R>, and <PR> to check if they fall under any defective argument types: <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>.

Let's analyze the argument:

**Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)**  
The proposition can be identified as: "Sexual immorality is acceptable."

**Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)**  
The reason provided for this proposition is: "Jimmy Swaggart argued strongly against sexual immorality, yet while married, he has had several affairs with prostitutes."

**Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>)**  
There is no separate proof provided here beyond the Reason itself.

**Step 4: Evaluate each part for defects**  
1. **Is the Proposition (<P>) based on Generalization (<G>)?**
   - No, the assertion does not generalize from a part to a whole or from the majority to all.

2. **Is the Proposition based on Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)?**
   - No, there is no enumeration of possibilities provided.

3. **Does the Reason (<R>) constitute an Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)?**
   - The Reason does not logically demonstrate the correctness of the Proposition. Just because Jimmy Swaggart, a known figure against sexual immorality, engaged in immoral behavior, does not logically imply that sexual immorality is acceptable. This is clearly an example of _ad hominem_ fallacy, where an attack on the person (Swaggart's hypocrisy) is used to refute their argument (against sexual immorality), which isn't a conclusive reason.

4. **Is the Reason (<R>) a Faulty Repetition of the Proposition (<RR>)?**
   - No, the Reason does not merely repeat the Proposition.

5. **Is the Reason (<R>) based on an Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)?**
   - Yes, the Reason is weak because the behavior of one individual does not provide a compelling causal basis for the Proposition that sexual immorality is acceptable.

6. **Does the Proof of Reason (<PR>) show Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)?**
   - No, there is no assumption of universal agreement for the Proof given.

7. **Is there Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>) in the Proof of Reason?**
   - No, there is no ambiguity apparent in the language used.

Based on the above analysis, the argument falls under two defective argument types: **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)** and **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**.
