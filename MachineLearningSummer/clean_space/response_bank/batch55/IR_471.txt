For 
To apply the IDAA (Identification and Analysis of Argument Defects) to the statement "politicians coin names to cast blame", we need to follow a systematic breakdown of this task into specific steps. We'll decompose the task of classifying an argument defect (IDA) and apply it step by step.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (D) of IDAA

1. **Identify the Proposition (P):**
   - Determine the main assertion or claim of the argument.

2. **Identify the Reason (R):**
   - Identify the basis or reasoning provided to support the main assertion.

3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (PR):**
   - Look for additional arguments or evidence provided to support the reason.

4. **Evaluate for Defective Argument Types:**
   - Compare the components (P, R, PR) against the list of defective argument types (G, FE, IR, RR, WCB, FU, DEP) to classify the defect.

### Application to "politicians coin names to cast blame"

#### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (P)
The statement "politicians coin names to cast blame" seems to assert a general behavior of politicians. Therefore, the proposition (P) is:
- **P**: Politicians coin names to cast blame.

#### Step 2: Identify the Reason (R)
The statement itself does not explicitly provide a causal basis for this claim, making it harder to identify an evident reason (R). It appears to be more of an implicit assumption rather than a reasoned argument.

#### Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason (PR)
Since there is no explicit reason (R) provided, there cannot be a proof of reason (PR) directly ascertainable from the given statement.

#### Step 4: Evaluate for Defective Argument Types
We need to evaluate the statement against the known defective argument types:

- **Generalization (G)**: Does the statement make an assertion based on limited information that is applied to all politicians?
  - Yes, it seems to make a broad assertion about all politicians based on what could be only some politicians' behavior.

- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: Does the statement claim a complete enumeration of possibilities?
  - No, the statement does not attempt to enumerate or list possibilities.

- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: Does the reason (R) fail to conclusively support the proposition (P)?
  - Not applicable here because an explicit reason (R) isn't provided.

- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: Is the causal basis for (P) weak?
  - Not applicable due to the absence of an explicit reason (R).

- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: Does the reason (R) restate the proposition (P)?
  - Not applicable due to the absence of an explicit reason (R).

- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: Does the proof of reason (PR) assume something is universally agreed upon?
  - Not applicable in this case.

- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: Is the proof of reason (PR) potentially misleading or ambiguous?
  - Not applicable in this context.

Given this evaluation, the most fitting classification for "politicians coin names to cast blame" is:

- **Type (G) Generalization**: The statement makes a broad assertion about the behavior of all politicians based on the presumed behavior of some, which may not necessarily be true for everyone.

### Conclusion:
The statement "politicians coin names to cast blame" is classified as **Type (G) Generalization** according to the task <IDA>. Therefore, the application of <D> to <IDA> results in the classification of the statement as a defective argument of type <G>.
