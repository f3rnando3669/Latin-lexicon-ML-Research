For 
To apply <IDAA> to classify the argument "The majority of students are in favor of changing the colors of the graduation gowns to a single color to not exclude those that are non-binary, but a few people complained it wasn't 'tradition', so let's meet in the middle and just allow students to not attend graduation if they don't want to wear the traditional black and gold," we need to decompose the task of classifying the argument into specific steps. Here is the step-by-step process:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
   - Determine what the central claim or assertion is in the argument.
   - In this case, the Proposition is: "Let's meet in the middle and just allow students to not attend graduation if they don't want to wear the traditional black and gold."

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   - Find the causal basis given for the Proposition.
   - Here, the Reason is: "The majority of students are in favor of changing the colors of the graduation gowns to a single color to not exclude those that are non-binary, but a few people complained it wasn't 'tradition'."

3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (<PR>):**
   - Check if there are additional arguments provided to support the Reason.
   - In this argument, there does not seem to be an extended Proof of Reason provided. It is mainly a direct Reason.

4. **Check for Defective Argument Types:**
   - <G> (Generalization): Is the argument making a broad assumption based on a majority but not all?
     - Yes, the argument states that "the majority" of students favor the change, but it then uses this to address all students by allowing those who don't favor the change to not attend graduation.
   - <FE> (Incomplete Enumeration): Does the argument claim to consider all possibilities but fail to do so?
     - This argument doesn't list all possibilities explicitly but implies there are only two optionsâ€”changing the color or adhering to tradition.
   - <IR> (Inconclusive Reason): Does the Reason fail to conclusively prove the Proposition?
     - The Reason does not conclusively justify the proposition of allowing students to opt-out of graduation; it appears to create a compromise without thorough justification.
   - <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis): Is the causal basis for the Reason weak or uncompelling?
     - The causal basis seems compelling with respect to the included reasons (non-binary inclusion vs. tradition).
   - <RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition): Is the Reason just a re-statement of the Proposition?
     - No, the Reason and the Proposition are distinct in this case.
   - <FU> (Presumptuous Consensus): Is the Proof of Reason assumed universally agreed upon without evidence?
     - There is no specific Proof of Reason that is assumed universally agreed upon in this argument.
   - <DEP> (Ambiguous Language Use): Is the Proof of Reason open to interpretation due to ambiguous language?
     - There isn't a specific <PR> in the provided argument that could be interpreted differently.

5. **Classify the Argument:**
   - Based on the analysis, the argument can be primarily classified as <G> (Generalization) since the initial claim is based on the majority's opinion but extends the solution to all students, even those not necessarily represented by "the majority."

Hence, the argument "The majority of students are in favor of changing the colors of the graduation gowns to a single color to not exclude those that are non-binary, but a few people complained it wasn't 'tradition', so let's meet in the middle and just allow students to not attend graduation if they don't want to wear the traditional black and gold," is of type <G> (Generalization).
