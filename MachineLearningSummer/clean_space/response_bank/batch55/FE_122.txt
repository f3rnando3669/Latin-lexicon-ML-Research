Alright, let's apply \(<IDAA>\) to the statement "If you don't pay taxes, you don't deserve the right to vote."

### Step-by-Step Decomposition \((D)\):
1. **Identify the Proposition \((P)\):** Determine what is intended to be proven by the argument.
2. **Identify the Reason \((R)\):** Find the causal basis or reasoning supporting the \(P\).
3. **Identify the Proof of Reason \((PR)\):** Look for any additional arguments that corroborate \(R\).
4. **Classify** whether the argument belongs to one of the defective argument types (\(<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>\)).
5. **Describe** any defects according to the classification.

### Applying Steps to "If you don't pay taxes, you don't deserve the right to vote":

1. **Identify the Proposition \((P)\):**
   - Proposition: People who don't pay taxes don't deserve the right to vote.

2. **Identify the Reason \((R)\):**
   - Reason: Implicitly, the argument suggests that paying taxes is a necessary condition for deserving the right to vote.

3. **Identify the Proof of Reason \((PR)\):**
   - Proof of Reason: This statement lacks a corroborating argument or additional justification. It merely makes the assertion without providing supporting evidence.

4. **Classify** (We need to check each defective type to see which, if any, apply):

   - **\(<G>\)** Generalization: 
     - The statement doesn't necessarily represent a generalization about a majority of individuals but might be based on the assumption that all non-taxpayers are essentially the same (a traditional generalization would need more explicit statistical assertions).

   - **\(<FE>\)** Incomplete Enumeration:
     - No enumeration or sets of possibilities are presented, so this does not apply.

   - **\(<IR>\)** Inconclusive Reason:
     - The reason provided that paying taxes is a necessary condition for voting rights does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition. There are other facets of civic responsibility and eligibility criteria for voting that are overlooked.

   - **\(<WCB>\)** Insufficient Causal Basis:
     - Suggesting that paying taxes alone justifies the right to vote without discussing other aspects of citizenship and civic duty is a weak causal basis.

   - **\(<RR>\)** Faulty Repetition of Proposition:
     - The Reason does not exactly repeat the Proposition.

   - **\(<FU>\)** Presumptuous Consensus:
     - There's no assertion that the statement is universally agreed upon, so this does not apply.

   - **\(<DEP>\)** Ambiguous Language Use:
     - The terms are clear and there is no evident ambiguity.

5. **Describe the Defects:**
   - The argument could be classified as having an **Inconclusive Reason \((IR)\)** because the reasoning given does not conclusively demonstrate the proposition.
   - It could also exhibit features of **Insufficient Causal Basis \((WCB)\)** because the causal link submitted (paying taxes) for the proposition (deserving the right to vote) is not compellingly justified.

### Classification:
The statement "If you don't pay taxes, you don't deserve the right to vote." can be classified as having defects of types **\(<IR>\)** and **\(<WCB>\)**.
