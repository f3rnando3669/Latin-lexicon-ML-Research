For 
To apply IDAA (the process of decomposing and analyzing a task) to the task of classifying the given statement "Kirk drew a picture of a fish and a human and with effusive disdain asked Richard if he really thought we were stupid enough to believe that a fish somehow turned into a human through just, like, random things happening over time," we'll take the following specific steps:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (\<P\>)

Firstly, identify what is being asserted or proposed in the statement. In this case, the proposition seems to be Kirk’s skeptical question about the plausibility of evolution from fish to human by random events.

**Proposition (P):**
- The proposition implied by the question is that it is implausible to believe that a fish turned into a human through random things happening over time.

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (\<R\>)

Next, determine the reason (causal basis) provided to support the proposition. In this statement, Kirk's reason is implied in his disdainful questioning of the plausibility of the evolution process ("random things happening over time").

**Reason (R):**
- Kirk questions the likelihood of complex evolutionary changes occurring just "through random things happening over time."

### Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason (\<PR\>)

Look for any supporting evidence or arguments that corroborate the reason given. In this specific statement, there isn’t an explicit proof of reason provided; it's more a rhetorical question that expresses skepticism.

**Proof of Reason (PR):**
- Not explicitly provided. Kirk's argument is based on rhetorical questioning rather than concrete proof.

### Step 4: Classify the Argument Based on Defective Types

Now, we assess whether the argument falls into one of the predefined defective argument types:

1. **Generalization (G)**: Is the skepticism based on a non-universal assertion?
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: Are all possibilities considered, or just selectively ignored?
3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: Does the reason conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition?
4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: Is there a compelling causal basis presented?
5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: Does the reason merely restate the proposition?
6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: Is there a claim that “everyone knows” something which is still in dispute?
7. **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: Is there ambiguous language that can be taken in another sense?

**Classification:**

- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: Kirk's rhetorical question assumes that evolution involves only "random things happening over time" without considering other mechanisms like natural selection, mutation mechanisms, and genetic drift.
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: The reason provided ("random things happening over time") does not conclusively demonstrate the implausibility of evolution as it dismisses well-established scientific theories without addressing them rigorously.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: The causal basis (random events) provided to challenge the evolutionary theory is not compelling, as it oversimplifies the complexity of evolutionary biology.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: The phrase “random things happening over time” is vague and can be interpreted in multiple ways that do not accurately reflect evolutionary biology.

### Conclusion

Applying IDAA to the given statement, we classify it primarily as:
1. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**
2. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**
3. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**
4. **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**

These classifications reflect the various ways in which the argument presented by Kirk is defective.
