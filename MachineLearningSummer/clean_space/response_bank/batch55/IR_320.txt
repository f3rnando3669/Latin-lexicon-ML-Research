To apply the decomposition of the task of classifying the string as a type of defective argument step-by-step, we need to break down and analyze the argument provided:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)

The proposition is the main point or conclusion the arguer intends to prove. In the provided string:
```
Your honor, while my son may have made a bad decision that night while under the influence of alcohol, it shouldn't affect the rest of his life.
```
The proposition here seems to be:
```
[P]: The bad decision made by the son should not affect the rest of his life.
```

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)

The reason provides the causal basis for the proposition, explaining why the proposition should be considered true:
```
R: It was just one mistake. He's on the varsity swim team.
```

### Step 3: Identify Potential Proof of Reason (<PR>)

A proof of reason would provide additional support for the reason, but here it seems there is no in-depth argument or proof:
```
PR: There is no explicit proof of reason; the statement "It was just one mistake. He's on the varsity swim team." is being used somewhat as a justification or implicit proof.
```

### Step 4: Evaluate for Defective Argument Types

Now we will evaluate the provided string according to the predefined defective argument types:

- **Generalization (<G>)**: 
  This occurs when an assertion based on one part or majority is incorrectly generalized to all. This doesn't seem to fit as it's not generalizing from a part to a whole.

- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: 
  This happens when claiming a complete enumeration of possibilities but missing some. Not applicable here since the argument doesn't suggest an exhaustive list of possibilities.

- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: 
  This is when the reason does not conclusively support the proposition. The reason that the son is "on the varsity swim team" and it was "just one mistake" does not conclusively demonstrate why his bad decision should not affect his life. This seems quite fitting for this case.
  
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: 
  If the causal basis for the proposition is not compelling, then it’s a weak reason. Saying "he’s on the varsity swim team" doesn't in itself strongly argue why his life should not be affected by the bad decision.

- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: 
  This is when the reason merely repeats the proposition. This isn't the case here since the reason "it was just one mistake, he’s on the varsity swim team" is not a mere repetition of the proposition.

- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: 
  This would be assuming something is certain because it's universally agreed upon. The argument does not rest on presumed consensus.

- **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**: 
  When the language can be taken in another sense than the intended one. The argument here doesn't seem to have any ambiguous language.

### Step 5: Conclusion

Based on the evaluation, the presented argument mainly fits the criteria for:

- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The reason given (being on the varsity swim team and it being just one mistake) does not conclusively support the proposition that the bad decision should not affect the rest of his life.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The fact that he is on the varsity swim team does not provide a compelling causal basis to justify the proposition.

Thus, the defective argument types most applicable to the string would be **<IR>** and **<WCB>**.

### Summary Output

```
IR, WCB
```
