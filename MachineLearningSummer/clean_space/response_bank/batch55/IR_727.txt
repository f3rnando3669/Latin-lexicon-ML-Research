For 
To apply <IDAA> to the string “Are you one of those stupid religious people that reject science?”, we need to break down the task of classifying the string as a certain type of defective argument through specific steps. Let’s go through the steps in a structured manner:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)
The first part of <IDAA> involves identifying if there is a proposition (<P>) in the string.

- In the provided string, there is an implicit proposition: "Religious people reject science."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)
Next, we need to see if there is any causal basis provided for the proposition in the string.

- The string does not explicitly provide a causal basis or reason.

### Step 3: Evaluate for Proof of Reason (<PR>)
Then, check if there is any proof presented for the reason.

- There is no explicit proof offered in the string.

### Step 4: Classify the Defective Argument Type
Now, we need to classify the string according to the given defective argument types:
- <G> (Generalization)
- <FE> (Incomplete Enumeration)
- <IR> (Inconclusive Reason)
- <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis)
- <RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition)
- <FU> (Presumptuous Consensus)
- <DEP> (Ambiguous Language Use)

Let's assess each in the context of the string:
#### Generalization (<G>)
- This string seems to encompass a generalization. It implies that all religious people are of a particular type (those who reject science) based on an unspecified observation.

#### Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)
- Incomplete Enumeration is not directly applicable since the string does not attempt to list possibilities or exhaustively enumerate cases.

#### Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)
- Inconclusive Reason does not apply because the string lacks any reason or rationale offered for the proposition.

#### Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)
- Insufficient Causal Basis would apply if there was a weak reason provided. Since no reason is given, it does not apply here.

#### Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)
- Faulty Repetition of Proposition also does not apply as there is no repetition of the proposition with a different label.

#### Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)
- Presumptuous Consensus does not apply because the string does not appeal to universal agreement or consensus.

#### Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)
- Ambiguous Language Use does not directly apply since the statement’s meaning is clear, despite potentially being offensive.

Given this analysis, the string predominantly fits the category of Generalization (<G>):
- The proposition "Religious people reject science" is a sweeping assertion without specific justification or acknowledgment of nuance, suggesting that it is making a generalization.

### Conclusion
Therefore, the string "Are you one of those stupid religious people that reject science?" is classified as a type <G> defective argument, which is a Generalization.
