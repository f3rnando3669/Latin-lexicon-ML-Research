For 
To apply IDAA to the string "My roommate from Maine loves lobsters, therefore all people from Maine love lobsters," we'll need to decompose the task of classifying the defective argument (IDA) into specific steps (D). Here's a step-by-step step breakdown:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)

First, we identify the proposition (<P>) in the argument. A proposition is a statement summarizing what we intend to prove.

**Proposition (<P>):** "All people from Maine love lobsters."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)

Next, we identify the reason (<R>) provided to support the proposition. The reason sets forth the causal basis establishing the truth of the proposition.

**Reason (<R>):** "My roommate from Maine loves lobsters."

### Step 3: Classify the Defective Argument (IDA)
Now we need to classify the defective argument type by analyzing the <P> and <R>. We'll determine which of the defective argument types <s> falls under.

- **Generalization (G):** Assertion based on a small part or majority but generalized to all.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** Claim of complete enumeration while missing some possibilities.
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** Reason does not conclusively support the proposition.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** Reason with a weak causal basis.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** Reason merely repeats the proposition.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** Assumed proof based on presumed universal agreement.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** Proof can be taken differently than intended.

Given the analysis:
- The proposition "All people from Maine love lobsters" is based on the fact that one individual from Maine (the roommate) loves lobsters.
- This is a classic case of overgeneralization, where a conclusion about an entire group is based on evidence from a single member of that group.

**Defective Argument Classification: Generalization (G)**

### Step 4: Confirm the Classification
To ensure the classification is accurate, we'll confirm that other defective argument types do not apply as convincingly as Generalization.

- **FE (Incomplete Enumeration):** Not applicable, as this argument isn't claiming complete possibilities.
- **IR (Inconclusive Reason):** The reason is not just inconclusive; it is overgeneralized.
- **WCB (Insufficient Causal Basis):** The reason isn't just weak due to insufficient cause; it leads to a faulty generalization.
- **RR (Faulty Repetition of Proposition):** The reason is not repeating the proposition itself.
- **FU (Presumptuous Consensus):** No assumption based on universal agreement.
- **DEP (Ambiguous Language Use):** The language of the proof is not ambiguous.

### Conclusion
The defective argument type for the string "My roommate from Maine loves lobsters, therefore all people from Maine love lobsters" is **Generalization (G)**.

This completes the application of IDAA to the provided string, step-by-step.
