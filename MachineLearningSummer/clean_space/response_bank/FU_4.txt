For 
Let's apply the step-by-step process defined by <IDAA> to the phrase "Ninety percent of all people surveyed said that McDonalds is better than Burger King so it must be true." to identify which type of defective argument it represents.

**Step 1: Understand the Argument**
- Main proposition: "McDonalds is better than Burger King."
- Supporting claim: "Ninety percent of all people surveyed said so."

**Step 2: Identify Defective Argument Patterns**
- Check if it fits any defective argument patterns:
  - <G>: Does it generalize based on a specific instance?
  - <FE>: Does it list fewer or more options than actually exist?
  - <IR>: Does it provide a reason that doesn't logically support the proposition?
  - <RR>: Does it restate the proposition in other words?
  - <WCB>: Does it offer a reason that is not compelling enough to support the proposition?
  - <FU>: Does it assert universally agreed points without proof?
  - <DEP>: Does it use statements open to dual interpretations?

**Step 3: Analyze Specific Indicators**
- The supporting claim relies on the popularity or consensus (ninety percent of people) to assert the truth of the proposition.
- It suggests that because many people believe McDonald's is better, it must be true.
- This specific structure suggests an appeal to the majority or bandwagon fallacy, which aligns with the defective argument type <FU> (asserting universally agreed points without proof).

**Step 4: Match Argument to Defective Type**
- The characteristics of appealing to the majority opinion without independent proof of truth align with <FU>.
- Therefore, the argument is a <FU> type.

**Step 5: Validate and Document**
- Review the argument to ensure it fits the criteria for <FU>.
  - It relies on a consensus or majority opinion to assert an objective truth without providing independent evidence.
- Document: "The argument 'Ninety percent of all people surveyed said that McDonalds is better than Burger King so it must be true.' is identified as a <FU> type defective argument due to its appeal to the majority (bandwagon fallacy) and making an unchecked assumption that the majority opinion equates to truth."

By following this structured decomposition process, we've identified that the given argument is a <FU> type defective argument.
