For 
To apply the decomposed steps (<D>) to identify the type of defective argument (<IDA>) in the string <s>:

### Example String (s)
"Every time I go to sleep the sun goes down. Therefore, my sleeping causes the sun to set."

### Decomposition of <IDA> (<D>)

1. **Parsing the Statement**:
   - Proposition: "My sleeping causes the sun to set."
   - Supporting Observation: "Every time I go to sleep the sun goes down."

2. **Identifying Key Features**:
   - Correlation is being used to imply causation.
   - The statement makes an assumption of a direct causal relationship.

3. **Comparative Analysis**:
   - Does the observation logically support the proposition that sleeping causes the sun to set?
   - No, it merely points out a coincidence without establishing a causal link.

4. **Reason Validation**:
   - The observation that the sun goes down every time one goes to sleep lacks a logical causal mechanism linking sleeping to the setting of the sun. It's an erroneous attribution of cause based on temporal correlation.

5. **Dual Interpretability Check**:
   - The statement does not offer a dual interpretation that supports or undermines its proposition.

6. **Categorization**:
   - The reason provided is irrelevant to the actual cause-and-effect relationship. Thus, the argument fits the definition of <IR> (Irrelevant reason).

### Final Identification: <IR>

Based on the decomposition and structured steps, we identify the defective argument type in the given string as <IR> (Irrelevant reason).

### Summary

- **Parsing the Statement**: Analyzed the proposition and supporting observation.
- **Identifying Key Features**: Correlation implying causation and lack of logical link.
- **Comparative Analysis**: Recognized the irrelevance of the observation to the proposition.
- **Reason Validation**: Established that the reason does not logically support the proposition.
- **Dual Interpretability Check**: Confirmed no dual meaning affecting the analysis.
- **Categorization**: Categorized the argument as <IR>. 

The string "Every time I go to sleep the sun goes down. Therefore, my sleeping causes the sun to set." exemplifies an irrelevant reason (<IR>) defection type, as it erroneously implies causation where there is only a coincidental correlation.
