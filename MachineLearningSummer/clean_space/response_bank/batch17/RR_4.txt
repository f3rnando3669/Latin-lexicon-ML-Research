For 
Let's apply the step-by-step decomposition of <IDAA> to the string "That restaurant is popular because everyone in town goes there."

### Step-by-Step Decomposition for <IDAA>:

1. **Identify Key Features of Each Argument Type:**
   - **Generalization (<G>):** Broadly applying a specific instance to the general population or scenario.
   - **False Enumeration (<FE>):** Presenting a limited or skewed set of options compared to the reality.
   - **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>):** Providing reasons that don’t logically support the premise.
   - **Redundant Reason (<RR>):** Presenting reasons that are rephrasings of the original proposition.
   - **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>):** Presenting a weak or uncompelling cause-and-effect relationship.
   - **False Universals (<FU>):** Asserting universal agreement or popularity without proof.
   - **Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>):** Using phrases with dual interpretations that could undermine the argument.

2. **Examine <s> and Extract Specific Qualities:**
   - Read the given string carefully: "That restaurant is popular because everyone in town goes there."
   - Annotate the string for statements or phrases that match the features identified in Step 1.
     - Core assertion: "That restaurant is popular..."
     - Reason given: "...because everyone in town goes there."

3. **Match the Extracted Qualities to Argument Types:**
   - The argument asserts that popularity (a general quality) is due to everyone in town going there (a claim of universality).
   - This suggests the argument type might involve False Universals (<FU>), as it leans on the idea that if everyone does it, it must be true.

4. **Verify Logical Consistency:**
   - Check each part of the argument for alignment with the defective argument definitions:
     - The reason provided (“everyone in town goes there”) is used to support the claim that the restaurant is popular. This reasoning appeals to the popularity or belief of the populace without offering substantial proof.
     - The statement assumes a universal agreement which is presented as a validation.

5. **Final Classification:**
   - Based on the analysis, the string "That restaurant is popular because everyone in town goes there." fits the description of **False Universals (FU)**.
     - **Reason:** The argument depends on the premise that universal behavior or belief (everyone in town goes there) validates the popularity of the restaurant. It asserts the popularity as a universally agreed upon fact without additional proof.

### Conclusion:
The string "That restaurant is popular because everyone in town goes there." is classified as **<FU>** (False Universals), as it implies a universal agreement to support its claim without substantive evidence.
