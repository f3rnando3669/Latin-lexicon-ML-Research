For 
Let's apply the decomposed steps of IDAA to classify the string "My best friend says you’re a liar, so I’m not going to talk to you."

### Step-by-Step Decomposition and Application:

#### Step 1: Understand the Defective Argument Types
- **G (Generalization)**: Claims a general truth based on a specific instance.
- **FE (False Enumeration)**: Lists fewer or more options than actually exist.
- **IR (Inappropriate Reason)**: Provides a reason that doesn't logically support the proposition.
- **RR (Redundant Reason)**: Offers a reason that repeats the proposition using different words.
- **WCB (Weak Causal Basis)**: Provides a causal explanation that isn't compelling enough.
- **FU (False Universals)**: Asserts universally agreed points without proof.
- **DEP (Double-Edged Phrases)**: Uses statements open to dual interpretations.

#### Step 2: Break Down the Criteria
Identify a checklist for each defective argument type:
- **G (Generalization)**: Broad claim based on a limited instance.
- **FE (False Enumeration)**: Binary choice when more alternatives exist.
- **IR (Inappropriate Reason)**: Reason does not logically support the conclusion.
- **RR (Redundant Reason)**: Reason using different wording to repeat the proposition.
- **WCB (Weak Causal Basis)**: Unconvincing causal relationship.
- **FU (False Universals)**: Claims universally agreed points without proof.
- **DEP (Double-Edged Phrases)**: Statement open to dual interpretations.

#### Step 3: Preprocess the Input String
- Strip unnecessary punctuation: The string appears already clean.
- Convert to lowercase for uniformity:
    ``` "my best friend says you’re a liar, so i’m not going to talk to you." ```
- Identify key components:
    - Subject: "my best friend"
    - Claim: "says you’re a liar"
    - Consequence: "so i’m not going to talk to you"

#### Step 4: Match Predefined Criteria with Input String
- **Generalization**: Does this claim a general truth based on a specific instance? No.
- **False Enumeration**: Are only some options listed when more exist? No.
- **Inappropriate Reason**: Does the reason not logically support the conclusion? Yes.
    - The string is providing the reason that "My best friend says you’re a liar" to support the action of "I’m not going to talk to you." The reason provided is based on hearsay and does not logically support the decision not to talk to the person. It presumes that the best friend's claim directly implies the conclusion without proper evidence.
- **Redundant Reason**: Is the reason essentially the same as the proposition? No.
- **Weak Causal Basis**: Is the cause not compelling enough to support the conclusion? Partially, but it fits better under inappropriate reasoning.
- **False Universals**: Does it assert a universally agreed point without proof? No.
- **Double-Edged Phrases**: Is the statement open to dual interpretations? No.

#### Step 5: Classify the Input String
Based on the analysis, the string "My best friend says you’re a liar, so I’m not going to talk to you" best fits:
- **IR (Inappropriate Reason)**: Because the reason provided is based on an unverified claim and does not logically support the proposition of not talking to the person.

#### Step 6: Validate the Classification (Optional)
- This step is optional but might involve peer review or additional scrutiny. For now, given the logical breakdown, the classification of **Inappropriate Reason (IR)** is clear and robust.

### Conclusion
The string "My best friend says you’re a liar, so I’m not going to talk to you" is classified as type:
- **IR (Inappropriate Reason)**
