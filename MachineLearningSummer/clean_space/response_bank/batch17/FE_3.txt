For 
To apply <IDAA> to the string "People either like coffee or hate it.", we will follow the structured decomposition and classification process as defined.

### Step 1: Understanding <t> (Advanced Task)
- **<t> for <IDA>:** The task is to classify the given string <s> "People either like coffee or hate it." as one of the specified defective argument types: <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>.

### Step 2: Decomposition of <t> (Breaking down the task into steps)
- **Decomposition <D> for <IDA>:**
  1. **Identify Argument Type Keywords**: Look for keywords and indicators in the string <s> that align with the definitions provided.
  2. **Match Against Definitions**: Compare the characteristics of the string <s> with each defective argument type definition.
  3. **Evaluate Logical Structure**: Analyze the logical structure of the argument in the string to see which type it fits into.
  4. **Assign Classification**: Based on the above analysis, classify the string <s> into one of <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>.

### Step 3: Applying the Steps to <s>
Let's classify the string "People either like coffee or hate it."

1. **Identify Argument Type Keywords**: 
   - "People either like coffee..."
   - "...or hate it."

2. **Match Against Definitions**:
   - Is this an instance of **Generalization (G)**? No, it does not generalize a general truth based on a specific instance.
   - Is this a **False Enumeration (FE)**? Yes, it presents only two options ("like coffee" or "hate coffee") while ignoring potentially other valid possibilities like being indifferent to coffee.
   - Is this an **Inappropriate Reason (IR)**? No, it does not provide a reason for a proposition.
   - Is this a **Redundant Reason (RR)**? No, the reason is not a restatement of the proposition.
   - Is this a **Weak Causal Basis (WCB)**? No, it does not offer a causal basis.
   - Is this a **False Universal (FU)**? No, it does not use universally agreed points without proof.
   - Is this a **Double-Edged Phrase (DEP)**? No, it is not open to dual interpretations.

3. **Evaluate Logical Structure**:
   - The string presents an either/or situation, suggesting there are only two possible stances toward coffee, ignoring other possibilities.

4. **Assign Classification**:
   - Based on the definitions, this is a **False Enumeration (FE)**.

### Conclusion
Therefore, applying the decomposition steps to the task <IDA> with the string "People either like coffee or hate it.", we classify it as **<FE>**.

This completes the application of <D> to <IDA>, effectively performing <IDAA>.
