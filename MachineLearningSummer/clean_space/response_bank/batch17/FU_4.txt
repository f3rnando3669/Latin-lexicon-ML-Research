For 
Sure, let's apply the step-by-step process of <IDAA> to the statement "Everyone else is doing it, so should you."

### Step-by-Step Breakdown (<IDAA> applied to "Everyone else is doing it, so should you")

#### 1. Preprocessing and Initial Analysis:
   - **String (s)**: "Everyone else is doing it, so should you."
   - Key terms: "Everyone else", "doing it", "so should you."

#### 2. Category Identification:
   - **Check for Generalization (<G>)**:
     - No indications of sweeping generalizations. It's not making a general truth claim but suggests an action based on others' behavior.
   
   - **Check for False Enumeration (<FE>)**:
     - The statement isn’t limiting options but persuading based on others’ actions.
   
   - **Check for Inappropriate Reason (<IR>)**:
     - It's providing a reason (others are doing it), which seems inappropriate as it appeals to popularity rather than logic.
   
   - **Check for Redundant Reason (<RR>)**:
     - The reason given here is not redundantly restating the proposition, so it doesn't fit <RR>.
   
   - **Check for Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>)**:
     - Not about a causal basis.
   
   - **Check for False Universals (<FU>)**:
     - The phrase "Everyone else" suggests universally agreed-upon points without proof. It appeals to popularity to validate the action.
   
   - **Check for Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>)**:
     - No ambiguous dual interpretations present.

#### 3. Detailed Analysis:
   - **Evaluate Checking for False Universals (<FU>)**:
     - **Known examples of <FU>**:
       - "Mormonism is one of the fastest growing sects of Christianity today so that whole story about Joseph Smith getting the golden plates that, unfortunately, disappeared back into heaven, must be true!"
       - "You appealed to popularity or the fact that many people do something as an attempted form of validation."
     - **Comparison**:
       - The statement "Everyone else is doing it, so should you" fits the pattern of appealing to a popularly held action to justify the recommended behavior.
   
   - **Evaluate Checking for Inappropriate Reason (<IR>)**:
     - **Known examples of <IR>**:
       - "We cannot listen to John’s opinion on global warming because he is a tree hugger."
     - **Comparison**:
       - The reasoning that everyone else is doing something does not logically support the action one should take, making the reason inappropriate logically.

#### 4. Classification:
   - **Primary defective argument type**: 
     - **False Universals (<FU>)**: Appeals to the fact that everyone else is doing something as the validation for why one should do it, fitting the appeal to popularity.
     - **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>)**: Provides a reason that doesn't logically support the proposition (appeal to popularity).

#### 5. Verification and Feedback:
   - Double-check:
     - Review the statement: It indeed uses the behavior of others as validation for why one should follow suit.
     - Confirm: Though <IR> appears relevant, <FU> is a more precise classification given the appeal to universal behavior without proof.

#### 6. Documentation:
   - Document:
     - Original String: "Everyone else is doing it, so should you."
     - Classified as: <FU> (False Universals).
     - Reasoning: The statement appeals to the popularity of an action to justify doing the same, without providing logical proof or reasoning, fitting the criteria for False Universals.

This systematic approach confirms that "Everyone else is doing it, so should you" is best classified under the defective argument type <FU> (False Universals).
