For 
Sure, I will apply the step-by-step breakdown (<IDAA>) to the given string "Encourages the audience to become part of a group or act because other people are acting in the same way."

### Application of Decomposition to <IDA> (IDAA)

Given <s>: "Encourages the audience to become part of a group or act because other people are acting in the same way."

1. **Identify the core claim or proposition:**
   - The core proposition is that the audience should become part of a group or act in a certain way.

2. **Assess the support provided for this core claim:**
   - The support provided is the fact that other people are already acting in that way.

3. **Evaluate the nature of the support in relation to the claim:**
   - The support relies on the idea that because others are doing something, the audience should do it as well. This is an appeal to common behavior or popularity without providing additional evidence or logical reasoning.

4. **Match the faulty reasoning to the defined defective argument types:**
   - The argument asserts that something should be done because many people are doing it. This is effectively relying on the notion of universally agreed points or behaviors without additional proof.

5. **Classify the argument:**
   - Based on the evaluation, this argument matches the type <FU> (False Universals).

Thus, the given string <s> "Encourages the audience to become part of a group or act because other people are acting in the same way." would be classified as <FU>.
