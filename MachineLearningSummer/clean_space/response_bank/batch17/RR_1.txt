For 
Let's apply the defined steps of <IDAA> to classify the given string "Paranormal activity is real because I have experienced what can only be described as paranormal activity."

**Step-by-Step Execution:**

1. **Step 1: Understand the Definitions**  
   Review each defective argument type for accurate understanding:
   - **<G>:** Generalization
   - **<FE>:** False Enumeration
   - **<IR>:** Inappropriate Reason
   - **<RR>:** Redundant Reason
   - **<WCB>:** Weak Causal Basis
   - **<FU>:** False Universals
   - **<DEP>:** Double-Edged Phrases

2. **Step 2: Analyze the Given String (<s>)**  
   The string makes the claim "Paranormal activity is real" and provides the reasoning "because I have experienced what can only be described as paranormal activity."

3. **Step 3: Identify Key Features in the String**  
   The key feature here is the reasoning that repeats the claim in slightly different words.

4. **Step 4: Match Features to Definitions**  
   The reasoning given ("because I have experienced what can only be described as paranormal activity") essentially restates the proposition ("Paranormal activity is real") without providing new information or a different reason. 

5. **Step 5: Classify the String (<s>)**  
   The repetition of the proposition using different words suggests that this is a *Redundant Reason (RR)* argument.

6. **Step 6: Verify the Classification**  
   Recheck the string against the definition of <RR>:
   - **<RR>:** When it appears to be presented as a new reason but says the same thing as the proposition using different words.
   Applying this, the reasoning does not provide new evidence but rather restates the claim, thus making it a redundant reason.

Final classification for the given string "Paranormal activity is real because I have experienced what can only be described as paranormal activity." is **<RR>**.
