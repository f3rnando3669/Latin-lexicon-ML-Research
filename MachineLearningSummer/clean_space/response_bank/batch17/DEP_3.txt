Let's apply the advanced task analysis <IDAA> step-by-step to the statement: 

"I see nobody on the road," said Alice.
"I only wish I had such eyes," the king remarked..."To be able to see Nobody! And at that distance, too! Why it's as much as I can do to see real people, by this light."

### Step 1: Understand Definitions
Review and understand the definitions of each defective argument type: 
- <G>: Generalization 
- <FE>: False Enumeration 
- <IR>: Inappropriate Reason 
- <RR>: Redundant Reason 
- <WCB>: Weak Causal Basis 
- <FU>: False Universals 
- <DEP>: Double-Edged Phrases 

### Step 2: Identify Key Features
Extract key characteristics:
- **<G>**: Broad conclusion based on specific instances.
- **<FE>**: Presents limited or exaggerated set of options.
- **<IR>**: Reason doesn’t logically support the proposition.
- **<RR>**: New reasoning restates the proposition.
- **<WCB>**: Weak causal link.
- **<FU>**: Claims universally agreed points without proof.
- **<DEP>**: Phrases open to dual interpretations.

### Step 3: Analyze the Statement
Break down the statement:
- Alice says, "I see nobody on the road."
- The King humorously responds, "I only wish I had such eyes...To be able to see Nobody..."
- The King is interpreting "Nobody" as a visible entity, leading to a playful paradox.

### Step 4: Match Features to Types
Compare the features:
- The King’s response hinges on the dual interpretation "seeing Nobody" which creates a humorous paradox.
- The statement appears to carry double meaning:
  - Literal: Alice sees no people.
  - Humorous: The King imagines "Nobody" as a visible entity.

### Step 5: Apply Criteria
Verify whether the statements fit the key markers:
- It uses language that can be interpreted in multiple ways, potentially open to dual interpretations resulting in a paradox or joke.

### Step 6: Final Classification
Determine the most fitting category:
- The dialogue primarily uses a phrase that is open to more than one interpretation, creating a humorous paradox due to dual meaning.

Thus, the statement should be classified as <DEP> (Double-Edged Phrases).

### Final Classification
"I see nobody on the road," said Alice.
"I only wish I had such eyes," the king remarked..."To be able to see Nobody! And at that distance, too! Why it's as much as I can do to see real people, by this light."

Classified as: **<DEP> (Double-Edged Phrases)**
