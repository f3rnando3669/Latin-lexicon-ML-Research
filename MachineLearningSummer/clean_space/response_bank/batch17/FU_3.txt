Sure, let's apply the steps of IDAA to classify the given string: "Officer, I was only driving as fast as everyone around me. I'm sure I wasn't speeding."

### Steps for Decomposition (D)

1. **Understand Definitions**: Ensure clear understanding of the definitions and characteristics of each defective argument type.
2. **Initial Read**: Read the given string carefully.
3. **Identify Key Elements**: Extract key phrases or elements from the string that are indicative of specific argument types.
4. **Match Characteristics**: Compare the extracted elements with the defining characteristics and examples of each defective argument type.
5. **Elimination**: Eliminate argument types that do not match the string.
6. **Final Comparison**: Narrow down to one or two possible argument types, and compare again for the best match.
7. **Classify**: Assign the defective argument type that most accurately describes the string.

### Application of Decomposed Steps to IDA (IDAA)

#### Example String for Classification: 
"Officer, I was only driving as fast as everyone around me. I'm sure I wasn't speeding."

**Step 1: Understand Definitions**
- Generalization (G)
- False Enumeration (FE)
- Inappropriate Reason (IR)
- Redundant Reason (RR)
- Weak Causal Basis (WCB)
- False Universals (FU)
- Double-Edged Phrases (DEP)

**Step 2: Initial Read**
- Carefully read the string: "Officer, I was only driving as fast as everyone around me. I'm sure I wasn't speeding."

**Step 3: Identify Key Elements**
- Key elements: "only driving as fast as everyone around me" and "I'm sure I wasn't speeding."

**Step 4: Match Characteristics**
- **Generalization (G)**: Needs an unwarranted broad statement based on a specific instance.
- **False Enumeration (FE)**: Needs a restricted or expanded set of options.
- **Inappropriate Reason (IR)**: Involves providing a reason that doesn't logically support the proposition.
- **Redundant Reason (RR)**: Restates the proposition with no new information.
- **Weak Causal Basis (WCB)**: Involves a weak causal link.
- **False Universals (FU)**: Attempts to establish a point by appealing to universal belief without proof.
- **Double-Edged Phrases (DEP)**: Phrases that can be interpreted in two ways, potentially against the speaker.

**Step 5: Elimination**
- **False Enumeration (FE)**: Not listing options.
- **Redundant Reason (RR)**: Not restating the proposition.
- **Weak Causal Basis (WCB)**: Not specifically causal.
- **Double-Edged Phrases (DEP)**: No dual interpretations here.
- **Generalization (G)**: Not a broad statement based on a specific instance.

**Step 6: Final Comparison**
- **False Universals (FU)**: Argument appeals to universal behavior ("everyone around me was driving fast").
- **Inappropriate Reason (IR)**: Argument provides an illogical reason â€” the speed of others does not justify one's own speeding.

**Step 7: Classify**
- The string exhibits characteristics of **False Universals (FU)** because it uses the behavior of others ("everyone around me") to validate not speeding.
- It can also be seen as **Inappropriate Reason (IR)** because the reason for not being considered as speeding (others' driving speed) does not logically support the proposition.

In this instance, the argument most strongly aligns with **False Universals (FU)** as the primary mechanism being employed is the appeal to universal behavior to justify the action.

So, the classification <s> = "Officer, I was only driving as fast as everyone around me. I'm sure I wasn't speeding." would be of argument type <FU>.
