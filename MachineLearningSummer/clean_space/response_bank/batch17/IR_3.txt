For 
Let's apply <IDAA> to the provided string:

**String <s>:** "Perhaps the most classic example of this fallacy is the argument for the existence of God.  Due to the understanding of nature through science, many of the arguments that used to be used for God (or gods) were abandoned, only to be replaced with new ones, usually involving questions to which science has not definitively answered yet.  The move from creationism to intelligent design is a prime example.  Currently the origin of life is a popular argument for God (although a classic argument from ignorance), and an area where we very well may have a scientific answer in the next decade, at which time, the 'origin of life' argument will fade away and be replaced by another, thus moving the figurative goalposts farther back as our understanding of the natural world increases. Exception: This fallacy should not be confused with an argument or set of arguments, with multiple propositions inherent in the argument.  The reason for the difference between this kind of argument and the moving the goalposts fallacy is a subtle one but indicated by a strong initial claim ('has to be', 'must', 'required for', etc.) that gets answered and/or what appears to be ad hoc objections that follow eventually leading to an impossible request for proof.
Fun Fact: The name 'moving the goalposts' comes from the analogy of kicking a perfect field goal in American football, only to have the goalposts be moved on you. This would be very unfair.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition of <IDAA>:

1. **Identify the Argument Structure in <s>**:
   - The string is discussing a logical fallacy known as "moving the goalposts," using the argument for the existence of God as a central example.
   - The main claim seems to focus on the nature of the fallacy and how it changes over time as science answers more questions.

2. **Recognize Key Features and Indicators**:
   - The argument highlights that arguments for God's existence evolve over time as science provides new answers.
   - It mentions how arguments transition (e.g., from creationism to intelligent design).
   - It also explains the concept of "moving the goalposts."
   - The string mentions the fallacy involves creating new criteria when initial claims are addressed.

3. **Compare Features Against Definitions**:
   - **<G> (Generalization)**: Not applicable here; the argument doesn't generalize based on a specific instance.
   - **<FE> (False Enumeration)**: Not applicable; it doesn’t limit options or create a false dichotomy.
   - **<IR> (Inappropriate Reason)**: Not quite; the argument’s reasons seem logically connected to the claim about shifting arguments for God's existence.
   - **<RR> (Redundant Reason)**: Not applicable; the argument isn't simply restating the same thing in different words.
   - **<WCB> (Weak Causal Basis)**: Although the effectiveness of the argument about science eroding religious claims can be debated, it’s not clearly tied to a weak causal basis as defined.
   - **<FU> (False Universals)**: There are no universal claims without evidence here.
   - **<DEP> (Double-Edged Phrases)**: Not directly applicable, although parts of the argument could be interpreted in multiple ways, the main structure is specific.

4. **Assign Defective Argument Type**:
   - Given none of the defective argument types precisely match, it seems like the string is explaining a logical fallacy rather than committing one of the defined defective argument types by itself.

### Conclusion:
- The provided string is an explanation and illustration of a logical fallacy (moving the goalposts) rather than an example of a defective argument as per the types <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>.
- Therefore, it does not fit neatly into any of the defined defective argument types.
