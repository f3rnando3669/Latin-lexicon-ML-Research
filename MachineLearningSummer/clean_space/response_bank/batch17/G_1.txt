For 
Let's apply the decomposition of the task <IDA> (classifying defective argument types) to the given argument step by step:

**Argument:**
"I heard that the Catholic Church was involved in a sex scandal cover-up. Therefore, my 102-year-old Catholic neighbor, who frequently attends Church, is guilty as well!"

**Step 1: Identify the Proposition**
- Proposition: The 102-year-old Catholic neighbor is guilty of being involved in a sex scandal cover-up.

**Step 2: Analyze the Reasoning**
- Reasoning: The argument suggests that because some members of the Catholic Church were involved in a scandal, the specific individual (the 102-year-old neighbor) must also be guilty.

**Step 3: Match Characteristics**
- The argument takes a specific instance (the involvement of the Catholic Church in a scandal) and generalizes it to apply to all members, including the specific neighbor.
- This appears to be an overgeneralization from specific instances to a wider group, then applying it to an individual without evidence specific to that individual.

**Step 4: Classify the Argument**
- After analyzing, this fits the characteristics of <G> (Generalization). The argument makes a broad claim about all Catholics based on the actions of some and then attributes that generalization to a specific individual.

**Step 5: Verify the Classification**
- Ensure the argument does not fit other defective argument types:
  - <FE>: Not listing options or oversimplifying choices.
  - <IR>: Not providing an irrelevant reason but misapplying a generalization.
  - <RR>: Not a redundant reason.
  - <WCB>: Not providing a weak causal relationship.
  - <FU>: Not making a false universal claim in the sense defined.
  - <DEP>: Not using double-edged phrases.
- The argument does not fit as appropriately under any other category as it does under <G>.

**Step 6: Document the Classification**
- Documentation: The argument "I heard that the Catholic Church was involved in a sex scandal cover-up. Therefore, my 102-year-old Catholic neighbor, who frequently attends Church, is guilty as well!" is classified as <G> (Generalization).

In conclusion, following the systematic steps of <IDAA>, we can classify this argument as a Generalization (<G>).
