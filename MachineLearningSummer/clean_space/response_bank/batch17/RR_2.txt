To apply the step-by-step decomposition (IDAA) to the given example, we will follow the outlined procedure meticulously.

### Example String: "We need to fix our broken judicial system by electing new people."

#### 1. Identify the Structure of the Argument:

- **Premise:** The judicial system is broken.
- **Conclusion:** Electing new people will fix the judicial system.

#### 2. Match the Argument to Known Patterns:

- **Keywords/Indicators:**
  - The argument suggests a solution (electing new people) as the way to fix a problem (broken judicial system).
  - The relationship between the problem and the proposed solution is crucial to determine the type of defective argument.

#### 3. Evaluate the Logic of the Argument:

- **Logical Fallacy Check:**
  - The argument does not provide a logical reason why electing new people would necessarily fix the broken judicial system. The proposed solution seems to rely on an assumption rather than a clear, logical connection.
  - It suggests an Inappropriate Reason, as the solution does not directly address how the new people would specifically fix the judicial system.

#### 4. Classify Based on Detected Deficiency:

- **Type of Defective Argument:** The logical deficiency here aligns with the Inappropriate Reason (<IR>) because the reason given (electing new people) does not logically support the conclusion (fixing the judicial system).

### Conclusion of IDAA

- **Classified Defective Argument Type:** <IR>

By following these steps systematically, we can classify the argument type for the given string:

**"We need to fix our broken judicial system by electing new people."** aligns with the defective argument type **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>)**.
