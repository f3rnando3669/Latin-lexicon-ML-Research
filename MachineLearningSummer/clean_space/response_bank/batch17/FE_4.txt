Sure, let's apply the decomposition steps of the classification task (IDAA) to the string "I thought you were a good person, but you weren’t in class today."

### Step-by-Step Decomposition for Classifying Defective Argument Types (IDAA)

#### Step 1: Understanding the Types of Defective Arguments
**Done.**

#### Step 2: Initial Analysis of the String
- *Main Proposition:* The interlocutor is not a good person.
- *Reasoning/Evidence Provided:* The interlocutor wasn't in class today.

#### Step 3: Matching Against Argument Types
- **Generalization (<G>):** This claim isn't generalizing a single instance to a general truth. It's focused on personal behavior.
- **False Enumeration (<FE>):** There is no listing of options.
- **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>):** The reason given for not being a good person is not attending class, which doesn't logically prove the proposition.
- **Redundant Reason (<RR>):** The reason is not merely a rephrasing of the proposition.
- **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>):** It's more about connecting unrelated instances rather than a weak causal basis.
- **False Universals (<FU>):** The claim does not depend on universally agreed points without proof.
- **Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>):** The statement doesn’t present dual interpretations.

#### Step 4: Classifying the String
Based on the characteristics:
- The reason given ("you weren’t in class today") does not logically support the proposition ("not a good person").
- Therefore, this matches with **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>)**.

#### Step 5: Verification
Check again:
- **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>):** The reasoning provided (absence in class) doesn't logically support the claim (moral character).
- Yes, the reasoning does not adequately justify the proposition.

Thus, the classification of the string "I thought you were a good person, but you weren’t in class today." is confirmed as **<IR>**.

By following these steps, we have successfully decomposed and carried out the task of classifying the defective argument type as **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>)**.
