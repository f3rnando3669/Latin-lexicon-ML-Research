For 
Let's apply the step-by-step decomposition of <IDA> (i.e., <IDAA>) to classify the string "You either support Hillary Clinton for President or you don't believe in women's rights."

### Step-by-Step Decomposition of <IDA> (i.e., <IDAA>):

#### Step 1: Understanding the Definitions
Familiarize yourself with the specific characteristics and examples of each defective argument type:
- **Generalization (<G>)**: Claims a general truth based on a specific instance.
- **False Enumeration (<FE>)**: Lists fewer or more options than actually exist.
- **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>)**: Provides a reason that doesn't logically support the proposition.
- **Redundant Reason (<RR>)**: Repeats the proposition using different words.
- **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: Offers an unconvincing causal basis for the proposition.
- **False Universals (<FU>)**: Asserts universally agreed points without proof.
- **Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>)**: Uses statements open to dual interpretations.

#### Step 2: Initial Classification of the String
Analyze <s> and identify obvious indicators or keywords to initially classify it into one of the categories. 

Initial observation of the string: "You either support Hillary Clinton for President or you don't believe in women's rights."

#### Step 3: Detailed Analysis
Examine <s> in detail to confirm or refute the initial classification:
- **Generalization (<G>)**: Does the string claim a general truth based on a specific instance? No, it doesn't make a generalization from a specific instance.
- **False Enumeration (<FE>)**: Does the string list fewer or more options than actually exist?
  - Yes, it presents a binary choice: either you support Hillary Clinton, or you don't believe in women's rights. This is a classic example of presenting an either/or situation where more nuanced options likely exist.
- **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>)**: Does the reason logically support the proposition? This condition isn’t primarily about the logical support of the proposition in this context.
- **Redundant Reason (<RR>)**: Does the string repeat the proposition? No, it doesn't repeat the proposition using different words.
- **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: Does it provide an uncompelling causal basis? No, it's more about listing limited choices.
- **False Universals (<FU>)**: Does it assert universally agreed points without proof? This isn’t a universal assertion but rather a limited enumeration.
- **Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>)**: Is the statement open to dual interpretations? While it might be polarizing, it isn’t an instance of a phrase open to dual interpretations.

#### Step 4: Validation
Cross-check <s> with examples and definitions to ensure the chosen category accurately represents the argument type.

Given our detailed analysis, it is evident that the statement "You either support Hillary Clinton for President or you don't believe in women's rights":
- Fits the definition of **False Enumeration (<FE>)**: It provides fewer options than actually exist by presenting a false dichotomy.

#### Step 5: Conclusion
Finalize the classification of <s> based on the detailed analysis and validation.

**Conclusion**: The string "You either support Hillary Clinton for President or you don't believe in women's rights" is best classified as **False Enumeration (<FE>)**.
