Sure, let's apply the step-by-step decomposition of the task <IDA> to classify the string "Get Verizon--1 billion people can't be wrong" using the defined procedure <IDAA>.

### Step-by-Step Application (IDAA) to "Get Verizon--1 billion people can't be wrong."

1. **Understanding the Types of Fallacies**:
    - **<G> (Generalization)**: Claims a general truth based on a specific instance.
    - **<FE> (False Enumeration)**: Lists fewer or more options than actually exist.
    - **<IR> (Inappropriate Reason)**: Provides a reason that doesn't logically support the proposition.
    - **<RR> (Redundant Reason)**: Appears to present a new reason but says the same thing as the proposition in different words.
    - **<WCB> (Weak Causal Basis)**: Offers a causal basis that is not compelling enough to support the proposition.
    - **<FU> (False Universals)**: Asserts universally agreed points without proof.
    - **<DEP> (Double-Edged Phrases)**: Uses statements open to dual interpretations.

2. **Initial Analysis**:
    - Read and understand the string <s>: "Get Verizon--1 billion people can't be wrong."

3. **Checking Against Definitions**:
    - **<G>**: Not making a general truth based on specific instances.
    - **<FE>**: Not listing fewer or more options than actually exist.
    - **<IR>**: Not providing an inappropriate reason.
    - **<RR>**: Not repeating the same reasoning in different words.
    - **<WCB>**: Not suggesting a weak causal basis.
    - **<FU>**: Asserts a universally agreed point without proof ("1 billion people can't be wrong").
    - **<DEP>**: Not using dual interpretations.

4. **Identify Patterns**:
    - The statement "1 billion people can't be wrong" suggests appealing to popularity or commonly accepted belief without providing concrete proof.

5. **Classify the Fallacy**:
    - Based on the analysis and identified pattern, the fallacy is classified as <FU> (False Universals).

Therefore, the string "Get Verizon--1 billion people can't be wrong" is of type <FU> (False Universals).

By following this structured, step-by-step method, we have systematically classified the string according to the defined types of logical fallacies.
