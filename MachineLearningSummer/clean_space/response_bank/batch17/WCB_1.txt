For 
To classify the defective argument type of the statement, "The reason Donald Trump got elected was because liberals took political correctness too far," we will apply the step-by-step process (IDAA) as defined earlier.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (D) of IDA:

1. **Identify the Claim and Reasoning**:
    - **Claim**: Donald Trump got elected.
    - **Reasoning**: Because liberals took political correctness too far.

2. **Examine for Generalization (G)**:
    - Not directly applicable. The argument does not make a sweeping statement based on one or a few instances.

3. **Examine for False Enumeration (FE)**:
    - Not directly applicable. The argument does not limit choices or options in this context.

4. **Examine for Inappropriate Reason (IR)**:
    - Potentially applicable. We need to check if the reason directly supports the claim in a logical manner.
    - Upon inspection: "Liberals took political correctness too far" as a reason for Trump's election does not logically or necessarily explain the electoral outcome solely. It does not consider other significant factors such as campaign strategies, economic conditions, etc. This reason may not logically support the election outcome.

5. **Examine for Redundant Reason (RR)**:
    - Not applicable. The reasoning does not simply restate the proposition using different words.

6. **Examine for Weak Causal Basis (WCB)**:
    - Potentially applicable. We need to check if the causal relationship is weak or unconvincing.
    - Upon inspection: The statement suggests a direct causal relationship between liberal political correctness and Trump getting elected, which appears weak and insufficient given the complexity of election dynamics that involve multiple factors.

7. **Examine for False Universals (FU)**:
    - Not directly applicable. The argument does not assert a universally agreed-upon point without proof.

8. **Examine for Double-Edged Phrases (DEP)**:
    - Not applicable. The statement is not open to dual interpretations that could contradict the speakerâ€™s intention.

9. **Classify the Argument**:
    - Based on the examination steps, the appropriate classifications could be either <IR> (Inappropriate Reason) for providing a reason that does not logically support the claim, or <WCB> (Weak Causal Basis) for offering a causal relationship that is not compelling enough.
    - Considering step 4 and step 6 analyses, the most fitting classification is <WCB>.

### Conclusion:
- The statement "The reason Donald Trump got elected was because liberals took political correctness too far" is best classified as <WCB> (Weak Causal Basis). This classification is appropriate because the reasoning provided (liberals taking political correctness too far) does not adequately explain the complex and multifaceted nature of Trump's election outcome.
