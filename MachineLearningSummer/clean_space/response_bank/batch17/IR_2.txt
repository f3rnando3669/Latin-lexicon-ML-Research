For 
Let's apply the decomposition steps (<IDAA>) to the given statement: "In the race for mayor, Lara says a vote for her opponent will lead to you losing your job. What fallacy has she committed?"

### Step-by-Step Application

1. **Identify the Main Proposition**:
   - Main proposition: Voting for Lara's opponent will result in job loss.
   
2. **Evaluate the Specific Instance or Evidence Provided**:
   - Evidence: There is no specific evidence provided that directly explains how voting for Lara's opponent would result in job loss. It’s a claim without a detailed rationale.

3. **Match Characteristics with Defective Argument Types**:
   - Compare with definitions:
     - <G> (Generalization): This doesn't generalize a specific instance to a broader claim.
     - <FE> (False Enumeration): The statement implies a binary choice but primarily focuses on the consequences of one option without listing options inaccurately.
     - <IR> (Inappropriate Reason): The consequence (losing your job) doesn’t logically follow the action (voting for her opponent) without additional reasoning.
     - <RR> (Redundant Reason): The statement doesn’t repeat the proposition in different words.
     - <WCB> (Weak Causal Basis): Suggesting a weak, unconvincing causal link.
     - <FU> (False Universals): The statement doesn’t really assert anything universally agreed upon without proof.
     - <DEP> (Double-Edged Phrases): There’s no dual interpretation present.

4. **Verify Consistency Across Definitions**:
   - The claim that voting for Lara's opponent will lead to job loss doesn’t follow logically without additional context or evidence. 
   - This most closely aligns with <IR> (Inappropriate Reason) since the proposition lacks a logical connection to the given outcome.
   - Could it be <FE> because it implies only one negative outcome? However, it mainly lacks logical support, so it fits better with <IR>.

5. **Provide Justification for Classification**:
   - Classification: <IR> (Inappropriate Reason).
   - Rationale: The statement posits a consequence (losing your job) for voting for Lara’s opponent without providing a logical connection or reason that supports this outcome. The reason given does not logically lead to the proposition.

Thus, the fallacy committed in the statement "In the race for mayor, Lara says a vote for her opponent will lead to you losing your job" is classified under <IR> — Inappropriate Reason.
