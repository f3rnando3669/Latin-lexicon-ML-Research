Sure, let's systematically decompose the task of classifying the given string \(<s>\) "One of our clients doubled their conversions after changing all their landing page text to bright red. Therefore, changing all text to red is a proven way to double conversions." into one of the defective argument types using \(<IDAA>\).

### Step 1: Identify Argument Components
- **Input**: "One of our clients doubled their conversions after changing all their landing page text to bright red. Therefore, changing all text to red is a proven way to double conversions."
- **Action**: 
  - Identify that the argument consists of:
    1. A specific instance: A client doubled their conversions by changing text to bright red.
    2. A general conclusion: Changing all text to red is a proven way to double conversions.

### Step 2: Analyze Argument Structure
- **Input**: Specific instance (client's conversion improvement) and general conclusion (red text proves conversion increase).
- **Action**: 
  - Examine the structure to see if the argument is generalizing from a specific instance to a general claim.

### Step 3: Compare with Definitions
- **Input**: Identified structure from Step 2.
- **Action**: 
  - Compare this structure with the definitions of defective argument types:
    - **<G>**: Claims a general truth based on a specific instance.
    - **<FE>**: Listing fewer or more options than actually exist.
    - **<IR>**: Providing a reason that doesn't logically support the proposition.
    - **<RR>**: Presenting a new reason that says the same thing as the proposition using different words.
    - **<WCB>**: Offering a causal basis that is not compelling enough to support the proposition.
    - **<FU>**: Asserting universally agreed points without proof.
    - **<DEP>**: Using statements open to dual interpretations.

### Step 4: Determine Type
- **Input**: Comparisons made in Step 3.
- **Action**: Match the characteristics of the argument in the string to the closest fitting defective argument type.
  - The argument is making a general claim (that changing all text to red is proven to double conversions) based on a single specific instance (one clientâ€™s experience).

### Step 5: Return Classification
- **Input**: The determined type from Step 4.
- **Action**: Output the identified defective argument type.
  - The argument fits the description of \(<G>\) (Generalization).

### Result:
- **Output**: \(<G>\).

In summary, applying \(<IDAA>\) to the given string, we classify it as a defective argument type \(<G>\) since it claims a general truth (changing text to red always doubles conversions) based on a specific instance (one client's experience).
