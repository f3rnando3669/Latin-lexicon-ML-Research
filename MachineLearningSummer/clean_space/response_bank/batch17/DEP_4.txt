Sure, let's apply the decomposition steps to classify the given string as one of the defective argument types: 

**String <s>: "It is immoral to kill an innocent human being.  Fetuses are innocent human beings.  Therefore, it is immoral to kill fetuses."**

### Step 1: Understand the Task <IDA>
The goal is to classify the string <s> into one of the predefined defective argument types: 
- <G> Generalization
- <FE> False Enumeration
- <IR> Inappropriate Reason
- <RR> Redundant Reason
- <WCB> Weak Causal Basis
- <FU> False Universals
- <DEP> Double-Edged Phrases

### Step 2: Decomposition <D> of the Task <IDA>

#### Step 2.1: Identify Key Features
Identify key words or phrases that hint at specific defective argument types:
- "It is immoral to kill an innocent human being."
- "Fetuses are innocent human beings."
- "Therefore, it is immoral to kill fetuses."

#### Step 2.2: Analyze Structure
Analyze the logical structure and relationship between statements:
1. Premise: "It is immoral to kill an innocent human being."
2. Premise: "Fetuses are innocent human beings."
3. Conclusion: "Therefore, it is immoral to kill fetuses."

The argument is structured as a syllogism, where the conclusion follows from the premises.

#### Step 2.3: Match with Definitions
Match the identified features and structure with the definitions of the defective argument types:
- The argument seems to use a form of logical inference (deductive reasoning).
- It isnâ€™t presenting more or fewer options than necessary (<FE>).
- The reason provided is directly related to the proposition and the logical conclusion follows from the premises, indicating it is not inappropriate (<IR>).
- It does not restate the proposition in a redundant manner (<RR>).
- The causal relationship is direct and straightforward, and thus not a weak causal basis (<WCB>).
- It does not assert universally agreed points (<FU>).
- It does not use statements open to dual interpretations (<DEP>).

#### Step 2.4: Confirm the Classification
Ensure the identified type fits <s> better than other possible types:
- Generalization <G>: The argument starts with a general rule but it uses specific premises to reach a specific conclusion. Hence, it might not fit the <G> category neatly.
- Check again for possible matches, and confirm this argument is more of a syllogism than a general fallacy.

### Final Classification
Given the detailed analysis above, the argument presented does not neatly fit into any of the predefined defective argument types (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>). It appears to be a classical syllogistic argument instead of a fallacious one, assuming the premises are taken at face value as true. 

**Conclusion**: The given string does not fit into any of the provided defective argument categories directly. Instead, it showcases a form of deductive reasoning, which is not a fallacy on its own unless the premises or interpretation is incorrect. In this context, it may be most relevant to discuss the accuracy or validity of the premises rather than classifying it as a defect in reasoning.
