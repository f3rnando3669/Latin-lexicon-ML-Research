For 
To apply <IDAA> to the given string "Since Anna Camacho became vice president of the parent-teacher association, student performance has declined and teacher morale is down. We on the school board believe that Camacho bears sole responsibility for the downtrend.", we will follow the steps outlined in the decomposition of <IDA>.

### Application of <D> to <IDA> (<IDAA>)

#### 1. Step 1: Comprehension
**Statement (s):**
"Since Anna Camacho became vice president of the parent-teacher association, student performance has declined and teacher morale is down. We on the school board believe that Camacho bears sole responsibility for the downtrend."

**Understanding the Argument:**
The argument claims that since Anna Camacho took the position of vice president, there has been a decline in student performance and teacher morale, and the school board attributes all responsibility for this decline to her.

#### 2. Step 2: Categorization
**Identify Core Components:**
- There is a correlation between Anna Camacho's tenure and the decline in performance and morale.
- The argument attributes the sole responsibility for the negative outcomes to Camacho without considering other potential factors.

#### 3. Step 3: Attribution
**Match to a Defective Argument Type:**
- This argument can be seen as an instance of <WCB> (Weak Causal Belief). It is assigning sole responsibility (a narrow causal attribution) to Camacho for the observed decline without sufficiently compelling evidence and without considering other possible causes.

#### 4. Step 4: Justification
**Justify the Match:**
The defective argument type is <WCB> because:
- The statement provides a weak causal attribution by focusing solely on Camacho's position as the cause of the decline.
- It does not consider or discuss any other possible factors that could have contributed to the decline in student performance and teacher morale.
- This lack of thorough consideration makes the causal link between Camacho's role and the declining trends insufficiently compelling.

### Conclusion
Through the steps of <IDAA>, we can identify that the given argument "Since Anna Camacho became vice president of the parent-teacher association, student performance has declined and teacher morale is down. We on the school board believe that Camacho bears sole responsibility for the downtrend." fits the defective argument type <WCB> (Weak Causal Belief).
