For 
Certainly! Let's apply \( <IDAA> \) to the given string "Farmer McDonald: Ever since they put up that new power plant across the river, we haven't had a bit of rain. I'm tellin' you, mankind has got too big for its britches when it fiddles around with nature."

### Step-by-Step \( <IDAA> \):

1. **Identify Context**:
   - The context here is a claim made by Farmer McDonald regarding the lack of rain and the presence of a new power plant across the river.

2. **Determine the Proposition**:
   - The main proposition is: "The new power plant is responsible for the lack of rain."

3. **Evaluate Support Provided**:
    - The support provided for this proposition is: "Ever since they put up that new power plant across the river, we haven't had a bit of rain."
    - Farmer McDonald also makes a broader claim: "mankind has got too big for its britches when it fiddles around with nature."

4. **Classify Argument Type**:
    - The argument suggests a causal relationship between the installation of the power plant and the lack of rain based on temporal correlation alone (i.e., after the power plant was built, rain stopped).
    - This basis for a causal relation is weak because no compelling evidence is provided to support that the power plant is affecting the rainfall.

Hence, the argument falls under \( <WCB> \) (Weak Causal Basis).

### Classification Conclusion:
The string "Farmer McDonald: Ever since they put up that new power plant across the river, we haven't had a bit of rain. I'm tellin' you, mankind has got too big for its britches when it fiddles around with nature." is classified as \( <WCB> \).
