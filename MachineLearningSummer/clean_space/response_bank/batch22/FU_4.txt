For 
To apply the task of <IDAA> to the string "Everyone else is doing it, so should you.", we will follow the step-by-step decomposition of <IDA>:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition of IDA

1. **Identify the Argument:**
   - Extract the core argument from the string <s>. This involves identifying the main statement and the supporting evidence or reasoning provided.

2. **Classify the Argument Type:**
   - Using the definitions provided for each defective argument type, compare the characteristics of the extracted argument from step 1 to determine the appropriate classification.

### Step 1: Identify the Argument

Given the string <s> = "Everyone else is doing it, so should you", we can extract the main proposition and the reasoning provided:

- **Proposition:** You should do something.
- **Reasoning Provided:** Because everyone else is doing it.

### Step 2: Classify the Argument Type

Next, we compare the identified argument against the characteristics of the defective argument types defined as follows:

- **Generalization (G):** Claims a general truth based on a specific instance.
  - Example: "All sports car drivers are too aggressive!"

- **False Enumeration (FE):** Lists fewer or more options than actually exist.
  - Example: "Vote for Smith or live through four more years of higher taxes."

- **Inappropriate Reason (IR):** Provides a reason that doesn't logically support the proposition.
  - Example: "We cannot listen to Johnâ€™s opinion on global warming because he is a tree hugger."

- **Redundant Reason (RR):** When it appears to be presented as a new reason but says the same thing as the proposition using different words.
  - Example: "This legislation is sinful because it is the wrong thing to do."

- **Weak Causal Basis (WCB):** Offers a causal basis that is not compelling enough to support the proposition.
  - Example: "I had a real bad headache, then saw my doctor. Just by talking with him, my headache started to subside, and I was all better the next day. It was well worth the $200 visit fee."

- **False Universals (FU):** Asserting universally agreed points without proof.
  - Examples: "Mormonism is one of the fastest growing sects of Christianity today so that whole story about Joseph Smith getting the golden plates that, unfortunately, disappeared back into heaven, must be true!", "Everybody know that staying out in the rain can make you sick."

- **Double-Edged Phrases (DEP):** Using statements open to dual interpretations, potentially against the speaker.
  - Example: "I want to have myself a merry little Christmas, but I refuse to do as the song suggests and make the yuletide gay. I don't think sexual preference should have anything to do with enjoying the holiday."

From the examples and definitions given, we can analyze the argument "Everyone else is doing it, so should you":

- The argument is attempting to persuade someone to take an action based on the fact that others are doing it. This falls into the category of **False Universals (FU)**, as it is asserting a point (that one should do something) simply because it is perceived as universally agreed or popular, without providing any substantial proof or reasoning beyond the popularity of the action.

### Summary of Application:
1. **Identify the Argument:** Extract "Everyone else is doing it, so should you."
2. **Classify the Argument Type:** Compare with definitions and determine it matches **False Universals (FU)**.

Thus, the string "Everyone else is doing it, so should you." is classified as type <FU>.
