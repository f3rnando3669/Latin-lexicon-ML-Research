For 
To apply <IDAA> to the statement "The museum's new gemstones and precious minerals exhibit needs more security guards. If you don't agree, then you must be planning to steal a piece of the exhibit," we will follow the structured steps for classifying the argument type:

**Step 1: Understanding the Candidate Statement**
- We carefully read and comprehend the statement in question: "The museum's new gemstones and precious minerals exhibit needs more security guards. If you don't agree, then you must be planning to steal a piece of the exhibit."

**Step 2: Identifying the Generalization Fallacy (<G>)**
- We check if the statement makes a broad claim based on specific instances. The statement does not make broad claims about a group based on limited instances but asserts a need for more security.

**Step 3: Identifying the False Enumeration Fallacy (<FE>)**
- We examine whether the statement presents a list of options that are too limited or unnecessarily extended. The statement presents a dichotomy: if you don’t agree with needing more guards, then you intend to steal. This indicates a false dichotomy, falsely limiting the options to only two.

**Step 4: Identifying the Inappropriate Reason Fallacy (<IR>)**
- We see if the statement offers a reason unconnected to or irrelevant for supporting the proposition. The reason given (planning to steal) if you disagree with more security guards does not logically support the need for more security guards purely on the basis that disagreement equates to dishonest intentions.

**Step 5: Identifying the Redundant Reason Fallacy (<RR>)**
- We determine if the statement repeats the proposition in different words instead of providing a new reason. This is not the case here, as the statement presents a specific, albeit logically flawed reason.

**Step 6: Identifying the Weak Causal Basis Fallacy (<WCB>)**
- Assess whether it provides a causative link that is logically weak or insufficient. The statement's claim about someone’s intentions (planning to steal) lacks a direct and logical causal link to supporting the need for more security guards.

**Step 7: Identifying the False Universals Fallacy (<FU>)**
- We look for statements close to consensus points but lack proof or being falsely universal. The statement does not assert universally agreed points without proof but presents a false dichotomy.

**Step 8: Identifying the Double-Edged Phrases Fallacy (<DEP>)**
- We check if the statement contains phrases open to dual interpretations potentially against the speaker. This statement is reasonably straightforward and does not have dual interpretations.

**Step 9: Classification**
- Based on the investigation, the statement falls under the category of False Enumeration (<FE>), where it presents two limited and extreme options: agreeing with the need for more guards, or you're planning theft, ignoring other reasonable explanations.

**Step 10: Review**
- We review the classification to confirm that the analysis aligns with the definitions and characteristics of logical fallacies. The statement fits <FE> as it limits the choice to only two extremes, neither covering all possibilities nor considering alternative views.

Thus, the classified defective argument type for the statement "The museum's new gemstones and precious minerals exhibit needs more security guards. If you don't agree, then you must be planning to steal a piece of the exhibit" is <FE> (False Enumeration).
