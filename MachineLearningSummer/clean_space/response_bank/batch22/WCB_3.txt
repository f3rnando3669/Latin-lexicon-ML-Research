For 
Let's apply the step-by-step methodology described under <IDAA> to classify the statement "I drank bottled water and now I am sick, so the water must have made me sick."

### Step-by-Step Classification:

**Step 1: Understand and Document Definitions**
- We are familiar with the definitions of the defective argument types:
  - <G> (Generalization)
  - <FE> (False Enumeration)
  - <IR> (Inappropriate Reason)
  - <RR> (Redundant Reason)
  - <WCB> (Weak Causal Basis)
  - <FU> (False Universals)
  - <DEP> (Double-Edged Phrases)

**Step 2: Parsing the String <s>**
- "I drank bottled water and now I am sick, so the water must have made me sick."
  - Breaking it down:
    - Premise: "I drank bottled water and now I am sick"
    - Conclusion: "the water must have made me sick"

**Step 3: Identify Key Features of the Argument**
- The argument presents a causal relationship:
  - Action: Drinking bottled water
  - Result: Getting sick
  - Inferred Causal Link: The sickness is caused by drinking the bottled water

**Step 4: Classify Based on Definitions**
- This appears to fit the attributes of <WCB> (Weak Causal Basis):
  - The causal link is weak as there could be various other reasons for getting sick besides drinking the bottled water. Other potential causes are not considered, and the provided basis for blaming the water is not compelling enough.

**Step 5: Double-Check the Classification**
- Review:
  - The argument indeed uses a weak causal attribution without sufficient evidence.
  - No other category fits as well because it focuses primarily on establishing a cause-effect relationship on insufficient grounds.

**Step 6: Report the Result**
- The classification is <WCB> (Weak Causal Basis).
  - Justification: The statement infers a direct cause-and-effect relationship between drinking bottled water and getting sick without substantial evidence, making the causal basis weak.

**Step 7: Handle Edge Cases**
- It clearly fits <WCB>; no edge case considerations are required here.

### Result:
The statement "I drank bottled water and now I am sick, so the water must have made me sick." is classified as <WCB> (Weak Causal Basis).

Thus, the logical fallacy used in the statement is Weak Causal Basis.
