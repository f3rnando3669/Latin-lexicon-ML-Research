For 
To classify the argument "My best friend says you’re a liar, so I’m not going to talk to you." using the application of task decomposition to the classification of a string as one of the defective argument types <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>, we will follow the step-by-step process outlined:

### Step 1: Understanding the Input
Identify the string <s> that needs to be classified.
- The string is: "My best friend says you’re a liar, so I’m not going to talk to you."

### Step 2: Parsing the Argument
Break down <s> into its logical components.
- Main Proposition: "I’m not going to talk to you."
- Supporting Reason: "My best friend says you’re a liar."

### Step 3: Identifying the Defective Argument Type
Assess each logical component of the argument to determine which specific characteristics of the defective argument types it exhibits. 

#### Sub-step 3.1: Check for Generalization (<G>)
- Does <s> claim a general truth based on a specific instance?
  - No, it does not make a broad generalization based on one instance.

#### Sub-step 3.2: Check for False Enumeration (<FE>)
- Does <s> list fewer or more options than actually exist?
  - No, it doesn't present a limited list of options.

#### Sub-step 3.3: Check for Inappropriate Reason (<IR>)
- Does <s> provide a reason that doesn’t logically support the proposition?
  - Yes, the reasoning provided ("My best friend says you’re a liar") does not logically support the conclusion ("I’m not going to talk to you"). This is an appeal to authority fallacy that does not substantiate why the speaker has chosen to cut off communication.

#### Sub-step 3.4: Check for Redundant Reason (<RR>)
- Does <s> present a reason that merely restates the proposition in different words?
  - No, it does not restate the proposition.

#### Sub-step 3.5: Check for Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>)
- Does <s> offer a causal basis that is not compelling enough to support the proposition?
  - Not really, it’s more about the relevance of the reason rather than its weakness.

#### Sub-step 3.6: Check for False Universals (<FU>)
- Does <s> assert universally agreed points without proof?
  - No, it doesn’t assert universally agreed points.

#### Sub-step 3.7: Check for Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>)
- Does <s> use statements open to dual interpretations?
  - No, it doesn’t use ambiguous language.

### Step 4: Classification
Based on the characteristics identified in step 3, the argument most clearly fits <IR> since the reasoning provided by the speaker ("My best friend says you’re a liar") does not logically support the proposition ("I’m not going to talk to you").

### Step 5: Validate the Classification
Recheck that this fits the definition of <IR>:
- <IR> is defined as providing a reason that doesn’t logically support the proposition. In this case, the reason relies on the hearsay of a third party and does not give a direct logical reason for ending communication.

Therefore, the string "My best friend says you’re a liar, so I’m not going to talk to you." is classified as <IR>.
