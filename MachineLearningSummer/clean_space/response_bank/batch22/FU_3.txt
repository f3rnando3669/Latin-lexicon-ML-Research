For 
Let's apply the decomposition of the advanced task <IDA> (classifying a string as one of the defective argument types) step by step as defined by <IDAA>.

#### Given String (s):
"Officer, I was only driving as fast as everyone around me. I'm sure I wasn't speeding."

### Step-by-Step Decomposition:

1. **Identify the Main Claim**:
   - Main Claim: "I'm sure I wasn't speeding."

2. **Analyze the Structure of the Claim**:
   - The supporting argument is: "I was only driving as fast as everyone around me."

3. **Match with Argument Types**:
   - The assertion here is that the speaker's driving speed should be considered acceptable because it matched that of other drivers. This attempts to validate the proposition by appealing to common practice or popularity, suggesting that because "everyone around me" was driving at that speed, it must not be speeding.

4. **Classify the Claim**:
   - This structure matches with <FU> (False Universals), as it relies on the assumption that because everyone else was doing something, it should be valid or acceptable without presenting direct evidence for why it wasn't speeding.

### Conclusion:
The claim "Officer, I was only driving as fast as everyone around me. I'm sure I wasn't speeding." is classified as <FU> (False Universals).
