For 
To apply \( IDAA \) to the string "I thought you were a good person, but you weren’t in class today," we'll follow the decomposed steps laid out.

### Step-by-Step Classification:

1. **Initial Reading and Comprehension**:
   - Read \( s \) carefully: "I thought you were a good person, but you weren’t in class today."
   - The main claim: "You are not a good person."

2. **Identify Argument Characteristics**:
   - Step 2a: Check for generalization: The argument does not seem to generalize from specific instances.
   - Step 2b: Check for false enumeration: The argument does not list options.
   - Step 2c: See if the reason provided does not logically support the proposition: The reason (absence from class) does not logically support the claim about being a good person.
     - **Identified Characteristics**: The reason given ("you weren’t in class today") does not logically support the proposition ("you are not a good person").

3. **Match Against Definitions**:
   - Compare with \( <IR> \) definition: Providing a reason that doesn't logically support the proposition.
     - **Match**: The claim fits the definition of \( <IR> \) since the attendance in class does not logically correlate with being a good person.

4. **Conclude Classification**:
   - Assign: The string \( s \) is classified as type \( <IR> \).
   - Document: "The argument 'I thought you were a good person, but you weren’t in class today' provides an inappropriate reason (absence from class) to support the claim about being a good person, fitting type \( <IR> \)."

Thus, the string "I thought you were a good person, but you weren’t in class today" is classified as \(\boxed{<IR>}\).
