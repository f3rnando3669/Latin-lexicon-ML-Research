For 
To apply \( <IDAA> \) to the string "It is immoral to kill an innocent human being.  Fetuses are innocent human beings.  Therefore, it is immoral to kill fetuses.", we will follow the outlined steps meticulously:

### Step 1: Identify and Understand the Criteria for Each Argument Type

- **Generalization (<G>):** Claims a general truth based on a specific instance.
- **False Enumeration (<FE>):** Lists fewer or more options than actually exist.
- **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>):** Provides a reason that doesn't logically support the proposition.
- **Redundant Reason (<RR>):** Gives a reason that says the same thing as the proposition in different words.
- **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>):** Offers a causal basis that is not compelling enough to support the proposition.
- **False Universals (<FU>):** Asserts universally agreed points without proof.
- **Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>):** Uses statements open to dual interpretations.

### Step 2: Parse and Interpret the String \( <s> \)

The given string is structured as follows:
1. Premise: "It is immoral to kill an innocent human being."
2. Premise: "Fetuses are innocent human beings."
3. Conclusion: "Therefore, it is immoral to kill fetuses."

### Step 3: Compare with Argument Type Criteria

We will now compare these components against each defined argument type:

1. **Generalization (<G>):** 
   - The string does not claim a general truth based on a specific instance. It uses a general moral statement followed by a classification and a logical conclusion.
   - **Not <G>.**

2. **False Enumeration (<FE>):** 
   - The argument does not present a list of options or a false dichotomy.
   - **Not <FE>.**

3. **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>):** 
   - The reasons provided logically support the conclusion according to the moral framework given.
   - **Not <IR>.**

4. **Redundant Reason (<RR>):** 
   - The conclusion is derived fairly directly from the premises without merely restating the premise in different words.
   - **Not <RR>.**

5. **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>):** 
   - The argument is about a moral proposition, not a causal relation with a compelling/non-compelling explanation.
   - **Not <WCB>.**

6. **False Universals (<FU>):** 
   - It does not assert universally agreed points without proof, rather it presents a particular moral argument.
   - **Not <FU>.**

7. **Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>):** 
   - The statements do not seem open to dual interpretations against the speaker.
   - **Not <DEP>.**

### Step 4: Decision and Classification

From the analysis above, the string "It is immoral to kill an innocent human being.  Fetuses are innocent human beings.  Therefore, it is immoral to kill fetuses." does not neatly fit into any of the defective argument types \( <G> \), \( <FE> \), \( <IR> \), \( <RR> \), \( <WCB> \), \( <FU> \), or \( <DEP> \) provided.

There seems to be no indication that the string in question constitutes a "defective argument" based on the criteria given. Hence, the string does not fall into any of the specified categories for defective arguments. It is a structured syllogistic argument and should be evaluated on its logical and moral merits rather than classified under the defective argument types defined.
