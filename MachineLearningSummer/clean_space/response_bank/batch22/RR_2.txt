For 
Let's apply the IDAA (application of decomposition D to the task IDA) to the given string:

**Given String <s>**:  
"We need to fix our broken judicial system by electing new people."

### Step-by-Step Application

1. **Understand the Definitions**:  
   Review the definitions of each defective argument type:
   - Generalization (<G>)
   - False Enumeration (<FE>)
   - Inappropriate Reason (<IR>)
   - Redundant Reason (<RR>)
   - Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>)
   - False Universals (<FU>)
   - Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>)

2. **Identify Keywords and Phrases**:  
   - "fix our broken judicial system"
   - "by electing new people"

3. **Apply Logical Analysis**:
   - **Generalization (<G>)**: The statement is not making a general claim based on a specific instance.
   - **False Enumeration (<FE>)**: The statement does not seem to be listing options or limiting choices.
   - **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>)**: The statement offers "electing new people" as a solution to "fixing our broken judicial system." To identify if this is inappropriate, we need to check if electing new people logically supports fixing the judicial system.
   - **Redundant Reason (<RR>)**: The statement is providing a reason but itâ€™s not merely restating the proposition with different wording.
   - **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The reason provided ("electing new people") may not directly address or solve the complex issues in the judicial system, suggesting a weak causal relationship.
   - **False Universals (<FU>)**: The statement is not making universally agreed points without proof.
   - **Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>)**: The statement is not using any phrases that can be interpreted in a dual, potentially detrimental way.

4. **Compare with Definitions**:
   - Upon closer inspection, "electing new people" as a means to "fix our broken judicial system" might be an insufficient or weak causal basis. Just electing new people doesn't ensure that the judicial system will be fixed as it doesn't provide a strong, compelling reason how electing new individuals would directly address the systemic issues in the judiciary.

5. **Classify**:
   - The string <s> "We need to fix our broken judicial system by electing new people." is best classified as type <WCB> (Weak Causal Basis).

### Conclusion
The provided string "We need to fix our broken judicial system by electing new people." is classified as type <WCB> (Weak Causal Basis).

This classification is due to the weak relationship between the proposed solution (electing new people) and the complex problem (fixing the broken judicial system), which does not logically guarantee a resolution to the problem presented.
