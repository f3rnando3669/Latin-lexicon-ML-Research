For 
Sure, let's apply the decomposition method <D> to classify the string "That restaurant is popular because everyone in town goes there." step by step.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition of <IDA>:

**Step 1: Understand the Types of Defective Arguments**
- Generalization (<G>)
- False Enumeration (<FE>)
- Inappropriate Reason (<IR>)
- Redundant Reason (<RR>)
- Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>)
- False Universals (<FU>)
- Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>)

**Step 2: Identify Key Characteristics for Each Type**
- **Generalization (<G>):** Claims a general truth based on a specific instance.
- **False Enumeration (<FE>):** Lists fewer or more options than actually exist.
- **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>):** Provides a reason that doesn't logically support the proposition.
- **Redundant Reason (<RR>):** Appears to be a new reason but says the same thing as the proposition using different words.
- **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>):** Offers a causal basis that is not compelling enough to support the proposition.
- **False Universals (<FU>):** Asserts universally agreed points without proof.
- **Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>):** Uses statements open to dual interpretations, potentially against the speaker.

**Step 3: Analyze the Given String <s>**
- Break down the structure of the argument presented in the string:
  - Proposition: "That restaurant is popular."
  - Supporting Reason: "Because everyone in town goes there."

**Step 4: Match the Characteristics to the String <s>**
- **For <G>:** The string is not claiming a general truth based on a specific instance.
- **For <FE>:** The string is not listing limited or exhaustive options.
- **For <IR>:** The relationship between the proposition and the reason seems to rely on popularity as a logical reason for popularity, suggesting circular reasoning.
- **For <RR>:** The supporting reason "because everyone in town goes there" is essentially saying "it's popular because it's popular," which is just restating the proposition in different words.
- **For <WCB>:** The claim does not involve a weak causal basis about events.
- **For <FU>:** The argument does suggest that since everyone in town goes there, it is popular, assuming unanimity.
- **For <DEP>:** The statement is not open to dual interpretations.

**Step 5: Classify the String <s>**
- The closest match seems to be **Redundant Reason (<RR>)** because it states that a place is popular because everyone goes there, essentially restating the concept of being popular in different words.

### Conclusion:
The string "That restaurant is popular because everyone in town goes there." is classified as **Redundant Reason (<RR>)**.
