For 
To classify the given string \( s \) as one of the defective argument types using the \( IDAA \) method, we will methodically follow each step defined earlier. Here’s the string for reference:

"Perhaps the most classic example of this fallacy is the argument for the existence of God. Due to the understanding of nature through science, many of the arguments that used to be used for God (or gods) were abandoned, only to be replaced with new ones, usually involving questions to which science has not definitively answered yet. The move from creationism to intelligent design is a prime example. Currently the origin of life is a popular argument for God (although a classic argument from ignorance), and an area where we very well may have a scientific answer in the next decade, at which time, the 'origin of life' argument will fade away and be replaced by another, thus moving the figurative goalposts farther back as our understanding of the natural world increases.
Exception: This fallacy should not be confused with an argument or set of arguments, with multiple propositions inherent in the argument. The reason for the difference between this kind of argument and the moving the goalposts fallacy, is a subtle one, but indicated by a strong initial claim ('has to be', 'must', 'required for', etc.) that gets answered and/or what appears to be ad hoc objections that follow eventually leading to an impossible request for proof.
Fun Fact: The name “moving the goalposts” comes from the analogy of kicking a perfect field goal in American football, only to have the goalposts be moved on you. This would be very unfair.

### Steps for \( IDAA \):

1. **Identify Key Features in \( s \):**
   - \( s \) addresses logical fallacies specifically related to arguments for the existence of God, and the shifting nature of these arguments (i.e., "moving the goalposts").
   - Mentions "moving the goalposts" explicitly, indicating a fallacy where the goal or criteria for evidence is continuously shifted to avoid refutation.

2. **Check Examples Similarity:**
   - This string does not directly align with examples of <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>.
   - It rather explains the concept of moving goalposts, which could be confused with a type of fallacious reasoning but is more of a description than an argument itself.

3. **Contextual Analysis:**
   - The context is educational, attempting to clarify why certain arguments are fallacious by using the example of moving goalposts.
   - Not directly presenting an argument but analyzing and explaining a type of fallacy.

4. **Rule Matching:**
   - Let's apply each rule to see if the string \( s \) fits:
     - **<G>:** No generalization from a specific instance.
     - **<FE>:** No limited enumeration of options.
     - **<IR>:** Not providing irrelevant reasons.
     - **<RR>:** Not repeating the proposition in different words.
     - **<WCB>:** Not offering a weak causal link.
     - **<FU>:** Not asserting universally agreed points without proof.
     - **<DEP>:** No dual interpretations.
   - It does not seem to fit neatly into any of the defective argument types.

5. **Classify \( s \):**
   - Upon reviewing the classification rules, it appears that \( s \) does not present an argument that falls into one of the defective types. Rather, it explains what might be considered a logical fallacy (moving the goalposts) but does not argue using such a fallacy.

**Classification:** The string \( s \) is an explanation of a logical fallacy, "moving the goalposts," rather than an argument demonstrating a defective argument type. Therefore, it does not neatly fit into any of the given categories (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>).

The task \( IDAA \) clarified that while \( s \) discussed logical fallacies, it did not commit one of the defective argument types defined in this context.
