For 
To classify the argument presented in the dialogue using the defined defective argument types, we'll follow the step-by-step breakdown for IDAA:

### Step-by-Step Breakdown for IDAA

1. **Understand the Definitions:**
   - <G>: Generalization
   - <FE>: False Enumeration
   - <IR>: Inappropriate Reason
   - <RR>: Redundant Reason
   - <WCB>: Weak Causal Basis
   - <FU>: False Universals
   - <DEP>: Double-Edged Phrases

2. **Identify Key Components in the String:**
   - Speaker 1 claims Jesus was not crucified because the Quran says so.
   - Speaker 2 queries the truthfulness of the Quran.
   - Speaker 1 argues the Quran is true because it is the Word of God.
   - Speaker 2 queries the truthfulness of that claim.
   - Speaker 1 asserts it is true because God tells so in the Quran.

3. **Match to Definitions:**
   - This argument involves a circular reasoning process where the claim and the justification rely on each other.

4. **Determine the Logical Structure of the Argument:**
   - The argument provided does not introduce new, independent evidence to support the main proposition. Instead, it circles back to the original claim by using the proposition itself as proof (“The Quran is true because it says it’s the Word of God and everything it says is true.”).

5. **Classify the String:**
   - This structure exhibits characteristics of <RR> (Redundant Reason) because the reasoning circles back to the proposition using essentially the same assertion in different words (circular reasoning). It is not establishing independent or new grounds but reiterating the same point in an attempt to prove itself.

6. **Verify the Classification:**
   - Re-examine the definition of <RR>:
     - “Redundant Reason when it appears to be presented as a new reason but says the same thing as the proposition using different words.”
   - Ensure the dialogue aligns with this type, which it does because the reasoning provided by Speaker 1 is circular and redundant.

**Final Classification:**
The string is an example of <RR> (Redundant Reason).
