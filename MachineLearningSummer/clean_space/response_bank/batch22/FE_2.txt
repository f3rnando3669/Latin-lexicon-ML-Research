For 
Certainly! Let's apply <IDAA> to the given string step by step.

### Example String <s>:
"You either support Hillary Clinton for President or you don't believe in women's rights."

### Step-by-Step Decomposition of <IDA> to <D>:

#### Step 1: Understanding Definitions
- Internalize the definitions of each defective argument type: <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, and <DEP>.

#### Step 2: Initial Reading and Identification
- Carefully read the string: "You either support Hillary Clinton for President or you don't believe in women's rights."
- Note any key phrases or structures that hint at a specific defective argument type.

#### Step 3: Analyzing Specific Instances
- The argument does not seem to derive a general truth from a specific instance, so <G> is unlikely.

#### Step 4: Redundancy Check
- The argument does not present a reason that simply restates the argument, so <RR> is unlikely.

#### Step 5: Weak Causal Relationships
- The argument does not offer a causal basis, so <WCB> is unlikely.

#### Step 6: Universal Claims
- The argument does not assert a universally agreed point without proof, so <FU> is unlikely.

#### Step 7: Dual Interpretations
- The statement does not appear to use dual interpretations, so <DEP> is unlikely.

#### Step 8: Final Classification
- The argument presents only two choices: Either support Hillary Clinton or don't believe in women's rights, ignoring other possible positions. This suggests an enumeration fallacy.

Based on this analysis, the string "You either support Hillary Clinton for President or you don't believe in women's rights." is classified as <FE> (False Enumeration).

The task is now complete with a step-by-step application of <IDAA>, leading to a classification of the given string.
