Sure, let's apply the IDAA (application of D to IDA) to the string "Get Verizon--1 billion people can't be wrong."

### Step 1: Identify the Core Proposition or Claim
The core proposition here is: "Get Verizon."

### Step 2: Analyze the Structure of the Argument
The argument suggests that because many people subscribe to Verizon ("1 billion people"), it must be the correct choice for everyone.

### Step 3: Identify Keywords and Phrasing
- The phrase "1 billion people can't be wrong" suggests a universal agreement or popularity as the reason for action.
- "Get Verizon" is the action recommended based on this universal appeal.

### Step 4: Map to Defined Defective Argument Types
- This falls under the category of False Universals (FU). The argument implies that because a large number of people use Verizon, it must be the right decision without providing actual evidence or reasoning for why Verizon is a better choice other than its popularity.

### Step 5: Classify the String
- The classification for the string "Get Verizon--1 billion people can't be wrong" would be <FU>.

### Recap:
By following this step-by-step approach, we analyzed the core proposition, identified the structure and key phrasing of the argument, and mapped it to the most appropriate type of defective argument, concluding that it is a case of False Universals (FU).
