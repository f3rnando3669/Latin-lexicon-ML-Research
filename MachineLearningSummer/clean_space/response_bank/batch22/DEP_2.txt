For 
Let's apply the decomposition process <IDAA> to the given string. Below are the steps, as previously defined.

### Example String <s>: 
"Speaker 1: We are using thousands of people, who are going door to door to help us spread the word about social injustice and the need for change. 
Speaker 2: Well then, I can’t be a part of this because I was always been taught that it’s wrong to use people."

### Step-by-Step <IDAA>:

1. **Step 1: Identify the Core Proposition**:

   **Speaker 2's Proposition**: "I can't be a part of this."

2. **Step 2: Analyze the Supporting Reason or Evidence**:

   **Reasoning/Evidence**: "Because I was always been taught that it’s wrong to use people."

3. **Step 3: Compare with Definitions**:

   - **<G>: Generalization**: Claiming a general truth based on a specific instance.
   - **<FE>: False Enumeration**: Listing fewer or more options than actually exist.
   - **<IR>: Inappropriate Reason**: Providing a reason that doesn't logically support the proposition.
   - **<RR>: Redundant Reason**: Reason presented as new but says the same thing.
   - **<WCB>: Weak Causal Basis**: Offering a causal basis that isn't compelling enough.
   - **<FU>: False Universals**: Asserting universally agreed points without proof.
   - **<DEP>: Double-Edged Phrases**: Using statements open to dual interpretations.

   Comparing the reasoning against these definitions:
   - Speaker 2's reason "it’s wrong to use people" applies a universal moral standpoint to a context where "using people" might mean employing volunteers for a cause. 

4. **Step 4: Classify the Defective Argument Type**:

   - This fits the definition of **<DEP>: Double-Edged Phrases** since the statement is open to dual interpretations. "Using people" can mean exploitation in a negative sense or employing volunteers in a positive activity.

Thus, the classification of the example string <s> is:

### Classification: <DEP>

By following each step systematically, we can accurately classify the defective argument type present in the given string.
