### Applying the Decomposed Steps to the Example String

**Example String**: "Paranormal activity is real because I have experienced what can only be described as paranormal activity."

#### Step 1: Identify the Argument or Claim
The core argument in the string is: "Paranormal activity is real."

#### Step 2: Analyze the Structure of the Argument
- **Assertion**: Paranormal activity is real.
- **Support**: The reason provided is the speaker's personal experience, which they describe as paranormal.

#### Step 3: Compare with Known Defective Argument Types
- **Generalization (<G>)**: This does not generalize a broader truth from a specific instance explicitly, although it uses a single instance as proof.
- **False Enumeration (<FE>)**: This does not list options.
- **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>)**: The reason offered (personal experience) doesnâ€™t logically support the broader claim that paranormal activity is real for everyone.
- **Redundant Reason (<RR>)**: The support is essentially the same as the proposition, restated in a different way.
- **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The argument does not involve a weak causal relationship.
- **False Universals (<FU>)**: The argument does not assert universally agreed points without proof.
- **Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>)**: The statement is not open to dual interpretations.

#### Step 4: Classify the Argument Type
The argument essentially restates its support as the proposition using different words. "Paranormal activity is real" is supported by "I have experienced what can only be described as paranormal activity," which is essentially saying the same thing as the assertion.

**Classification**: **<RR> (Redundant Reason)**
