For 
To perform a classification of the given argument using the defined defective argument types (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>), we will apply the following steps of <D> to perform <IDAA>:

### Decomposition of the Task (<D>)
1. **Identify Proposition (<P>):** Find the main assertion or claim in the argument.
2. **Identify Reason (<R>):** Determine the causal basis or reasoning provided to support the proposition.
3. **Classify Reason (<R>):** Determine if the reasoning provided falls into one of the defective argument types (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>).

### Application of Decomposition to the Argument (<IDAA>)

**Step 1: Identify Proposition (<P>)**
- **Proposition (<P>):** "Every American is wealthy."

**Step 2: Identify Reason (<R>)**
- **Reason (<R>):** "The United States is the wealthiest nation in the world."

**Step 3: Classify Reason (<R>)**
- Examine if the reason provided (<R>) adequately supports the proposition (<P>), or if it falls into a defective argument type:
  - The reason given states a fact about the wealth status of the United States as a whole.
  - However, it generalizes this wealth status to every individual American without considering individual variability.

**Conclusion of Classification:**
- The argument makes a broad and unsupported leap from a general characteristic of a country to every individual in that country.
- This pattern fits into the defective argument type known as Generalization (<G>), where an assertion about a part is incorrectly extended to the whole.

**Classification:**
- The argument "The United States is the wealthiest nation in the world. So every American is wealthy." is of type <G> (Generalization).

This completes the step-by-step application of <IDAA> to classify the given argument as type <G>.
