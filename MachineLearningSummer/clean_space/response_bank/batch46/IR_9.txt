For 
Given the task of classifying the given string "Studies show that it takes up to seven years for the human body to digest a piece of gum." as one of the defective argument types <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>, I will apply the decomposition process <D> to this identification task <IDA>. Here are the specific steps involved in the process:

1. **Identify the Proposition <P>:**
   - In the given statement, the proposition <P> is "it takes up to seven years for the human body to digest a piece of gum."

2. **Identify the Reason <R>:**
   - The reason <R> is presented as "Studies show that," suggesting scientific backing or research to support the proposition.

3. **Evaluate and Classify the Type of Defective Argument:**
   - **Generalization (G):** The statement doesn't generalize a specific instance to all individuals.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** The statement doesn’t present itself as a choice or a limited set of possibilities.
   - **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** The support for the proposition "Studies show that" appears weak because it doesn’t provide detailed or conclusive evidence.
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** The reason is not simply a rephrasing of the proposition.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** This seems to resonate, as the reason provided "Studies show that" doesn't elaborate on how the studies prove the proposition or doesn't provide a compelling causal basis.
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** The statement doesn’t appeal to universal agreement or popularity.
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** The language in the statement doesn’t appear to have ambiguous meanings.

Based upon our evaluation, the primary candidate for the classification is <WCB> — Insufficient Causal Basis.

In conclusion, applying the decomposition of <t> into specific steps to the classification task, <IDAA>, the string "Studies show that it takes up to seven years for the human body to digest a piece of gum." is categorized under Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>).
