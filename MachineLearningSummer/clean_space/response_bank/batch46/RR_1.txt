For 
To apply the task <IDAA> (applying the decomposition method to classify the argument defect) to the given statement, we will decompose <IDA> into identifiable and manageable steps. Here is a step-by-step decomposition:

### Step 1: Analyze the Structure of the Argument
1. Identify the Proposition (<P>).
2. Identify the Reason (<R>).

### Step 2: Evaluate the Reason
1. Determine if the Reason actually supports the Proposition.
2. Check if there are any logical fallacies or defective argument characteristics.

### Step 3: Classification of Statement
1. Compare the identified issues with the provided definitions of defective argument types: <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <WCB>, <RR>, <FU>, and <DEP>.
2. Classify the argument into one of the types, if applicable.

### Now, letâ€™s apply <IDAA> to the statement:
"The Bible is the Word of God because God tells us it is... in the Bible.

X is true because of Y.
Y is true because of X."

### Step 1: Analyze the Structure of the Argument
1. **Proposition (<P>):** "The Bible is the Word of God."
2. **Reason (<R>):** "because God tells us it is... in the Bible."

### Step 2: Evaluate the Reason
1. **Evaluate Reason's Support:** The Reason refers back to the very document (the Bible) it is trying to validate.
2. **Identify Logical Fallacy:**
   - The Reason does not provide independent support for the Proposition.
   - It uses the Proposition itself to justify its validity, creating a circular reasoning.

### Step 3: Classification of Statement
1. **Compare with Definitions:**
   - **<RR> Faulty Repetition of Proposition:** This seems most applicable because the Reason restates the Proposition in a circular manner. The argument claims that the Bible is authoritative because it says it is, which is simply restating the Proposition without providing an independent Reason.
   - Other types like <FU> Presumptuous Consensus or <IR> Inconclusive Reason do not directly address the circular nature of the argument here.

    Therefore, the correct classification is:
    **<RR> Faulty Repetition of Proposition.**

So, the provided statement "The Bible is the Word of God because God tells us it is... in the Bible." exhibits the defective argument type <RR> Faulty Repetition of Proposition.
