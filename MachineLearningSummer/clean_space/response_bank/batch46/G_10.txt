For 
Let's apply the process of decomposing and classifying the given argument "Four out of five dentists recommend Happy Glossy Smiley toothpaste brand. Therefore, it must be great." into specific steps to determine which defective argument type it belongs to.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition and Classification (IDAA)

1. **Identify the Proposition (P):**
   - The proposition (what we intend to prove) here is "Happy Glossy Smiley toothpaste brand must be great."

2. **Identify the Reason (R):**
   - The reason provided is "Four out of five dentists recommend Happy Glossy Smiley toothpaste brand."

3. **Evaluate if the Reason (R) is applicable and conclusive:**
   - Check whether the recommendation of dentists conclusively demonstrates that the toothpaste is great. In this case, the recommendation of a subset of dentists does not necessarily prove that the toothpaste brand is great beyond reasonable doubt.

4. **Evaluate the type of defect in the argument using the definitions provided:**

   - **Generalization (G):**
     - This involves incorrectly applying the properties of a part to the whole.
     - Evaluation: "Four out of five dentists recommend" suggests a subset's preference, not an unequivocal generalization applicable to all dentists or consumers. 

   - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):**
     - This involves presenting limited possibilities as exhaustive.
     - Evaluation: The argument doesn't specifically enumerate possibilities beyond the dentists' recommendations, so it doesn't rely on an exhaustive list of reasons.

   - **Inconclusive Reason (IR):**
     - This is when the reason does not conclusively demonstrate the propositionâ€™s correctness.
     - Evaluation: "Four out of five dentists recommend" does not necessarily prove the proposition that the toothpaste is "great." This falls under IR, as it draws a conclusion based on a potentially non-conclusive reason.

   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):**
     - This is when the reason provided (R) lacks sufficient causal basis.
     - Evaluation: Here, denotes recommendations rather than evidence of product efficacy, making this a weaker case of WCB. 

   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):**
     - This involves repeating the proposition in the reason.
     - Evaluation: The argument does not repeat the proposition but provides a reason based on a subset group's recommendation.

   - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):**
     - This involves assuming something to be true because it is widely agreed upon.
     - Evaluation: The argument does imply a form of consensus among a subset (dentists), making it lean towards FU.

   - **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):**
     - This involves words that can be taken in another sense than intended.
     - Evaluation: The language used in the argument is clear and unambiguous within the given context.

5. **Key Conclusion:**
   - Evaluate which defective argument type best fits: Based on the step-by-step evaluation, the argument is primarily marked by an **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**.

### Final Classification
The defective argument type of the given statement "Four out of five dentists recommend Happy Glossy Smiley toothpaste brand. Therefore, it must be great." is <IR>, due to the reason provided not conclusively establishing the truth of the proposition.

By systematically breaking down the argument and analyzing it against the definitions, we have classified it as an **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**.
