Certainly! To classify the defective argument in the given string "President Jones raised taxes, and then the rate of violent crime went up. Jones is responsible for the rise in crime." step by step, we proceed with the advanced task decomposition (D) for IDA (classifying the string).

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (D):
1. **Identify the Proposition (P):** Determine the main claim or assertion in the argument.
2. **Identify the Reason (R):** Determine the causal basis or reason provided for the proposition.
3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (PR):** Look for any corroborating evidence or additional arguments that support the reason.
4. **Analyze for Defective Argument Types:**
    - **Generalization (G)**
    - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**
    - **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**
    - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**
    - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**
    - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**
    - **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**
5. **Classify the Defective Argument:** Based on the analysis, classify the argument according to the appropriate defective argument type.

### Applying IDAA:

1. **Identify the Proposition (P):**
   - Proposition: "Jones is responsible for the rise in crime."

2. **Identify the Reason (R):**
   - Reason: "President Jones raised taxes, and then the rate of violent crime went up."

3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (PR):**
   - There is no additional corroborating evidence provided in the argument; it is based solely on the temporal sequence of events.

4. **Analyze for Defective Argument Types:**
    - **Generalization (G):** The argument does not claim that all instances everywhere follow this pattern.
    - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** This does not involve a limited set of possibilities.
    - **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** The reason is based on temporal correlation without direct causative evidence, which fits here, but let’s keep analyzing.
    - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** The reason implies causation based merely on correlation (taxes raised → crime rate went up).
    - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR):** The reason is not a mere restatement of the proposition.
    - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** The argument does not claim that everyone agrees on this, implicitly or explicitly.
    - **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** There is no ambiguous language present; the terms used are clear in their intended meaning.

5. **Classify the Defective Argument:**

   The argument "President Jones raised taxes, and then the rate of violent crime went up. Jones is responsible for the rise in crime." commits the fallacy of **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**. The causal link between raising taxes and the increase in violent crime is weak and unsubstantiated; correlation does not imply causation.

Therefore, the classification of the given argument is <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis).
