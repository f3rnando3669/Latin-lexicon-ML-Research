For 
Let's apply the steps of <IDAA> to classify the given argument "Men score better on math than women do. Jerry is a man. Therefore, Jerry is better at math than Sylvia, who is a woman."

1. **Identify the Proposition <P>:**
   - Determine what the argument intends to prove. In this case, the proposition is "Jerry is better at math than Sylvia."

2. **Identify the Reason <R>:**
   - Find the causal basis for P. Here, the reason given is "Men score better on math than women do."

3. **Proof of Reason <PR>:**
   - Check if there is additional proof or evidence presented to support R. In this argument, no additional proof is provided to reinforce the reason.

4. **Analyze for Defective Argument Types:**
   - Determine if the argument falls into one of the classifications of defective arguments (G, FE, IR, RR, WCB, FU, DEP).

Let's break down each defective argument type to see which one fits:

- **<G> Generalization:** 
  - This argument might generalize from a supposed statistical fact ("Men score better on math than women do.") to an individual case (Jerry and Sylvia). However, we need to assess if the generalization leads directly to an assertion about all individuals.

- **<FE> Incomplete Enumeration:** 
  - This type involves missing out on possibilities but isn’t applicable here since there aren’t alternative possibilities to consider directly.

- **<IR> Inconclusive Reason:** 
  - This would apply if the reason given doesn’t conclusively support the proposition. The reason here is a general statistical claim used to argue about individual performance, which is inconclusive without more specific evidence.

- **<RR> Faulty Repetition of Proposition:**
  - This argument doesn’t suffer from repeating the proposition as the reason.

- **<WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis:**
  - Here, R might not be compelling enough to establish P. This is a potential match since statistical averages don’t necessarily apply to individual cases.

- **<FU> Presumptuous Consensus:**
  - This argument does not assume a consensus that remains in dispute.

- **<DEP> Ambiguous Language Use:**
  - The language used is clear and doesn’t suffer from ambiguity based on the context provided.

Thus, two potentially applicable defective argument types emerge:
- **<G> Generalization**
- **<IR> Inconclusive Reason**
- **<WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis**

Among these:
- **<G> Generalization** fits the classification best, as the argument generalizes from the statistical data about groups to assert something about individuals without considering individual variation.

Therefore, the final classification of this argument by applying <IDAA> is:

**IDAA Result: The argument represents a Generalization (<G>).**
