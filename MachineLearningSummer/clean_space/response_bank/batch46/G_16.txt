For 
Certainly! Let's apply \( \text{IDAA} \) to the string "My first day of basketball practice was easy, so it will always be easy."

### Step-by-Step Decomposition:

1. **Identify and Understand the Proposition (\(P\)):**
   - Proposition (\(P\)): "My first day of basketball practice was easy."
   - Conclusion: "it will always be easy."

2. **Analyze the Reason (\(R\)):**
   - The argument implies that because the first instance (first day) was easy, all future instances (subsequent days of basketball practice) will also be easy.

3. **Evaluate the Type of Defective Argument:**
   - **Generalization (\(G\)):** An assertion based on one part or majority, but not representative of all.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (\(FE\)):** Claims to have considered all possibilities but misses pertinent ones.
   - **Inconclusive Reason (\(IR\)):** The reason does not conclusively establish the proposition.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (\(WCB\)):** Weak causal basis for the proposition.
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (\(RR\)):** Repeats the proposition as the reason.
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (\(FU\)):** Assumes the proposition is true based on disputed consensus.
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (\(DEP\)):** Proposition can be interpreted differently than intended.

4. **Classification Details:**
   - The proposition implies a generalization from a single instance (first day) to an entire set (all days).
   - The reasoning does not conclusively demonstrate that future days will follow the same pattern since it's based on limited evidence (one day's practice).
   - The conclusion is based on insufficient data to support the claim that "it will always be easy."

### Application of \( \text{IDAA} \):

After breaking down the steps and analyzing the argument, we classify the argument type as follows:

- **Generalization (\(G\))**: The string "My first day of basketball practice was easy, so it will always be easy" generalizes the ease of the first day to all future days of practice, which is a classic case of a Generalization fallacy.

### Conclusion:

Applying \( \text{IDAA} \) to "My first day of basketball practice was easy, so it will always be easy" results in the classification of the argument as a \( G \) (Generalization).
