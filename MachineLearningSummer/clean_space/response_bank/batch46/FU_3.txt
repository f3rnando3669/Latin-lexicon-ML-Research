For 
To apply \( IDAA \) to classify the string "Trump cites (biased) poll results showing that people think he’s a strong leader to prove a point that he is a strong leader. ABC News/Washington Post Poll (wrong big on election) said almost all stand by their vote on me & 53% said strong leader.", we need to decompose the task into specific steps and analyze the argument for its defective nature.

### Decomposition Steps (\( D \)) for Classifying Defective Arguments (\( IDA \)):

1. **Identify the Proposition (\( P \))**: Determine what is being asserted as true or what point is being made.
2. **Identify the Reason (\( R \))**: Examine the basis or justification provided for the proposition.
3. **Evaluate the Proof of Reason (\( PR \))**: Look at any additional arguments or evidence presented to support the reason.
4. **Compare with Defective Argument Types**: Determine if the proposition, reason, or proof of reason falls into any of the defective argument categories (\( G \), \( FE \), \( IR \), \( WCB \), \( RR \), \( FU \), \( DEP \)).

### Step-by-Step Application (\( IDAA \)):

**Step 1: Identify the Proposition (\( P \))**

- The proposition \( P \) is that Trump is a strong leader.

**Step 2: Identify the Reason (\( R \))**

- The reason \( R \) given is that a poll shows that people think he is a strong leader.

**Step 3: Evaluate the Proof of Reason (\( PR \))**

- The proof of reason \( PR \) involves citing the specific poll results: "ABC News/Washington Post Poll (wrong big on election) said almost all stand by their vote on me & 53% said strong leader."

**Step 4: Compare with Defective Argument Types**

- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (\( RR \))**: This would occur if the reason merely repeats the proposition without providing additional logic or evidence. In this case, the reason is not just a restatement but refers to an external poll.
  
- **Presumptuous Consensus (\( FU \))**: This involves assuming a proposition is true because a consensus (possibly biased or invalid) supports it. This argument relies on a poll (which is a kind of consensus), implying that because 53% of the respondents in a possibly biased poll believe Trump is a strong leader, he must be a strong leader.
  
- **Ambiguous Language Use (\( DEP \))**: This would involve ambiguous terms open to interpretation in another sense than intended. While the citation mentions a poll, it doesn't seem to involve ambiguous language but rather relies on statistical approval as a proof of leadership quality.
  
Considering these points, the argument fits most closely with:

### Conclusion
The argument "Trump cites (biased) poll results showing that people think he’s a strong leader to prove a point that he is a strong leader. ABC News/Washington Post Poll (wrong big on election) said almost all stand by their vote on me & 53% said strong leader." fits best under defective argument type **Presumptuous Consensus (\( FU \))**.

This is because it assumes the validity of the proposition based on a poll which is presented as a consensus, despite the fact that the method or the poll results themselves may be biased or disputed.
