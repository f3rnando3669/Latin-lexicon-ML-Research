For 
Let's apply the process of <IDAA> (the application of the decomposition of the advanced task <IDA> into specific steps) to the given string:

### Step 1: Understand and Identify the Proposition (<P>) and Reason (<R>):

- **Proposition (<P>)**: "the changes in the vacation policy must be good."
- **Reason (<R>)**: "Everyone seems to support the changes in the vacation policy, and if everyone likes them"

### Step 2: Analyze the Argument Structure:

Identify if any given defective argument types apply to this argument:
1. **Generalization (<G>)**: Assertion based on one part or majority, but applied to all? 
   - Not quite.
   
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: Are there unseen possibilities? 
   - No, this argument doesn't enumerate possibilities.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: Does the reason conclusively demonstrate the proposition? 
   - Not directly, but potentially worth noting.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: Is the causal basis weak? 
   - Not specifically causal here.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: Is the reason the same as the proposition? 
   - No, they are distinct statements.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: Is the proof assumed as certain because it's universally agreed upon?
   - Yes. The argument assumes that because "everyone" supports the changes, the changes must be good.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**: Is the language used ambiguously? 
   - No, the language is clear.

### Step 3: Classification:

Since the reason that "everyone supports the changes" is used to validate the proposition without any actual evidence beyond the assumed consensus, this aligns with:

- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**.

### Step 4: Conclusion:

After following the steps to identify and classify the defective argument type:

The given string **"Everyone seems to support the changes in the vacation policy, and if everyone likes them, they must be good."** represents a defective argument type **<FU>**.

### Summary:

**Type**: **<FU> (Presumptuous Consensus)**

Reasoning: The argument attempts to validate the proposition by appealing to the popularity of the opinion without providing substantive evidence.
