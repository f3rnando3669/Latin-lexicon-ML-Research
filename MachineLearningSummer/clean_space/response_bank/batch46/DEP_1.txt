For 
To apply <IDAA> to the statement "I didn’t steal your pen—I borrowed it," we will decompose the task into specific steps to determine the type of defective argument it represents from the given categories (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>).

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify the Propositions:**
   - Proposition 1: "I didn’t steal your pen."
   - Proposition 2: "I borrowed it."

2. **Clarify the Reasoning:**
   - The reasoning here seems to hinge on the distinction between "stealing" and "borrowing."

3. **Check Types of Defective Arguments:**
   - <G>: Generalization is not applicable here because the argument does not make a broad generalization.
   - <FE>: Incomplete Enumeration is not applicable because the argument does not involve enumerating possibilities.
   - <IR>: Inconclusive Reason is not applicable because the argument is not rejecting a proposition based on the characteristic of a person.
   - <RR>: Faulty Repetition of Proposition does not fit because the two propositions are not identical rephrasing but involve a distinction between terms.
   - <WCB>: Insufficient Causal Basis does not fit because there is no causal relationship being weakly established here.
   - <FU>: Presumptuous Consensus is not applicable because the argument does not rely on universal agreement or popularity as validation.

4. **Check for Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):**
   - The statement "I didn’t steal your pen—I borrowed it" hinges on the ambiguity between "stealing" and "borrowing." This means the speaker claims to have borrowed the pen, implying that they intend to return it. However, to someone else, taking without permission (even if intending to return) might still be perceived as theft or inappropriate. The ambiguity in the terms "steal" and "borrow" allows the speaker to manipulate the perception of their actions.

### Conclusion:
The statement "I didn’t steal your pen—I borrowed it" fits the defective argument type **<DEP> (Ambiguous Language Use)**, because the argument relies on the ambiguous interpretation of the word "borrowed" to mitigate the perception of the action as "stealing."

By following these steps, we have decomposed the task of classifying the defective argument (<IDA>) to ascertain that the type of logical fallacy presented here is ambiguous language use (<DEP>).
