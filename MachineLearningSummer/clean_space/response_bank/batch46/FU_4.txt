For 
To classify the given string "Eat lamb--could thousands of coyotes be wrong?" according to the defective argument types defined, we will apply the decomposition process (D) to the task of identifying argument types (IDA). This approach will allow us to methodically determine which defective argument type(s) apply to the given string.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (D) and Application to IDA (IDAA):

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>) in the argument**:
   - The proposition <P> in the string is the implied statement, "You should eat lamb."

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>) provided to support the proposition**:
   - The reason <R> given is, "Thousands of coyotes eat lamb."

3. **Determine if there is a Proof of Reason (<PR>) and what it constitutes**:
   - There is no additional argument provided to corroborate the reason, so <PR> is not explicitly present here.

4. **Analyze the Reason (<R>) for any defective argument types**:
   - Evaluate if the provided Reason (<R>) matches with any of the predefined defective argument types.

5. **Compare the Reason against each defective argument type**:

   - **Generalization (<G>)**: This does not seem to be a generalization of a single part to a whole population.
   
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: The argument does not claim a complete enumeration of possibilities.

   - **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The reason here (coyotes eat lamb) does not directly apply to the proposition (humans eating lamb). It might influence but does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of eating lamb for humans. Coyotes eating lamb does not serve as a strong or appropriate causative reason for the proposition "You should eat lamb."

   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The reason is not compelling as the dietary habits of coyotes do not provide a sufficient basis for human dietary choices, making it weak causally.

   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: This is not just a repetition of the proposition.

   - **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: The argument appeals to the popular behavior of coyotes as if this universally agrees that humans should follow the same, hence a form of presumption.

   - **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**: The language here is clear and unambiguous, so this does not apply.

6. **Determine which defective argument types apply**:
   - The primary types that fit the given argument are **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)** and **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**. The reason provided does not adequately support the proposition, indicating that it is both inconclusive and lacks a compelling causal basis.
   - There is also a mild element of **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**, as it assumes that following what thousands of coyotes do should be universally applicable to humans.

### Conclusion:
By following the systematic decomposition of the task, we conclude that the argument "Eat lamb--could thousands of coyotes be wrong?" primarily represents the defective argument types of **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)** and **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**, with a slight presence of **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**.

The primary classification for this argument would be **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**.
