For 
To apply the IDAA (the application of a systematic decomposition process to classify a defective argument) to the statement "Andrea Starkk has written several books arguing that the media harms women when it comes to body image. But Starkk is an ugly, bitter person, so you shouldn't listen to her.", we need to break down the classification task (IDA) into specific steps (D). Here's the step-by-step approach:

1. **Identify the Proposition (\<P\>):**
   - In this statement, the proposition is: "You shouldn't listen to Andrea Starkk."

2. **Identify the Reason (\<R\>):**
   - The reason given for the proposition is: "Starkk is an ugly, bitter person."

3. **Analyze the Structure of the Reason (Determine the Basis for the Argument):**
   - The reason is an attack on the character of Andrea Starkk rather than addressing the actual argument she made about the media harming women regarding body image.

4. **Match the Argument to Defective Argument Types:**
   - From the list of defective argument types (G, FE, IR, RR, WCB, FU, DEP), determine which one fits the given reason.

    - **Generalization (\<G\>):** This does not involve making a broad generalization.
    - **Incomplete Enumeration (\<FE\>):** This does not involve claiming a false dichotomy.
    - **Inconclusive Reason (\<IR\>):** The reason does not provide a compelling basis to refute the proposition directly.
    - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (\<RR\>):** The reason does not simply restate the proposition.
    - **Insufficient Causal Basis (\<WCB\>):** The causal connection is weak, but itâ€™s not asserting a casual inadequacy directly.
    - **Presumptuous Consensus (\<FU\>):** This does not appeal to a presumed consensus.
    - **Ambiguous Language Use (\<DEP\>):** The reason does not involve ambiguous language.

5. **Determine the Correct Defective Argument Type:**
   - The appropriate defective argument type for this statement is **Inconclusive Reason (\<IR\>)**.

    - The reason provided ("Starkk is an ugly, bitter person") does not address the validity of Starkk's arguments about the media and body image. Instead, it attacks her character, which is a classic example of an ad hominem fallacy (a type of <IR>), where the argument becomes defective because it attacks the person rather than addressing the substance of their argument.

Thus, the application of IDAA to the given string results in the classification: **\<IR\>**.
