To apply the decomposition of classifying a string as one of the defined defective argument types to the given argument, we'll break down the process into specific steps:

### Decomposition of the Task (D)
1. **Identify the Proposition (P):** Determine the primary assertion or claim in the statement.
2. **Identify the Reason (R):** Identify the causal basis presented to support the proposition.
3. **Classify the Argument Type:** Match the identified proposition and reason to one of the predefined defective argument types.
    - Generalization (G)
    - Incomplete Enumeration (FE)
    - Inconclusive Reason (IR)
    - Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)
    - Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)
    - Presumptuous Consensus (FU)
    - Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)

### Application of Decomposition to Classification (IDAA)

**Step-by-Step Process:**

1. **Identify the Proposition (P):**
   - Proposition (P): "You must find him guilty."

2. **Identify the Reason (R):**
   - Reason (R): "The defendant has been able to provide no strong evidence to prove his innocence."

3. **Classify the Argument Type:**
   - Compare the structure of the argument to the provided defective argument types:
   
   Let's break down the reason in detail:
   - The reason provided is centered around the defendant's lack of evidence for innocence. It assumes that absence of evidence is equivalent to proof of guilt.
   
   - This immediately reminds us of the concept of "incomplete enumeration" because it ignores the other possibilities such as the prosecution's failure to provide sufficient evidence for guilt (shifting the burden of proof incorrectly).

   - It doesn't match Generalization (G) as it doesn't make a sweeping assertion based on a subset.
   - It's not an Inconclusive Reason (IR) as the reason here is the absence of evidence, which leads directly to the flawed conclusion and not the quality of the evidence presented.
   - It's not Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB) because the causal connection here is specifically about the burden of proof, not the strength of a causal basis.
   - It's not a Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR) because the reason presented is not tautological; it presents absence of proof rather than restating guilt.
   - It's not a Presumptuous Consensus (FU) since there's no appeal to universal agreement.
   - It's not an Ambiguous Language Use (DEP) because the argument isn't relying on ambiguous language or misunderstanding of a term.
   
   - Based on the analysis, the argument classifies most closely as Incomplete Enumeration (FE), since it assumes only two possibilities: providing strong evidence for innocence or being found guilty, thereby omitting other crucial aspects like the need for the prosecution to meet the burden of proof.

**Therefore, the given argument "Your Honor, the defendant has been able to provide no strong evidence to prove his innocence; therefore, you must find him guilty."** is of type **<FE> (Incomplete Enumeration)**.
