For 
To apply <IDAA> to the string "We can’t freeze the academic year because then students won’t graduate on time. Next thing you know most people will be unemployed and will resort to crime. The crime rate will skyrocket and society will collapse.", we need to decompose this advanced task into specific steps and classify the string as one of the defective argument types defined: <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>. 

### Decomposition <D> into Specific Steps:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>)**: Determine the main assertion that is intended to be proved.
2. **Identify the Reason (<R>)**: Determine the causal basis provided for the proposition.
3. **Determine if <R> is conclusive (<IR>)**: Evaluate if the reason conclusively supports the proposition.
4. **Check for Generalization (<G>)**: See if the proposition applies a generalization to a specific group based on insufficient data.
5. **Check for Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: Determine if the reason misses out on other pertinent possibilities.
6. **Check for Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: Evaluate if the causal basis is weak or not compelling.
7. **Check for Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: Determine if the reason essentially repeats the proposition.
8. **Check for Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: See if a proof of reason is assumed to be true based on supposed universal agreement without dispute.
9. **Check for Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**: Determine if the language used can be misleading or taken in another sense than intended.

### Applying <IDAA> to the Given String:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>)**:
   - The main assertion here is: "We can’t freeze the academic year."
   
2. **Identify the Reason (<R>)**:
   - The causal basis given is: "Then students won’t graduate on time. Next thing you know most people will be unemployed and will resort to crime. The crime rate will skyrocket and society will collapse."

3. **Determine if <R> is conclusive (<IR>)**:
   - The reasons given do not strictly follow in a logical sequence that conclusively supports the proposition. There are large assumed leaps between each step (students not graduating -> unemployment -> crime -> collapse of society).
   
4. **Check for Generalization (<G>)**:
   - The argument involves a slippery slope but doesn’t appear to be making a general statement based on an insufficient sample size.
   
5. **Check for Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**:
   - The argument doesn't really claim a complete enumeration of possibilities but focuses on a causative chain.
   
6. **Check for Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**:
   - The reasons provided (students not graduating on time leading to society's collapse) are weak and involve speculative leaps. The causal basis is not strong enough or compelling.
   
7. **Check for Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**:
   - The string does not merely repeat the proposition as the reason.
   
8. **Check for Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**:
   - The argument does not appeal to popular opinion or universal agreement as the basis for the proposition.
   
9. **Check for Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**:
   - The language in the string is not ambiguous, but rather, it speculates on a chain of events.

### Classification:

Based on the steps and analysis, the defective argument type that best fits the given string is:

**<WCB> - Insufficient Causal Basis**.

The causal basis provided for the proposition "We can't freeze the academic year" is not compelling enough, as it assumes an exaggerated and speculative chain of events leading to societal collapse.
