To apply the process of decomposing and identifying the logical fallacy (IDAA) in the given statement "Grace and Helen were both romantically interested in Brad. One day, with Brad sitting within earshot, Grace asked in an inquisitive tone whether Helen was still having problems with her drug habit.", we will break down the task into specific steps and then classify the argument according to the defined types:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (D) of IDAA:
1. **Identify** the proposition (<P>) and reason (<R>) within the argument, if present.
2. **Analyze** whether the proposition and reason fit any of the defective argument types (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>).
3. **Compare** the structure of the argument with the definitions of defective argument types: 
    - Generalization (<G>)
    - Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)
    - Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)
    - Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)
    - Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)
    - Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)
    - Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)
4. **Classify** the argument into the identified defective argument type based on the comparison.

### Application of IDAA:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>) and Reason (<R>):**
    - Here, the statement itself does not explicitly provide a <P> and <R> directly. Instead, it implies an assertion indirectly. 
    - Grace’s question, "Is Helen still having problems with her drug habit?" does not directly indicate a <P> intended for logical analysis but suggests a tacit assertion.

2. **Analyze the Argument:**
    - Grace’s inquiry implies a proposition (Helen has a drug habit).
    - The reason seems to be suggested by asking about the “still having problems,” implying an ongoing issue rather than a resolved one.

3. **Compare with Defective Argument Types:**
    - **Generalization (<G>)** does not fit since the statement does not generalize a characteristic of a group.
    - **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)** is not applicable here.
    - **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)** does not fully align because it is not providing an insufficient reason but making an indirect assertion.
    - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)** is not relevant as there is no repetition.
    - **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)** does not apply since the causal basis is not weak but the question is more suggestive.
    - **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)** is not relevant because it involves a direct claim of universal agreement.
    - **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)** seems most fitting, as the statement can be interpreted in different ways, causing ambiguity, particularly around the "drug habit."

4. **Classify the Argument:**
    - The argument is a form of indirect suggestion that creates ambiguity about Helen’s situation. The statement utilizes a loaded question aimed at implying a negative assumption about Helen.
    - It fits best with **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**: The statement, though framed as a question, can be taken to imply Helen’s continued drug problem, making it ambiguous in intent and interpretation.

Thus, by applying the method of IDAA, **"Grace and Helen were both romantically interested in Brad. One day, with Brad sitting within earshot, Grace asked in an inquisitive tone whether Helen was still having problems with her drug habit."** can be classified as <DEP> (Ambiguous Language Use) due to its suggestive and potentially misleading nature.
