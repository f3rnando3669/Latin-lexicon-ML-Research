For 
Let's apply <IDAA> to classify the string "I guess I should buy my 12-year-old daughter an iPhone. Everyone at her new school has one and I want her to fit in with the other kids."

### Step-by-step Decomposition:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
   The proposition in this argument is: "I should buy my 12-year-old daughter an iPhone."

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   The reason given for the proposition is: "Everyone at her new school has one and I want her to fit in with the other kids."

3. **Check for Defective Argument Types:**
   - **Generalization (<G>):** This involves applying a specific case or majority to all. Here, the assertion isn't about applying to all kids, just those at the new school. So, this doesn't fit.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** This involves claiming limited choices while missing others. This isn't the case here either.
   - **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** This is when the reason doesn't conclusively support the proposition. The reason does directly support the argument to some extent but it's not necessarily the most logical or strong support.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** This involves weak causal reasoning. The reasoning here is social pressure or norms, which is weak but not really a causal basis.
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** The reason isn't just a repetition of the proposition.
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** This argument presumes consensus— "Everyone at her new school has one"—as a compelling reason, though it might not be universally valid or conclusive.
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** The language isn't ambiguous in the sense being analyzed.

4. **Classification (<IDA>):**
   Since the argument relies on the popularity of iPhones among her schoolmates to justify the proposition, it is an example of **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**.

### Final Classification:
The argument "I guess I should buy my 12-year-old daughter an iPhone. Everyone at her new school has one and I want her to fit in with the other kids." fits under the defective argument type <FU> (Presumptuous Consensus).
