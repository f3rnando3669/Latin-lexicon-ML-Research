For 
To apply IDAA to "the following is an example of...", we will decompose the task of classifying this string as one of the identified defective argument types step by step. Here is how we can break it down:

1. **Understand the Problem Statement:**
   - **Task:** Classify the string as one of the defective argument types.
   - **String:** "the following is an example of..."

2. **Identify Key Steps for Classification (D):**
   - Step 1: Extract the essential part of the string.
   - Step 2: Analyze the argument or statement presented.
   - Step 3: Compare/analyze the argument against definitions of all defective argument types.
   - Step 4: Make a determination based on the most fitting defective argument type definition.

3. **Applying Specific Steps (IDAA):**

### Step 1: Extract the Essential Part of the String
- Current string: "the following is an example of..."
- The string seems incomplete. To evaluate it fully, we would traditionally need the complete context.

### Step 2: Analyze the Argument or Statement Presented
- Given string: "the following is an example of..."
- This phrase typically introduces an example or continuation of a specific point, but without additional content, the argument or proposition cannot be fully assessed.

### Step 3: Compare/Analyze the Argument Against Definitions of Defective Argument Types
Without the continuation, an exact match is speculative. However, we attempt to hypothesize potential defective argument types that begin with "the following is an example of...".

1. **Generalization (G)**
   - Hypothesis of generic common scenario.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**
   - Limited options might follow.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**
   - Potential for non-compelling support.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**
   - Causal claims without proper support.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**
   - Redundancy potential.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**
   - Assuming something as true universally without proof.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**
   - Unclear meaning or dual interpretation.

### Step 4: Make a Determination Based on Fit to Defective Argument Type
Since the string "the following is an example of..." is incomplete, we will assume the analysis as hypothetical toward definitions provided:
- Best Fitting Type: Incomplete Enumeration (FE). Often leading to missing relevant examples/settings after the phrase "the following is an example..."

### Result:
The classification of "the following is an example of..." based on the provided context, steps, and definitions can most closely align with **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)** due to the implied notion of providing limited examples and potentially missing out important ones.

This is the step-by-step application of IDAA to determine that "the following is an example of..." falls under the defective argument type of **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)** if continued in limited or insufficient enumeration.
