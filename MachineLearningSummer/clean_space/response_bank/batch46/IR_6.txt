For 
To apply <IDAA> (the decomposition approach) to the task <IDA> (classifying the given string as one of the defective argument types), let's proceed step by step.

### Step 1: Understanding the Given String

The given string is:
"Richard Dawkins, an evolutionary biologist and perhaps the foremost expert in the field, says that evolution is true. Therefore, it's true."

### Step 2: Breaking Down the Components of the Argument

1. **Proposition (<P>)**: The main assertion in the argument.
   - In this case, the main assertion is: "Evolution is true."

2. **Reason (<R>)**: The justification or basis provided for the proposition.
   - Here, the reason seems to be: "Richard Dawkins, an expert, says that evolution is true."

3. **Proof of Reason (<PR>)**: Additional support for the reason provided.
   - The argument seems to rely solely on the authority of Richard Dawkins rather than providing additional proofs.

### Step 3: Identifying the Type of Defective Argument

Let's evaluate the argument against the defective argument types:

- **<G> Generalization**: This doesn't fit because it doesn't generalize from a part to the whole.
- **<FE> Incomplete Enumeration**: This doesn't fit because it doesn't claim a complete set of possibilities.
- **<IR> Inconclusive Reason**: This seems plausible because the argument relies on authority rather than actual evidence. However, let's check other categories too.
- **<WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis**: This isn't about a weak causal basis but rather authority as proof.
- **<RR> Faulty Repetition of Proposition**: This isn't repeating the same proposition as the reason.
- **<FU> Presumptuous Consensus**: This argues from authority rather than universal consensus.
- **<DEP> Ambiguous Language Use**: The language isn't ambiguous.

### Conclusion

After evaluating the given string against the defective argument types, the most fitting classification is:

**<IR> Inconclusive Reason**: The reason provided does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition. It relies solely on the authority of Richard Dawkins without actual evidence of the truth of evolution.

### Final Step
Clearly state the classification:
"Richard Dawkins, an evolutionary biologist and perhaps the foremost expert in the field, says that evolution is true. Therefore, it's true." is of type **<IR>** (Inconclusive Reason).
