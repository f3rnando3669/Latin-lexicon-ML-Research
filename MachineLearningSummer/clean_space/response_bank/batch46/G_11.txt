For 
To apply <IDAA> (the application of decomposing the task of classifying a string as one of the defective argument types), we need to follow a structured approach. Below are the steps involved in breaking down the task (D) and applying it to the given string “Some students who attend tutoring over the summer are not very intelligent. Since Beth attended summer tutoring, she is not a very good student.”

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>), Reason (<R>), and Proof of Reason (<PR>)
- **Proposition (P):** Beth is not a very good student.
- **Reason (R):** Some students who attend tutoring over the summer are not very intelligent.
- **Proof of Reason (PR):** Beth attended summer tutoring.

### Step 2: Analyze the Structure of the Argument
- **Argument Summary:**
  - Claim: Beth is not a very good student (P).
  - Justification: Some students who attend tutoring over the summer are not very intelligent (R).
  - Supporting Fact: Beth attended summer tutoring (PR).

### Step 3: Check for Generalization (<G>)
- **Generalization Test:**
  - The given statement makes a broad generalization about students attending summer tutoring and applies it to Beth. This aligns with the defect of making a statement about a subgroup (some students) and applying it to an individual (Beth).

### Step 4: Check for Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)
- **Incomplete Enumeration Test:**
  - The argument does not claim to enumerate all possibilities but rather relies on a generalization based on some observations. Hence, this step is irrelevant.

### Step 5: Check for Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)
- **Inconclusive Reason Test:**
  - The reasoning here is not about the conclusive demonstration of Beth's intelligence per se but about applying a generalization. 

### Step 6: Check for Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)
- **Insufficient Causal Basis Test:**
  - The causal basis here is weak, but the main issue is more about the generalization than the sufficiency of the causal basis.

### Step 7: Check for Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)
- **Faulty Repetition Test:**
  - There is no repetition of the proposition as a reason.

### Step 8: Check for Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)
- **Presumptuous Consensus Test:**
  - There is no claim of universal agreement; the argument relies on a generalization.

### Step 9: Check for Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)
- **Ambiguous Language Test:**
  - The language used is not ambiguous but rather a clear (albeit flawed) generalization.

### Step 10: Conclude the Classification
- Given the analysis, the argument fits into the type <G> (Generalization) because it takes a general observation about a subgroup (some students who attend summer tutoring) and applies it to an individual (Beth).

### Final Classification
- **Classification (<IDA>):** <G> (Generalization).
