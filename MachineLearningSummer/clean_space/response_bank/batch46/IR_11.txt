For 
To apply <IDAA> to the argument contained in the statement "The Supreme Court right now is deciding whether it is right to execute insane people who have committed murder. I think it is all right to execute insane people. If we ban executions of insane people, then everybody on death row will suddenly decide they are insane and purposely fail sanity tests. It would result in chaos," we perform the following steps:

**Step 1: Decompose the classification task <IDA> into specific steps <D>.**

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
   - Determine the main assertion or claim put forth in the argument.

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   - Identify the causal basis or reasoning provided to support the Proposition.

3. **Classify the Reason and Proof of Reason as defective types if present:**
   - Analyze the argument to see if the identified <R> and any subsequent <PR> exhibit characteristics of the defective argument types defined: <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>.

**Step 2: Apply the decomposition steps to the given statement.**

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
   - The main claim in the argument is: "I think it is all right to execute insane people."

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   - The reasoning given to support the proposition is: "If we ban executions of insane people, then everybody on death row will suddenly decide they are insane and purposely fail sanity tests. It would result in chaos."

3. **Classify the Reason (<R>) and Proof of Reason (<PR>) as defective types if present:**
   - **Generalization (<G>):** The argument does not seem to be a generalization since it does not make an assertion about a whole group based on a part.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** The argument does not present a list of possibilities but focuses on a specific outcome.
   - **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** The reasoning provided does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition. It assumes that banning executions would definitely lead to manipulations of insanity claims, without sufficient evidence for such a sweeping outcome. This reasoning creates an assertion that is not firmly established.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** The causal link between banning executions and resulting chaos is weak and not compellingly supported.
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** The reason does not merely repeat the proposition but offers an additional scenario.
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** The reason given does not rely on the presumption of universal agreement.
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):** The language used is clear and does not lead to interpretations different from the intended meaning.

**Conclusion:**
Based on our analysis, the argument primarily falls under defective argument type:
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** The reasoning provided (response to banning executions leading to manipulated insanity claims and chaos) is weak and does not compellingly support the proposition.

Thus, the argument "The Supreme Court right now is deciding whether it is right to execute insane people who have committed murder. I think it is all right to execute insane people. If we ban executions of insane people, then everybody on death row will suddenly decide they are insane and purposely fail sanity tests. It would result in chaos" is classified as <WCB>.
