For 
To apply the concept of IDAA (the application of decomposition into specific steps for the task of classifying a string into one of the defective argument types) to the string "Is your stupidity inborn?", we will follow a structured approach to break down and classify the argument. 

Here is the decomposition (D) applied to IDA:

1. **Identify** the main proposition (P) in the given argument.
2. **Analyze** the reasoning (R) provided to support the proposition.
3. **Evaluate** whether the reasoning provided is sufficient or if it fits into one of the defective argument types.
4. **Classify** the argument under the appropriate defective argument type if it matches any predefined categories (G, FE, IR, WCB, RR, FU, DEP).

Let's apply this to the string "Is your stupidity inborn?":

### Step-by-Step Analysis (IDAA):

1. **Identify the Proposition (P):**
   - The string "Is your stupidity inborn?" implies a proposition that the person being addressed has an inherent stupidity. 

2. **Analyze the Reasoning (R):**
   - The string is presented as a question but carries a loaded assertion that the person's stupidity might be inherent (inborn).
   - There is an implied argument here: if the person is stupid, it must be due to an inborn trait, but no explicit reasoning is provided.

3. **Evaluate the Reasoning (R):**
   - In this case, the reasoning is not honestly presented. The question implies an assumption without providing any foundational basis or reason for such an assertion.
   - The implied R (that the person is inherently stupid) is not substantiated by any argument or evidence.

4. **Classify the Argument (IDA):**
   - Given the lack of provided reasoning and the misleading nature of the question, the argument could be viewed as:
     - **IR (Inconclusive Reason):** The reason implied by the question does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition.
     - **RR (Faulty Repetition of Proposition):** There is an attempt to present inherent stupidity as the causal reason without any supporting argument.
     - **DEP (Ambiguous Language Use):** The use of "stupidity" might suggest a pejorative assumption about intellectual capability without clear context.

However, the most straightforward classification is **IDAA (Inconclusive Reason or IR)**:
- The argument asked in the form of a question does not provide any concrete reason for the proposition that stupidity might be inborn; it is simply a loaded question. Therefore, it is an example of:
  - **IR (Inconclusive Reason):** Because the implied reasoning in the question does not conclusively support any specific assertion about the proposition, it's considered inconclusive reasoning.

So, the classification of "Is your stupidity inborn?" under IDA would be:
- **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason)**
