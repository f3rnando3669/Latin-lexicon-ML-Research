For 
To apply <IDAA> to the statement "You can tell that guy's Mexican - he's wearing a sombrero," we will decompose the advanced task <IDA> (classifying the statement) into specific steps.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition of <IDA>:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>), Reason (<R>), and Proof of Reason (<PR>) in the statement:**
   - Proposition (<P>): "That guy is Mexican."
   - Reason (<R>): "He's wearing a sombrero."
   - Proof of Reason (<PR>): Not explicitly provided in the statement.

2. **Analyze the given statement to determine which type of defective argument it represents. Review definitions:**
   - <G>: Generalization - asserting something about all based on a part.
   - <FE>: Incomplete Enumeration - missing relevant possibilities.
   - <IR>: Inconclusive Reason - reason does not fully support proposition.
   - <WCB>: Insufficient Causal Basis - reason given is weak.
   - <RR>: Faulty Repetition of Proposition - reason is a restatement of proposition.
   - <FU>: Presumptuous Consensus - assuming something is true because it is universally agreed upon.
   - <DEP>: Ambiguous Language Use - statement can be interpreted in multiple ways.

3. **Match the statement to the relevant defective argument type:**
   - The proposition "That guy is Mexican" is being made based solely on the observation that "he's wearing a sombrero."
   - This reasoning involves drawing a conclusion about the person's nationality based on a stereotypical feature, which is an overgeneralization.

4. **Determine if the reason (<R>) conclusively supports the proposition (<P>):**
   - Wearing a sombrero does not conclusively indicate a person is Mexican; it is a stereotype, and not all Mexicans wear sombreros, nor do all people who wear sombreros have to be Mexican.

5. **Classify the argument:**
   - The statement is a typical example of a generalization wherein one attribute (wearing a sombrero) is wrongly extended to a whole identity (being Mexican).

### Classification:
The statement "You can tell that guy's Mexican - he's wearing a sombrero" fits the defective argument type <G> (Generalization).

By decomposing the task and following through the steps systematically (in line with <IDAA>), we achieve the classification:
- **The statement is of type <G> (Generalization).**
