For 
To classify the statement "Only a mentally ill person would kill someone, so anyone who kills someone is automatically mentally ill." according to <IDA>, we will follow the steps according to the method <IDAA> which involves decomposing the task (<D>) and then applying it to the classification task (<IDA>).

### Decomposition of the Task <t> (Classification Task <IDA>):
1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>)**: Determine the main claim or assertion made in the statement.
2. **Identify the Reason (<R>)**: Determine the causal basis or supporting statement provided for the main claim.
3. **Classify the Defective Argument Type**: Analyze the argument to see which defective argument type (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>) the statement falls under.

### Step-by-Step Application (<IDAA>):

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>)**:
   - Proposition: "Anyone who kills someone is automatically mentally ill."

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>)**:
   - Reason: "Only a mentally ill person would kill someone."

3. **Classify the Defective Argument Type**:

   - **Generalization (<G>)**: The statement is making a broad assertion about all individuals who commit killings based on the assumption that only mentally ill people would do such an act. It fits the definition of a generalization because it is applying an observation about some individuals (those who might be mentally ill and commit killings) to all individuals who commit the act.
   
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: The statement could imply there are only two possibilities (mental illness and killing), but it does not explicitly state a complete enumeration of all possible reasons.
   
   - **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The reasoning does not conclusively prove the proposition as it assumes a direct causal relationship without sufficient evidence. 
   
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The causal basis (only mentally ill people would kill) is a weak one without strong empirical evidence to universally support this claim.
   
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: There does not appear to be repetition of the proposition as the reason given doesn't just restate the proposition.
   
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: The statement doesn't rely on supposed universal agreement as its proof.
   
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**: The language used in the argument is relatively clear and focuses on mental illness and killing without ambiguity.

After considering the definitions and examples provided for each defective argument type, the best classification for this argument appears to be **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)** and **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**. The statement provides reasoning that does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition and the causal basis presented is weak and not sufficiently compelling.

Therefore, based on the analysis:

### Classification:
The statement "Only a mentally ill person would kill someone, so anyone who kills someone is automatically mentally ill." falls under:

- **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason)**
- **<WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis)**

These classifications indicate the argument is defective because the reasoning does not conclusively support the proposition and the causal basis for the claim is insufficiently compelling.
