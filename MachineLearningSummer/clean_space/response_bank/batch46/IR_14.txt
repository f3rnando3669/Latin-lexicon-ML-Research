For 
The task is to classify the string "Did John ever give up his bad habits?" as one of the types of defective arguments. Using <IDAA>, we decompose the advanced task of classifying the string into specific steps and then apply those steps.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (<D>):

1. **Understand the Content of the String (<s>):**
   - Examine the string "Did John ever give up his bad habits?" to understand its content and implied context.

2. **Identify Key Elements:**
   - Determine if the string contains elements of any specific defective argument types such as Proposition (<P>), Reason (<R>), or Proof of Reason (<PR>).

3. **Check for Defective Argument Indicators:**
   - Analyze the string for the presence of any common indicators of defective arguments (jumping to conclusions, lacking evidence, using ambiguous language, etc.).

4. **Match with Defective Argument Types:**
   - Compare the identified elements and indicators with the defined defective argument types: <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>.

5. **Classify the String:**
   - Assign the string to one of the defective argument types based on the comparison in the previous step.

### Application of <IDAA>:

1. **Understand the Content of the String (<s>):**
   - "Did John ever give up his bad habits?" appears to be a question implying that John has bad habits and questioning whether he has given them up.

2. **Identify Key Elements:**
   - The string poses an implied assumption (Proposition <P>) that John has bad habits. It does not provide a clear Reason (<R>) or Proof of Reason (<PR>).

3. **Check for Defective Argument Indicators:**
   - The string presumes the existence of "bad habits" without presenting any evidence or reasoning to support this presumption.
   - It also frames the question in a way that assumes an answer, creating a potentially false dilemma.

4. **Match with Defective Argument Types:**
   - The main defect appears to be a presumptive assumption that John has bad habits, without evidence. This fits the definition of a presumptive consensus, where something is assumed to be true based on an implicit or supposed universal agreement.

5. **Classify the String:**
   - Based on the analysis, the string matches the characteristics of <FU> (Presumptuous Consensus).

### Conclusion:
The string "Did John ever give up his bad habits?" is classified as type <FU> (Presumptuous Consensus), as it assumes something about John (that he has bad habits) without providing evidence and is framed in a way that such an assumption could be considered universally accepted or agreed upon.
