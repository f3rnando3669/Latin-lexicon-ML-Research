For 
To apply <IDAA> to the statement "Ghosts exist.... because I saw a ghost in my closet" and determine what logical fallacy it represents, we need to decompose the task of classifying the string into specific steps. Hereâ€™s the step-by-step breakdown:

### Decomposition (<D>) of the Classification Task (<IDA>)

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>) in the statement:**
   - The proposition is the claim that the speaker intends to prove. Here, that would be: "Ghosts exist."

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>) presented to support the Proposition:**
   - The reason provided by the speaker is: "because I saw a ghost in my closet."

3. **Analyze if the Reason (<R>) is sufficient or suffers from any defects to establish the Proposition (<P>):**
   - Determine if the reason given would logically support the proposition.
   - Check for any signs of defective arguments using the defined types: <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>.

### Application of <D> to the Given Statement ("Ghosts exist.... because I saw a ghost in my closet")

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
   - "Ghosts exist."

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   - "because I saw a ghost in my closet."

3. **Analyze the Reason (<R>) for Defects:**
   - The reason relies on the speaker's personal experience to support a universal claim.
   - Evaluate the reason based on the types of defective arguments:

   **Generalization (<G>):**
   - A generalization occurs when a general statement is made based on a single or limited observation.
   - Here, the speaker is asserting the existence of ghosts based on a single personal experience.

**Conclusion:**
The reasoning provided ("because I saw a ghost in my closet") is making a general claim "Ghosts exist" based on a single instance. This fits the definition of a **Generalization (<G>)**. Therefore, the classification of the statement is of type <G>.

### Final Classification:
"Ghosts exist.... because I saw a ghost in my closet" is an example of a **Generalization (G)** logical fallacy.
