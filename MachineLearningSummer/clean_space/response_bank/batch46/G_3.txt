To apply the IDAA (application of the decomposition of the classification task) to the statement "An environmental group illegally blocked loggers and workers at a nuclear plant. Therefore, environmentalists are radicals who take the law into their own hands." let's break down the task step by step.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition of the Task (D):

1. **Identify the Proposition (P):**
   - Extract the core claim or statement that is intended to be proven.
   
2. **Identify the Reason (R):**
   - Determine the causal basis or reason provided for the proposition.
   
3. **Identify the Proof of Reason (PR):**
   - Find any additional arguments or evidences that support the reason.
   
4. **Classify the Argument:**
   - Based on the definitions of defective argument types (G, FE, IR, RR, WCB, FU, DEP), identify if the argument fits into any of these categories.
   
5. **Verify Correctness:**
   - Ensure that the classification logically aligns with the given definitions and the structure of the argument.

### Application of Decomposition to the Statement:

#### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (P)
Proposition (P): "Environmentalists are radicals who take the law into their own hands."

#### Step 2: Identify the Reason (R)
Reason (R): "An environmental group illegally blocked loggers and workers at a nuclear plant."

#### Step 3: Identify the Proof of Reason (PR)
Proof of Reason (PR): There is no additional proof provided in the statement; it relies on the single incident mentioned.

#### Step 4: Classify the Argument
Using the criteria for defective arguments, we need to check if the proposition and the reason fall into one of the defective categories.

- **Generalization (G):** The P is an assertion generalized from the actions of "an environmental group" to all "environmentalists".
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE):** This does not seem to claim a complete enumeration of possibilities.
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR):** The reason provided does not seem to conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB):** The causal basis provided does not seem compelling enough to generalize about all environmentalists.
- **Faulty Repetition (RR):** The reason does not just repeat the proposition.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU):** There is no mention of universal agreement.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP):** It does not seem the language is ambiguous or can be taken in another sense.

#### Step 5: Verify Correctness
The statement "Environmentalists are radicals who take the law into their own hands." is drawing a broad generalization based on a specific incident involving an "environmental group."

### Conclusion from Classification
The argument fits the type of **Generalization (G)** because it takes the actions of a specific group and applies them broadly to all environmentalists without sufficient evidence to support such a wide-reaching claim.

Therefore, the classification of the statement "An environmental group illegally blocked loggers and workers at a nuclear plant. Therefore, environmentalists are radicals who take the law into their own hands." as per IDAA is of type **<G>**.
