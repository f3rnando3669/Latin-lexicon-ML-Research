For 
To apply **<IDAA>** (the application of **<D>** to **<IDA>**) to classify the string **s**, "After Sally presents an eloquent and compelling case for a more equitable taxation system, Sam asks the audience whether we should believe anything from a woman who isn't married, was once arrested, and smells a bit weird.", let's decompose and follow each step methodically.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition

**Step 1: Identify the primary proposition (<P>)**
- **P** here is likely related to the topic Sally is advocating for: "a more equitable taxation system."

**Step 2: Determine what part of the argument raises a concern**
- Sam's response does not engage directly with Sally’s arguments about taxation. Instead, it questions her credibility based on personal attributes and unrelated incidents.

**Step 3: Classify the logical fallacy based on descriptions given for each category**
- **(G)** Generalization: N/A. This does not relate to a generalized assertion.
- **(FE)** Incomplete Enumeration: N/A. This does not involve missing out on possibilities.
- **(IR)** Inconclusive Reason: Evaluates **R** – Here, Sally’s personal life and characteristics do not logically affect the argument about equitable taxation.
- **(WCB)** Insufficient Causal Basis: N/A. This does not involve weak causality.
- **(RR)** Faulty Repetition of Proposition: N/A. This does not involve mere repetition.
- **(FU)** Presumptuous Consensus: N/A. This does not invoke universal agreement or popular opinion.
- **(DEP)** Ambiguous Language Use: N/A. No ambiguous language in the sense of misunderstood terminology.

**Step 4: Final classification**
- **IR** Inconclusive Reason: Sam's argument shifts the focus from the actual proposition of equitable taxation to attacking Sally’s personal life, which is irrelevant to the merits of her proposition.

### Conclusion
Therefore, according to the predefined categories, the string **s** falls under the defective argument type **<IR>** (Inconclusive Reason).

### Summary
By decomposing the task into identifying the relevant parts of the argument and examining whether each fallacy applies, we systematically classify the string as **<IR>** due to the irrelevance of personal attacks in relation to the argument being presented.
