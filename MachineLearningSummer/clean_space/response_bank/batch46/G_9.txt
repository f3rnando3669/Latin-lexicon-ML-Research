For 
To apply <IDAA> to the given string, we need to take the advanced task of classifying the string into one of the defective argument types and decompose it into specific steps. Here’s how we can approach it:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
   - Determine the main assertion or claim that the argument is trying to establish.

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   - Look for the causal basis or reasoning provided to support the proposition.

3. **Examine the Proof of Reason (<PR>):**
   - Identify any additional arguments or evidence that are presented to corroborate the reason.

4. **Classify the Defective Argument:**
   - Review the argument with the definitions of the defective argument types in mind.
   - Determine if the argument falls into any of the classifications based on its structure and content.

### Application of <IDAA> to the Given String:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
   - The main assertion here seems to be that one should take the story of Adam and Eve literally to avoid becoming an atheist and engaging in immoral behavior.

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   - The reason given is a slippery slope: accepting the Adam and Eve story as figurative will lead to questioning other biblical stories, resulting in disbelief in Christianity, loss of morals, and then immoral behavior.

3. **Examine the Proof of Reason (<PR>):**
   - The proof here includes a series of cause-and-effect statements linking the acceptance of a figurative interpretation to extreme consequences (becoming an atheist, losing morals, engaging in bestiality).

4. **Classify the Defective Argument:**
   - Review the definitions of defective argument types:
     - **Generalization (G)**: Not applicable; it’s not making a broad assertion from insufficient evidence.
     - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: Not applicable; it’s not an exhaustive list with missing possibilities.
     - **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: Potentially applicable; the reasoning does not necessarily follow logically and conclusively to the extreme outcomes.
     - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: This seems closely related; the causal links provided are extremely weak and not compelling.
     - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: Not applicable; the reason is not merely repeating the proposition.
     - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: Not directly applicable; it doesn’t appeal to popularity or universal agreement.
     - **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: Not applicable; the language is not ambiguous.

Based on this analysis, the most fitting classification for the argument is:

### Classification: <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis)

The causal links provided in the argument (accepting a figurative interpretation of the story of Adam and Eve leading to atheism and immoral behavior) are very weak and not compelling, thus making the argument fall under the category of Insufficient Causal Basis.

So, the string "If you accept that the story of Adam and Eve was figurative, then you will do the same for most of the Old Testament stories of similar literary styles. Once you are there, the New Testament and the story of Jesus does not make sense, which will lead you to believe that the resurrection of Jesus was a “spiritual” one. Once you accept that, you won’t be a Christian anymore; you will be a dirty atheist, then you will have no morals and start having sex with animals of a barnyard nature. So you better take the story of Adam and Eve literally, before the phrase, “that chicken looks delicious”, takes on a whole new meaning." is classified as <WCB>.
