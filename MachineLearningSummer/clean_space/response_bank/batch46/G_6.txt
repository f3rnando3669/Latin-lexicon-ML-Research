For 
To apply <IDAA> (the application of the decomposition process <D> to the task of classifying a statement <s>), we need to identify the defective argument type present in the statement "Religion may have been wrong about a few things, but science has been wrong about many more things!" Let's outline the steps for decomposition and then apply them to the classification task:

1. **Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)**:
   - What is the main assertion of the argument?

2. **Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)**:
   - What is the causal basis given to support the proposition?

3. **Step 3: Identify the type of support or Proof of Reason (<PR>)**:
   - Are there additional arguments given to corroborate the reason?

4. **Step 4: Compare the argument structure against defective argument types**:
   - Evaluate the argument to see if it matches any definitions of defective argument types: <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>.

5. **Step 5: Classify the argument**:
   - Based on the comparison, classify the defective argument type.

Now let's apply these steps to the given statement.

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)
The main assertion of the argument is:
- "Religion may have been wrong about a few things, but science has been wrong about many more things!"

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)
The causal basis given to support the proposition is:
- "Science has been wrong about many more things."

### Step 3: Identify the type of support or Proof of Reason (<PR>)
There are no additional arguments given to corroborate the reason in the statement. The argument structure is essentially a direct comparison.

### Step 4: Compare the argument structure against defective argument types
1. **<G> Generalization**: The proposition does not generalize from one part to all individuals.
2. **<FE> Incomplete Enumeration**: The statement does not claim to enumerate all possibilities; rather, it is comparing two fields.
3. **<IR> Inconclusive Reason**: The reason does not seem to conclusively support the proposition, but it is not clear if this fits best.
4. **<RR> Faulty Repetition of Proposition**: The reason is not an exact repetition of the proposition.
5. **<WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis**: The reasoning does not establish a strong causal link for the proposition.
6. **<FU> Presumptuous Consensus**: The statement does not appeal to popularity or consensus.
7. **<DEP> Ambiguous Language Use**: There is no apparent ambiguity in the language used.

### Step 5: Classify the argument
The argument seems to imply that because science has been wrong more times than religion, it makes religion's errors less significant. This does not logically follow and does not provide a conclusive basis for the proposition. The argument is comparing two different domains of activity without providing specific, credible reasons why the quantity of errors in one domain is relevant to the other domainâ€™s validity.

Thus, the classification of this defective argument type is most likely:

**<IR> Inconclusive Reason**.

The reason provided does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition. The mere fact that science has been wrong more times does not logically negate or affect the correctness or credibility of religious claims.
