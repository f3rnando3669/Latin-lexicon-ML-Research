For 
To apply IDAA to classify the statement "You must obey the law, because it's illegal to break the law," we will decompose the task into specific steps. Here's a step-by-step decomposition (D) of the IDA task for classification:

1. **Identify the Proposition (P):**
   - The statement to be proved or argued.

2. **Identify the Reason (R):**
   - The causal basis presented to support the Proposition.

3. **Examine if the Reason conclusively supports the Proposition:**
   - Determine if the Reason establishes the truth of the Proposition firmly.

4. **Determine if there is any Proof of Reason (PR) and its nature:**
   - Look for additional arguments supporting the Reason.

5. **Classify the detected fallacy:**
   - Check if the argument matches any of the defined defective argument types: Generalization (G), Incomplete Enumeration (FE), Inconclusive Reason (IR), Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB), Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR), Presumptuous Consensus (FU), or Ambiguous Language Use (DEP).

Now let's apply this decomposition to the given statement "You must obey the law, because it's illegal to break the law":

1. **Identify the Proposition (P):**
   - "You must obey the law."

2. **Identify the Reason (R):**
   - "Because it's illegal to break the law."

3. **Examine if the Reason conclusively supports the Proposition:**
   - The Reason simply restates the Proposition in other words without providing any new information or causal basis.

4. **Determine if there is any Proof of Reason (PR) and its nature:**
   - There isn't any additional argument provided that supports the Reason conclusively or in itself.

5. **Classify the detected fallacy:**
   - The statementâ€™s Reason (R) does nothing more than reiterate the Proposition (P) without additional support or logical underpinning. This matches the pattern of the defective argument type Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR).

Hence, applying IDAA to "You must obey the law, because it's illegal to break the law," we conclude that the logical fallacy used in the statement above is **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**.
