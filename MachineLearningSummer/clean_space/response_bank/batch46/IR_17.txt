Let's apply the process defined by <IDAA> to classify the given string "You moved the goalposts or made up an exception when your claim was shown to be false." Here's the step-by-step decomposition:

### Step 1: Understand the Task <IDA>
The task <IDA> involves classifying the given string as one of the defective argument types: <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP> as defined earlier.

### Step 2: Analyze the String <s>
The string to be analyzed is: 
"You moved the goalposts or made up an exception when your claim was shown to be false."

### Step 3: Identify Key Components and Definitions
From the definitions provided:
- **Generalization (G)**: Applies to a statement that generalizes based on an insufficient sample.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: Presents a limited set of possibilities omitting others.
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: Provides reasons that don't conclusively support the proposition.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: Gives weak causal reasons.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: Repeats the proposition in the argument.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: Assumes something is true because everyone agrees.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: Uses language that can be interpreted differently than intended.

### Step 4: Compare the String to Definitions
The string "You moved the goalposts or made up an exception when your claim was shown to be false" refers to a situation where criteria or rules are changed to avoid the truth of a previously made claim when it has been shown to be false. This involves a response tactic where exceptions are created or requirements are shifted to maintain a standpoint.

### Step 5: Identify the Relevant Defective Argument Type
This situation closely matches what's known as "moving the goalposts," which fits under the category of creating exceptions or altering criteria to keep a claim viable once it has been challenged successfully.

### Step 6: Match with Defined Categories
Let's see which predefined categories closest match this scenario:
- It doesn't fit **Generalization (G)**, **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**, or **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)** because those involve overgeneralizing, limited options, and repeating the original claim respectively.
- It doesn't fit with **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)** or **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)** as those involve weak causality and ambiguous language either.
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** talks about reasons not conclusively supporting the claim, but here it's more about shifting standards and creating exceptions.

### Step 7: Conclusion
While there's no direct match, the given faulty argument technique is most closely related to **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**, where the argument doesn't meet the standards initially set but attempts to validate itself by shifting those standards. However, none of the given categories perfectly describe "moving the goalposts." This specific fallacy is known better in logic as its own distinct fallacy rather than fitting neatly into one of the categories provided.

Thus, while the specific fallacy of "moving the goalposts" is closest aligned with creating an inconclusive argument, it doesn't precisely fit the predefined categories of **IR** in the provided definitions.
