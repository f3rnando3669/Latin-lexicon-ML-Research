For 
Applying **IDAA** (Decomposition of task <IDA> to classify a string) to the string **"It is either you are for the US war on terror or against it."**, we will follow these steps sequentially:

1. **Identify and understand the string**:
   - The string is: *"It is either you are for the US war on terror or against it."*
   - This statement is presenting a dichotomy, suggesting that there are only two possible positions.

2. **Evaluate the nature of the proposition (<P>)**:
   - The proposition (<P>) is asserting that there are only two possibilities regarding the stance on the US war on terror.
   - This sets a complete enumeration of possibilities about one's stance on the US war on terror.

3. **Analyze the Reason (<R>) provided**:
   - The Reason (<R>) implied is that the stance must be strictly for or against with no middle ground.

4. **Classify the type of defective argument**:
   - **Generalization (<G>)**: This does not apply as it's not about generalizing from specific cases.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: This proposition claims there are only two options without acknowledging other possible stances such as neutrality, complexity of opinion, or conditional support/opposition.
   - **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: This does not apply as the flaw is not about the inconclusiveness of the reason to the proposition.
   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: This does not apply as itâ€™s not about the weakness of the causal basis.
   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: This is not relevant since it does not repeat the proposition.
   - **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: This does not apply because there is no assumption of universal agreement.
   - **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**: This is not about ambiguous language but rather about binary choice.

5. **Determine the specific defective argument**:
   - The string most closely aligns with **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**, as it limits the options to only two which is an incomplete understanding of the range of possible stances on the issue.

**Conclusion**:
- Applying **IDAA**, the string **"It is either you are for the US war on terror or against it."** is classified as defective argument type **<FE> (Incomplete Enumeration)**.
