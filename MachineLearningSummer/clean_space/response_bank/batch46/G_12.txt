For 
To apply <IDAA> to the string "It’s getting late, and we still have to decide on the school budget. What do you say we just leave it as is and we can call it a night?", we will follow the decomposition methodology (<D>) step by step to classify the string into one of the defective argument types (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>).

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (<P>)
In this string, the proposition seems to be a suggestion based on the context of needing to decide on the school budget. The proposition can be summarized as:
**P:** We should just leave the school budget as it is.

### Step 2: Identify the Reason (<R>)
The reason given to support this proposition appears to be:
**R:** It’s getting late, and we can call it a night if we leave the budget as is.

### Step 3: Evaluate the Type of Reasoning
Next, we need to categorize the type of reasoning provided by evaluating if it fits any of the defective argument categories.

#### Evaluate for Generalization (<G>)
This doesn't fit <G> since it’s not making a sweeping generalization about a group or situation.

#### Evaluate for Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)
This doesn't fit <FE> because it isn't falsely claiming to consider all possibilities.

#### Evaluate for Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)
This could be a potential match, because the reason given (it's late) doesn’t logically or conclusively support the correctness of leaving the budget unchanged. It is bypassing the need for a thorough discussion by using the time of day as an excuse.

#### Evaluate for Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)
There is a weak causal basis for the reason provided; simply stating that it’s late doesn’t substantiate the decision about the school budget in a meaningful way.

#### Evaluate for Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)
This doesn’t fit <RR> since there's no repetition of the proposition presented as the reason.

#### Evaluate for Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)
This doesn't fit <FU> since it doesn’t rely on assumed consensus or popularity to support the proposition.

#### Evaluate for Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)
This doesn’t fit <DEP> because the language used is clear and unambiguous.

### Step 4: Final Classification
After the evaluation, we find that the reasoning is most accurately classified as "Inconclusive Reason" (<IR>) since the reason (it’s getting late) doesn’t convincingly demonstrate the correctness of the proposition (leaving the school budget unchanged).

### Final Output
The string "It’s getting late, and we still have to decide on the school budget. What do you say we just leave it as is and we can call it a night?" is classified as:
**<IR>** - Inconclusive Reason.

This completes the application of <IDAA> to the given string.
