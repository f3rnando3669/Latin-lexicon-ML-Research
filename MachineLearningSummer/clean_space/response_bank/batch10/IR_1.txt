For 
To identify the type of defective argument in the given string "My best friend says you’re a liar, so I’m not going to talk to you.", we apply the structured steps of the task decomposition for identifying defective arguments (IDAA).

**Input**: "My best friend says you’re a liar, so I’m not going to talk to you."

**Application Process**:

### Step 1: Analysis of Argument Structure

- **Main Proposition**: "I’m not going to talk to you."
- **Supporting Reasoning**: "My best friend says you’re a liar."

### Step 2: Comparison Against Known Defective Types

1. **Generalization (G)**:
   - This argument does not generalize a specific instance to a broader population.
2. **False Enumeration (FE)**:
   - This argument does not list options, so false enumeration is not applicable.
3. **Inappropriate Reason (IR)**:
   - The reason given ("My best friend says you’re a liar") does not logically support the conclusion ("I’m not going to talk to you").
4. **Redundant Reason (RR)**:
   - The argument does not restate the proposition in different words.
5. **Weak Causal Basis (WCB)**:
   - The argument does not provide a weak causal relationship to support the proposition. It simply provides an unrelated reason.
6. **False Universals (FU)**:
   - The argument does not assert universally agreed points without proof.
7. **Double-Edged Phrases (DEP)**:
   - The argument does not use statements open to dual interpretations.

### Step 3: Contextual Examination

- There are no dual interpretations or broader context issues provided in the argument that could influence the categorization.

### Step 4: Categorization

- Based on the comparison, the argument "My best friend says you’re a liar, so I’m not going to talk to you." matches the characteristics of **Inappropriate Reason (IR)**, as the reasoning given does not logically support the decision not to talk.

**Output**: The identified defective argument type is **Inappropriate Reason (IR)**.
