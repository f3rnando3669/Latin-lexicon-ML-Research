For 
To apply the <IDAA> process to the argument "It is immoral to kill an innocent human being.  Fetuses are innocent human beings.  Therefore, it is immoral to kill fetuses.", we will follow the decomposed steps of <D>:

### Application of Decomposed Steps to IDA (<IDAA>)

**Step 1: Comprehension**
- **Main Proposition**: "It is immoral to kill fetuses."
- **Supporting Reasons**:
   - "It is immoral to kill an innocent human being."
   - "Fetuses are innocent human beings."

**Step 2: Classification**
- The reasoning appears to be syllogistic and deductive, presenting premises to draw a conclusion.

**Step 3: Matching with Definitions**
- **Generalization (<G>)**: This argument is not generalizing based on a specific instance but rather using a logical structure.
- **False Enumeration (<FE>)**: The argument does not list options.
- **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>)**: The reasons provided ("It is immoral to kill an innocent human being" and "Fetuses are innocent human beings") appear to be directly connected to the conclusion.
- **Redundant Reason (<RR>)**: The reasons provided are not repetitive restatements of the conclusion.
- **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The argument does not provide a weak causal connection but rather a logical one.
- **False Universals (<FU>)**: The argument does not assert universally agreed points without proof.
- **Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>)**: There is no ambiguous statement open to dual interpretations here.

**Step 4: Identification**
- None of the defective argument types directly fit the structure of this argument. The argument seems to follow a logical form of reasoning by presenting a structured syllogism:
  1. Major Premise: "It is immoral to kill an innocent human being."
  2. Minor Premise: "Fetuses are innocent human beings."
  3. Conclusion: "Therefore, it is immoral to kill fetuses."

Since the argument follows a classical logical structure and isn't inherently defective in the way defined (G, FE, IR, RR, WCB, FU, DEP), it does not clearly fall into one of the defective argument categories provided.

**Step 5: Validation**
- Without fitting into one of the specified defective argument types, the conclusion would be that the argument is not an example of the defective arguments listed.

### Conclusion
The argument "It is immoral to kill an innocent human being. Fetuses are innocent human beings. Therefore, it is immoral to kill fetuses." does not categorize well into any of the defined defective argument types (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>). It rather follows a traditional logical deductive structure, which is not inherently fallacious as per the definitions provided.
