For 
To apply <IDAA> to the dialogue provided, we'll decompose the task of identifying the defective argument type following the specified steps.

### Given String:
"Speaker 1: Jesus was not really crucified.
Speaker 2: How do I know that’s true?
Speaker 1: Because the Quran says so.
Speaker 2: How do I know the Quran is correct?
Speaker 1: Because the Quran is the Word of God, and everything it says is true.
Speaker 2: How do I know that’s true?
Speaker 1: Because God tells us so, here in the Quran."

### Decomposition of Identifying Defective Arguments (<IDAA>)
1. **Step 1: Understand the Statement**
   - **Description**: Read the exchange to understand the interaction and argument sequence.
   - **Example**: The speakers are discussing the truth of the statement "Jesus was not really crucified," with each response relying on the Quran's authority.

2. **Step 2: Identify Key Characteristics**
   - **Description**: Note keywords and the nature of the reasoning used.
   - **Example**: Phrases like "Because the Quran says so," "Because the Quran is the Word of God," suggest reliance on a single source of authority repeatedly.

3. **Step 3: Compare with Definitions**
   - **Description**: Compare the identified characteristics against the definitions of defective argument types (G, FE, IR, RR, WCB, FU, DEP).
   - **Example**: This argument mainly relies on circular reasoning where the proposition is justified by the same proposition in different forms.

4. **Step 4: Match with Defective Argument Type**
   - **Description**: Determine which defective argument type fits.
   - **Example**: The reasoning repeats the proposition that the Quran is true because it says so, fitting the pattern of <RR> (Redundant Reason).

5. **Step 5: Validate the Match**
   - **Description**: Re-check to ensure this is the most suitable match. Consider any alternate interpretations.
   - **Example**: Repeatedly using the Quran's authority without external validation confines this argument within <RR> since it is essentially restating the same reason.

### Analysis
- The dialogue relies on repeated references to the Quran to validate itself ("Because the Quran is the Word of God, and everything it says is true"), which matches the <RR> (Redundant Reason) definition since it is restating the premise in slightly different forms without providing external justification or evidence.

### Conclusion
Applying <IDAA> confirms that the type of defective argument in the given dialogue is <RR> (Redundant Reason), as the reasoning provided restates the proposition using a circular logic without external support.
