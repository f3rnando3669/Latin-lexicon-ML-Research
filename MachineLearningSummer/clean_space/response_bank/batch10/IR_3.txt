To identify the defective argument type present in the given passage using the steps defined in <IDAA>, we proceed as follows:

### Step 1: Read and Understand the Argument (<s>):
The argument described discusses the fallacy commonly referred to as "moving the goalposts," particularly in the context of arguments for the existence of God and how they shift as scientific understanding advances.

### Step 2: Identify Key Components of the Argument:
- **Main Claim:** Arguments for the existence of God are frequently revised in response to scientific advancements, a tactic often referred to as "moving the goalposts."
- **Supporting Premises:** Examples include shifts from creationism to intelligent design, and reliance on unresolved scientific questions, such as the origin of life, to argue for God's existence.

### Step 3: Classify the Components:
We need to determine which of the defective argument types fits this description:
- **Generalization (<G>):** The argument is not making a general truth claim based on a specific instance.
- **False Enumeration (<FE>):** It does not list fewer or more options than actually exist.
- **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>):** This does not seem to provide a reason that is irrelevant to the discussion.
- **Redundant Reason (<RR>):** The argument is not merely restating the same thing in different words.
- **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>):** It's not making a weak causal link but discussing the nature of shifting arguments.
- **False Universals (<FU>):** It seems closest to this category as it discusses how proponents of a view keep shifting their arguments to remain valid, which can come across as assuming universally agreed upon moves without proof.
- **Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>):** The argument is not using statements open to dual interpretations.

### Step 4: Assign the Correct Defective Argument Type:
The inappropriate shifting of arguments ("moving the goalposts") as described fits closely with the notion of **False Universals (<FU>)**. Here are the reasons for this classification:
- The argument suggests a recurring shift in justifications as scientific explanations evolve.
- It implies a universal behavior (i.e., proponents of creationism and intelligent design continually changing their arguments to align with the latest scientific gaps).

### Step 5: Review and Confirm:
- **Verification:** The passage concludes that the strategy of changing arguments is an unfair tactic (moving the goalposts), which aligns closely with the idea of False Universals where universally agreed upon changes are asserted without concrete evidence.
- **Potential Exception:** The passage notes a possible exception whereby the fallacy might be confused with arguments having multiple propositions.

### Conclusion:
The defective argument type present in the described passage is **False Universals (<FU>)** as it outlines an argument structure that unjustifiably shifts to evade definitive scientific refutation, implying broad but unwarranted acceptability of this tactic.
