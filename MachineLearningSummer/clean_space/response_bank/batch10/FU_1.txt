For 
Let's apply the structured approach of <IDAA> to the string "Get Verizon--1 billion people can't be wrong."

### Step-by-Step Decomposition:

1. **Identify the Proposition:** 
   The main claim is that one should get Verizon.

2. **Extract the Reasoning:** 
   The reasoning provided is that 1 billion people can't be wrong in their choice, implying a large number of people use Verizon.

3. **Compare With Definitions:**
   - **Generalization (<G>):** This doesn't seem to fit as it's not claiming a general truth based on a specific instance.
   - **False Enumeration (<FE>):** This doesn't artificially limit or exaggerate the number of options.
   - **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>):** This point is about providing a reason that doesnâ€™t logically support the proposition. While this could be loosely applicable because the number of users doesn't inherently validate the quality of the service, it seems to be relying on the concept of popularity much more directly.
   - **Redundant Reason (<RR>):** This doesn't restate the proposition in different words.
   - **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>):** This isn't focusing on a weak cause-and-effect relationship.
   - **False Universals (<FU>):** This fits the definition of <FU> as it appeals to the popularity and implies that the massive number of users is a universally accepted validation for choosing Verizon.
   - **Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>):** This argument doesn't have an interpretation that could potentially backfire against the speaker.

4. **Assign Defective Argument Type:** 
   Based on the evaluation, the string "Get Verizon--1 billion people can't be wrong." is identified as a False Universals (<FU>) type of defective argument because it asserts that the popularity of Verizon among 1 billion people should be a reason for others to choose it without providing evidence beyond the number of users.

### Conclusion:
The string "Get Verizon--1 billion people can't be wrong." is categorized as <FU> (False Universals) due to its reliance on the popularity appeal to validate the proposition.
