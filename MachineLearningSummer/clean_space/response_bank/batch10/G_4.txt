To apply the decomposition approach (<D>) to identify the defective argument type (<IDA>) in the given string, let's follow the step-by-step method rigorously.

### String (<s>):
"Three kids in one class failed the Jane Eyre quiz, I guess all the other classes will fail it, too."

### Steps for Decomposing the Task into Specific Steps (<D>):

1. **Initial Classification**:
    - **Sweeping Generalization**:
        - Does the argument make a generalization based on a specific instance? Yes, it makes a broad claim about all classes based on the failure of three kids in one class.
    - **Limiting Options in Enumeration**:
        - Does it limit the possibilities? Not applicable in this context.
    - **Logical Support of Proposition**:
        - Does the reason logically support the proposition? The reasoning does not adequately support the broad claim.
    - **Repetition of Proposition**:
        - Does it merely repeat the proposition in other words? No, it does not repeat but extends the claim beyond the initial instance.
    - **Effectiveness in Supporting Proposition**:
        - Is the reason strong enough to support the proposition? No, basing the failure rate of all classes on just one instance is not compelling.
    - **Universal Claim without Proof**:
        - Is there an assertion made without proof that applies universally? Yes, it generalizes the failure rate of all classes without additional evidence.
    - **Ambiguous Statements**:
        - Are there any ambiguous statements open to dual interpretations? No ambiguous statements present.

2. **Further Refinement**:
    - Since the argument makes a sweeping generalization based on insufficient evidence, we need to apply criteria to validate it falls under Generalization:
        - **Broad Claim Based on Insufficient Evidence**: The argument generalizes the likelihood of failure in all classes from the specific failure of three kids in one class, which is insufficient and not representative of all classes.

### Conclusion:
**Identified Argument Type**: <G> (Generalization)

By breaking down the task (applying <D>), we ascertain that the defective argument type in the given string is an example of Generalization (<G>).
