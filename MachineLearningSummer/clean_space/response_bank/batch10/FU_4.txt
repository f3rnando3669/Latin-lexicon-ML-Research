For 
Let's apply the decomposition process <D> to the task of identifying the defective argument <IDA> for the string **"Everyone else is doing it, so should you."** Here is the step-by-step approach:

### Step-by-Step Application of IDAA:

1. **Step 1:** **Read and understand the string <s> to grasp the argument being made.**
   - The argument in the string is suggesting that one should do something because everyone else is doing it.

2. **Step 2:** **Identify key phrases or claims that might indicate a defective argument.**
   - The key phrase here is "Everyone else is doing it."

3. **Step 3:** **Compare these key phrases or claims against the defined categories of defective argument types (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>).**
   - **Generalization (<G>):** Not applicable as it’s not deriving a general truth from a specific instance.
   - **False Enumeration (<FE>):** Not applicable as it doesn’t involve listing fewer or more options.
   - **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>):** The reason provided (everyone else is doing it) is not unrelated but might be weak.
   - **Redundant Reason (<RR>):** Not a rephrased proposition.
   - **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>):** The causality is not necessarily weak but framed as universally accepted.
   - **False Universals (<FU>):** Yes, it asserts a universally agreed point ("everyone else is doing it") without proof.
   - **Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>):** Not applicable as it doesn’t have dual interpretations.

4. **Step 4:** **Match the argument in <s> to the most fitting defective argument type based on definitions and examples provided.**
   - Among the defective argument types, **False Universals (<FU>)** fits well. It indicates that the argument relies on the assumption that something should be done because "everyone else" is doing it, which is a universal assertion without supporting proof.

5. **Step 5:** **Conclusively categorize <s> under the identified defective argument type.**
   - The string **"Everyone else is doing it, so should you."** has the defective argument type: **False Universals (<FU>)**.

### Conclusion:
By following the decomposed steps, we identify that the defective argument type for the string **"Everyone else is doing it, so should you."** is **False Universals (<FU>)**.
