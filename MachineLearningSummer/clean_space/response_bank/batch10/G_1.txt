For 
To apply <IDAA> to the given string "I heard that the Catholic Church was involved in a sex scandal cover-up. Therefore, my 102-year-old Catholic neighbor, who frequently attends Church, is guilty as well!", we'll follow the systematic steps defined:

1. **Read and Comprehend:** Understand that the speaker is suggesting that because the Catholic Church as an institution was involved in a scandal, a specific individual Catholic (their neighbor) is also guilty.

2. **Compare Elements to Argument Types:**
   - **<G> Generalization:** The statement makes a broad, sweeping claim based on a specific instance (the scandal within the Catholic Church leading to an accusation against the neighbor).
   - **<FE> False Enumeration:** Does not list multiple options.
   - **<IR> Inappropriate Reason:** The guilt of the entire church does not logically imply the guilt of an individual member.
   - **<RR> Redundant Reason:** Not simply rephrasing the proposition.
   - **<WCB> Weak Causal Basis:** The causal link between the church scandal and the individual's guilt is extremely weak.
   - **<FU> False Universals:** It does not assert a universally agreed point without proof, rather it makes an unfounded general assumption about one individual.
   - **<DEP> Double-Edged Phrases:** Not using statements open to dual interpretations.

3. **Determine the Best Match:**
   - The string primarily asserts a general claim based on a specific instance, indicating **<G> Generalization**.
   - It also provides a reason that doesn't logically support the proposition (i.e., involvement in the church scandal doesn't imply individual guilt), indicating **<IR> Inappropriate Reason**.
   - There is an element of weak causal basis as the connection between the church's actions and the individual's guilt is tenuous, but this is secondary.

**Conclusion:**
The defective argument type for the given string is primarily **<G> Generalization** and secondarily **<IR> Inappropriate Reason**.
