For 
Let's apply the decomposition of the advanced task to the string provided, "We need to fix our broken judicial system by electing new people." to identify the type of defective argument:

### Step 1: Understand the Argument

**Argument:** "We need to fix our broken judicial system by electing new people."
- **Main Claim:** We need to fix our broken judicial system.
- **Reasoning:** This can be done by electing new people.

### Step 2: Identify the Components
- **Main Claim:** Fixing the broken judicial system.
- **Provided Solution/Reasioning:** Electing new people as a solution.

### Step 3: Compare with Defective Argument Types

- **Generalization (\<G\>)**: This doesn't seem to generalize a specific instance to a universal truth.
- **False Enumeration (\<FE\>)**: The argument is suggesting a single option (electing new people) without discussing whether there are other methods available to fix the system.
- **Inappropriate Reason (\<IR\>)**: The reason given (electing new people) may not logically lead to the desired result (fixing the judicial system).
- **Redundant Reason (\<RR\>)**: The reasoning isn't merely restating the claim in different words.
- **Weak Causal Basis (\<WCB\>)**: The argument potentially offers a weak reason that electing new people would lead to fixing the judicial system.
- **False Universals (\<FU\>)**: This is not about asserting a universal point without evidence.
- **Double-Edged Phrases (\<DEP\>)**: There's no dual interpretation likely to work against the speaker.

### Step 4: Map to the Closest Defective Argument

The reasoning provided (electing new people) is supposed to fix the broken judicial system, but it may not be compelling enough (i.e., it assumes electing new people will solve complex systematic issues).

Thus, **Weak Causal Basis (\<WCB\>)** seems to be the closest defective argument type, suggesting the reason provided may not be strong enough to support the claim.

### Step 5: Verify the Match

Indeed, the suggestion that simply electing new people will fix a broken judicial system might be an oversimplified solution, lacking a compelling causal relationship or sufficient evidence that this approach would work.

### Step 6: Conclude

The logical fallacy present in the argument "We need to fix our broken judicial system by electing new people." is an example of:

**Weak Causal Basis (\<WCB\>)**

The argument offers a reason (electing new people) that might not be compelling enough to logically support the proposition (fixing the judicial system).
