For 
To apply \( <IDAA> \) to the statement "I drank bottled water and now I am sick, so the water must have made me sick," we will decompose the task of identifying the type of defective argument into specific steps as defined.

**Application of \( <IDAA> \):**

1. **Analyze the Argument:**
   - Proposition: "The water must have made me sick."
   - Supporting Statement: "I drank bottled water and now I am sick."

2. **Classify the Defect:**
   - Determine that the argument involves an inferred causal relationship.

3. **Evaluate Each Category:**
   - **Generalization (<G>):** Not applicable here as it does not make a broad claim based on a specific instance.
   - **False Enumeration (<FE>):** Not applicable, as no enumeration of options is listed.
   - **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>):** The reason appears related to the proposition and does not seem irrelevant.
   - **Redundant Reason (<RR>):** The reason does not simply restate the proposition.
   - **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>):** The argument presents a weak causal connection between drinking bottled water and getting sick without sufficient evidence to support the claim.
   - **False Universals (<FU>):** Not applicable, as no universal points without proof are asserted.
   - **Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>):** Not applicable, no dual interpretations present.

4. **Match the Argument:**
   - The defective argument type for this string is \( <WCB> \).

So, upon applying \( <IDAA> \), the identified type of defective argument for the given statement is \( <WCB> \) (Weak Causal Basis).
