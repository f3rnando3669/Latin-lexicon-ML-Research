For 
Applying **<IDAA>** to the argument "Encourages the audience to become part of a group or act because other people are acting in the same way," we will use the steps of decomposition to identify the type of defective argument it represents.

### Decomposition Steps for <IDA>:

1. **Step 1 - Comprehension:**
   - Understand the core message of the argument.
   - This argument suggests that the audience should join a group or perform an action based on the fact that other people are doing the same.

2. **Step 2 - Identification of Claims:**
   - The main claim is that one should take an action or join a group because others are doing so.
   - The supporting reason provided is the behavior of other people acting in the same way.

3. **Step 3 - Match Pattern:**
   - Compare the argument to the known patterns of defective argument types.
   - This argument appears to rely on the idea that if everyone is doing something, it must be the right thing to do.

4. **Step 4 - Classification:**
   - This matches the pattern of a **<FU> (False Universals)**:
     - It is asserting a universally agreed point (everyone else is doing it) without providing actual proof or logical reasoning.
     - Appeals to popularity or the fact that many people are doing something as an attempted form of validation.

### Classification of the Argument:

The argument "Encourages the audience to become part of a group or act because other people are acting in the same way" is classified as **<FU> (False Universals)**. This is because it uses the behavior of the majority as a justification without providing a logical or substantial reason for why the audience should follow suit, thereby relying on an appeal to popularity.

By applying **<IDAA>**, we can systematically determine that the argument fits the pattern of False Universals, as it expects the correctness of an action based solely on its popularity or common acceptance.
