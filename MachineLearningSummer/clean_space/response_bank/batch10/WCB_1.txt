Sure, let's apply the decomposition steps (<D>) to identify the type of defective argument in the string "The reason Donald Trump got elected was because liberals took political correctness too far."

1. **Step 1: Comprehend the Statement:**
   - Understand the statement: The statement claims that Donald Trump was elected because liberals exaggerated political correctness.

2. **Step 2: Identify the Key Elements:**
   - Key elements: 
     - The election of Donald Trump.
     - The reason provided: liberals took political correctness too far.

3. **Step 3: Compare Against Known Defective Arguments:**
   - Compare these key elements to the characteristics of each defective argument type:
     - **<G>**: No generalization based on a specific instance.
     - **<FE>**: Not listing fewer or more options than exist.
     - **<IR>**: Possibility exists as the given reason might not logically support the proposition.
     - **<RR>**: Not saying the same thing as the proposition in other words.
     - **<WCB>**: Possibility exists as the reason might not provide enough compelling support.
     - **<FU>**: Not asserting a universally agreed point without proof.
     - **<DEP>**: Not using double-edged phrases.

4. **Step 4: Match the Pattern:**
   - There are two potential defective argument types to consider: 
     - **<IR> (Inappropriate Reason)**: The reason provided (liberals took political correctness too far) may not logically support the election outcome, as there likely are many factors contributing to Trump's election that this single reason does not entirely encompass.
     - **<WCB> (Weak Causal Basis)**: The reason offered is not compelling enough to alone explain the complex outcome of a presidential election, suggesting an oversimplified causal relationship.

5. **Step 5: Confirm and Explain:**
   - To confirm, we need to assess which fits better between <IR> and <WCB>. 
     - **<IR>** typically implies the reason is entirely inappropriate and doesn't follow logically.
     - **<WCB** implies a reason that's merely not strong or substantial enough.

Given that the reason provided (liberals took political correctness too far) might hold some relevance but is not sufficient to solely explain a multifaceted event like an election, it aligns more closely with <WCB> rather than being entirely inappropriate. The reason is weak (inadequate) rather than completely irrelevant.

### Conclusion:
Thus, "The reason Donald Trump got elected was because liberals took political correctness too far." is an example of <WCB> (Weak Causal Basis).

By following these steps, we effectively decomposed the task <IDA> into specific steps and applied it to identify the argument type in the given statement, demonstrating the application of <IDAA>.
