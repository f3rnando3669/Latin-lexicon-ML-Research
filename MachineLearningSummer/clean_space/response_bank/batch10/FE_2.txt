For 
To identify the type of defective argument in the string "You either support Hillary Clinton for President or you don't believe in women's rights," we will apply the decomposed steps (IDAA) for identifying defective arguments:

### Decomposition (D) for Identifying Defective Argument (IDA)

1. **Reading and Understanding <s>**:
    - String <s>: "You either support Hillary Clinton for President or you don't believe in women's rights."
    - Ensure full understanding of the context and the argument being made.

2. **Preliminary Classification**:
    - Tentatively note that this string seems to present a binary choice, possibly ignoring other valid options.

3. **Criteria Application**:
    - **For <G>**: Check if <s> claims a general truth based on a specific instance.
        - Not applicable; <s> does not claim a general truth based on a specific instance.
    - **For <FE>**: Check if <s> lists fewer or more options than actually exist.
        - Applicable; <s> suggests there are only two options (supporting Hillary Clinton or not believing in women's rights).
    - **For <IR>**: Check if the reason given does not logically support the proposition.
        - Not applicable; <s> does not seem to provide an unrelated reason.
    - **For <RR>**: Check if the reason given is a rephrasing of the proposition.
        - Not applicable; <s> does not rephrase the proposition.
    - **For <WCB>**: Check if the reason provided is not compelling enough to support the proposition.
        - Not applicable; this category does not fit the structure of <s>.
    - **For <FU>**: Check if <s> asserts universally agreed points without proof.
        - Not applicable; <s> does not assert universally accepted points without proof.
    - **For <DEP>**: Check if <s> uses statements open to dual interpretations that can work against the speaker.
        - Not applicable; <s> does not seem to employ double-edged phrases.

4. **Cross-Verification**:
    - Confirm that the primary defect in the argument is the false dichotomy. It forces a choice between two options while ignoring other valid alternatives, e.g., supporting other candidates who believe in women's rights.

5. **Documentation**:
    - Identified type: <FE> (False Enumeration)
    - Explanation: The argument is classified as <FE> because it falsely limits the options to either supporting Hillary Clinton or not believing in women's rights, ignoring other possible choices.

### Application of IDAA:

1. **Reading and Understanding <s>**:
    - String <s>: "You either support Hillary Clinton for President or you don't believe in women's rights."
    - Fully understood the context and the binary nature of the argument presented.

2. **Preliminary Classification**:
    - Note that the argument seems to present a false binary choice.

3. **Criteria Application**:
    - **For <FE>**: Confirmed that the argument lists fewer options than actually exist.

4. **Cross-Verification**:
    - Double-checked and confirmed that the primary defect is presenting a false dichotomy.

5. **Documentation**:
    - Identified type: <FE>
    - Explanation: The proposition is categorized as <FE> due to the false enumeration of options, suggesting there are only two choices when more actually exist.

In conclusion, the string "You either support Hillary Clinton for President or you don't believe in women's rights" exemplifies a False Enumeration (<FE>).
