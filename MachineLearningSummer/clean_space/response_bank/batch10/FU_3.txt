### Application of IDAA to the Argument

**Argument \( s \)**: "Officer, I was only driving as fast as everyone around me. I'm sure I wasn't speeding."

Let's break down the steps as outlined:

1. **Initial Reading**:
   - The statement is made to an officer, presumably in defense of the speaker's driving speed. The core claim is that the speaker was not speeding because they were driving at the same speed as others around them.

2. **Classification**:
   - Identify the type of reasoning or logical structure being used. In this case, it seems to involve a comparison to the actions of others.

3. **Matching**:
   - Compare this reasoning with the definitions of defective argument types provided:
     - Generalization (<G>)
     - False Enumeration (<FE>)
     - Inappropriate Reason (<IR>)
     - Redundant Reason (<RR>)
     - Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>)
     - False Universals (<FU>)
     - Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>)

4. **Verification**:
   - Examine the argument closely: The speaker is appealing to the idea that because everyone else was driving at a certain speed, it justifies their own speed.

5. **Assignment**:
   - The reasoning here is appealing to a general consensus ("everyone around me") to excuse individual behavior, which aligns well with the definition of False Universals (<FU>).

6. **Explanation**:
   - Explain why this matches <FU>: "The statement 'I was only driving as fast as everyone around me' uses the perceived actions of many others to justify an individual action, implying that conformity to the majority makes the behavior acceptable. This fits the pattern of False Universals, as it asserts that since many are doing it, it must be right."

Therefore, the argument "Officer, I was only driving as fast as everyone around me. I'm sure I wasn't speeding." can be identified as an example of False Universals (<FU>).
