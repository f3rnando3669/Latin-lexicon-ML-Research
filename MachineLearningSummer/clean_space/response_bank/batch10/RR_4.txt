For 
To identify the type of defective argument in the string "That restaurant is popular because everyone in town goes there," we will apply the <IDAA> (application of decomposition to achieve the task of identifying the argument type). Here's the step-by-step process:

### Step 1: Understand and Define Each Defective Argument Type

We have the following definitions:
- **<G> Generalization:** Claiming a general truth based on a specific instance.
- **<FE> False Enumeration:** Listing fewer or more options than actually exist.
- **<IR> Inappropriate Reason:** Providing a reason that doesn't logically support the proposition.
- **<RR> Redundant Reason:** Saying the same thing as the proposition but in other words.
- **<WCB> Weak Causal Basis:** Offering a reason that is not compelling enough to support the proposition.
- **<FU> False Universals:** Asserting universally agreed points without proof.
- **<DEP> Double-Edged Phrases:** Using statements open to dual interpretations, potentially against the speaker.

### Step 2: Examine and Parse the Argument

- **Proposition:** "That restaurant is popular."
- **Reason:** "Because everyone in town goes there."

### Step 3: Compare and Identify Patterns 

- The argument states that the reason for the restaurant's popularity is that everyone in town goes there.
- The reason provided is essentially a restatement of the proposition: the restaurant is popular (many people go there) because many people go there.
- This looks like **<RR> Redundant Reason** because it uses circular reasoning where the proposition and the reason are effectively the same.

### Step 4: Classify the Defective Argument

Based on the analysis, the pattern fits well with **<RR> Redundant Reason**.

### Conclusion

The string "That restaurant is popular because everyone in town goes there." can be identified as **<RR> Redundant Reason** using the <IDAA> approach.
