For 
Certainly! Let's apply the steps of <IDAA> to the given string:

### Given String

"**Speaker 1: We are using thousands of people, who are going door to door to help us spread the word about social injustice and the need for change.**  
**Speaker 2: Well then, I can’t be a part of this because I was always been taught that it’s wrong to use people.**"

### **<IDAA> Steps**

1. **Step 1: Clarify the Proposition**
   - **Speaker 1** Proposition: "We are using thousands of people to spread the word about social injustice and the need for change."
   - **Speaker 2** Proposition: "I can’t be a part of this because I was always taught that it’s wrong to use people."

2. **Step 2: Analyze Specificity**
   - **Speaker 1** appears to be making a general activity claim rather than pinpointing a specific instance.
   - **Speaker 2** is drawing on a specific teaching without any generalized claim.

3. **Step 3: Enumerate the Options**
   - Neither speaker is listing multiple options, so this doesn't pertain to <FE>.

4. **Step 4: Evaluate Logical Relevance**
   - **Speaker 2**’s reason ("I was always taught that it’s wrong to use people") doesn't logically relate to the context where "using" here means employing people's help voluntarily. This implies a possible <IR> (Inappropriate Reason).

5. **Step 5: Check for Redundancy**
   - There doesn’t appear to be redundancy as the phrases aren't restating each other.

6. **Step 6: Assess Causal Basis**
   - **Speaker 2** assumes that the act of “using people” here fits a negative context but doesn't show how it directly causes harm or is unkind in this instance. This can imply a weak causal basis.

7. **Step 7: Verify Universal Claims**
   - **Speaker 2**'s statement does assume a kind of universal moral stance ("wrong to use people") but is more likely interpreted in context.

8. **Step 8: Detect Dual Interpretations**
   - **Speaker 2**’s phrase "it’s wrong to use people" could be interpreted in two ways, leading to **Speaker 2** perceiving the term “using” negatively while **Speaker 1** intended it neutrally or positively in context of activism help.

### **Conclusion**
The strongest relevant defective argument types for the given string are:

- **Inappropriate Reason** (<IR>)
- **Double-Edged Phrases** (<DEP>)

**Final Analysis:**
"Speaker 2's response ('I can’t be a part of this because I was always been taught that it’s wrong to use people') exhibits characteristics of **<IR>** because the reason given doesn't logically support the conclusion in the context provided, and it also fit as **<DEP>** as the phrase 'use people' could be understood in two different ways."

Thus, the main identified defective argument types in this string are **Inappropriate Reason** (<IR>) and **Double-Edged Phrases** (<DEP>).
