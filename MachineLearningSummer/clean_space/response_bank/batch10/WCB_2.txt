For 
Let's apply the IDAA process to the given string: "Farmer McDonald: Ever since they put up that new power plant across the river, we haven't had a bit of rain. I'm tellin' you, mankind has got too big for its britches when it fiddles around with nature."

### Step-by-Step Breakdown (IDAA):

1. **Read the Argument:**
   - "Farmer McDonald: Ever since they put up that new power plant across the river, we haven't had a bit of rain. I'm tellin' you, mankind has got too big for its britches when it fiddles around with nature."

2. **Identify Keywords and Structure:**
   - Keywords: "Ever since," "haven't had a bit of rain," "power plant," "mankind," "fiddles with nature."
   - Structure: Farmer McDonald is attributing the lack of rain to the installation of the new power plant.

3. **Cross-reference with Definitions:**
   - **Generalization (G)** is not a fit as this isn't claiming a broad truth from a specific instance.
   - **False Enumeration (FE)** doesn't apply; no listing of options.
   - **Inappropriate Reason (IR)** might seem to fit since the reason provided (building a power plant) doesn't logically support the conclusion (lack of rain). Let's keep this in mind.
   - **Redundant Reason (RR)** isn't applicable since it is not repeating the same thing in other words.
   - **Weak Causal Basis (WCB)** might be suitable as the argument gives an insufficient reason to support the proposition that the new power plant caused the lack of rain.
   - **False Universals (FU)** is not a fit as there’s no universal claim being made without proof.
   - **Double-Edged Phrases (DEP)** doesn't apply since there's no dual interpretation here.

4. **Check Context and Logic:**
   - The logical connection between the building of a power plant and the lack of rain is very weak—there’s no substantive evidence to support this causal correlation. This indicates a weak causal basis.

5. **Select the Defective Argument Type:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most fitting defective argument type is **Weak Causal Basis (WCB)**.

6. **Verify:**
   - Reassessing the argument, it indeed fits under Weak Causal Basis as Farmer McDonald is attributing a lack of rain to the power plant without sufficient evidence to support this causal connection.

### Conclusion:
The defective argument type for the given string is **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>)**.
