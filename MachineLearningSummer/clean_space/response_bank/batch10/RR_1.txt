To identify the type of defective argument in the statement "Paranormal activity is real because I have experienced what can only be described as paranormal activity," we will follow the decomposition steps defined earlier. 

### Applying <IDAA>:

**1. Read and Understand the Statement**:
- The statement is: "Paranormal activity is real because I have experienced what can only be described as paranormal activity."

**2. Determine the Main Proposition**:
- The main proposition is: "Paranormal activity is real."

**3. Evaluate the Reasoning**:
- The reasoning provided is: "because I have experienced what can only be described as paranormal activity."

**4. Match Against Known Defective Argument Types**:
- The argument claims that paranormal activity is real simply because the speaker has experienced something they describe as paranormal.

**5. Identify Logical Fallacies**:
- This reasoning is circular. The statement is merely restating the proposition with slightly different wording but does not provide new or independent evidence. 

**6. Categorize the Argument**:
- This type of argument is a Redundant Reason (<RR>) because the reasoning is essentially the same as the proposition, just rephrased.

**7. Verify with Examples**:
- Comparing with our examples of Redundant Reason, such as "This legislation is sinful because it is the wrong thing to do." and "smoking cigarettes is deadly because cigarettes can kill you," we see that "Paranormal activity is real because I have experienced what can only be described as paranormal activity" fits this pattern of circular reasoning.
