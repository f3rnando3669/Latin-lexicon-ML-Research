### Application (IDAA):
We will now apply the decomposed steps \( D \) to identify the type of defective argument in the given string \( s = "I thought you were a good person, but you weren’t in class today." \).

**Step 1: Identify Keywords and Phrases**
- The keywords in this string are “good person” and “weren’t in class today.”
- The statement seems to link being a “good person” with attending class.

**Step 2: Categorize the Argument**
- Consider the definitions provided:
  - It does **not** seem to claim a general truth based on a specific instance, so it is likely **not** Generalization \( G \).
  - It does **not** list fewer or more options than actually exist, thus it is **not** False Enumeration \( FE \).
  - The reason provided for not being a good person (missing class) does **not** logically support the proposition in a meaningful way, hinting towards Inappropriate Reason \( IR \).
  - It does **not** redundantly state the same thing as the proposition, so it is **not** Redundant Reason \( RR \).
  - The reason does not provide compelling evidence to support the proposition, but it’s weak rather than irrelevant, leading towards Weak Causal Basis \( WCB \).
  - The statement does **not** assert universally agreed points without proof, which means it's likely **not** False Universals \( FU \).
  - Finally, the statement does **not** seem to use dual interpretation, so it is **not** Double-Edged Phrases \( DEP \).

Given the closest match, the statement seems to be providing an inappropriate reason for concluding that someone is not a good person just because they missed class. This aligns well with **Inappropriate Reason \( IR \)**.

**Step 3: Provide Justification**
- The argument claims that being absent from class means the person is not a good person, which is an inappropriate reason. The goodness of a person cannot logically be determined solely by their attendance in class. Hence, it is classified as **Inappropriate Reason \( IR \)**.

### Output
The defective argument type for \( s = "I thought you were a good person, but you weren’t in class today." \) is **Inappropriate Reason \( IR \)**.
