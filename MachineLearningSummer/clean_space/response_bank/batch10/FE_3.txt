### Application of \( \langle IDAA \rangle \) to "People either like coffee or hate it."

Let's break down the task of identifying the type of defective argument present in the given string using the systematic approach outlined.

**Example string (\( \langle s \rangle \))**: "People either like coffee or hate it."

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (\( \langle D \rangle \)) of \( \langle IDA \rangle \)

1. **Understand the Argument:**
   - Proposition: People's preferences towards coffee are binary; they either like it or hate it.

2. **Categorize the Argument:**
   - Needs classification under one of the specified defective argument types.

3. **Look for Key Indicators:**
   - Check if the argument limits the options to fewer than actually exist, indicating a potential False Enumeration (\( \langle FE \rangle \)).

4. **Analyze Context and Content:**
   - Context: A statement about people's preferences towards coffee.
   - Content: The statement simplifies the range of preferences to only two extreme options, ignoring possible intermediate or neutral opinions.

5. **Match Argument to Type:**
   - The argument fits the characteristics of False Enumeration (\( \langle FE \rangle \)), as it lists only two options (like or hate) when more possibilities (such as indifference or ambivalence) exist.

6. **Validate the Classification:**
   - The argument conforms with the definition of False Enumeration (\( \langle FE \rangle \)), as it incorrectly limits the choices to a binary opposition.

**Conclusion:**
The example string "People either like coffee or hate it." is an instance of the defective argument type \( \langle FE \rangle \) (False Enumeration).

By applying the detailed steps of \( \langle IDAA \rangle \), we have systematically identified that the given string exemplifies False Enumeration.
