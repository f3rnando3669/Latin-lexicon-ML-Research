### Steps to Decompose <IDA> (Identifying Defective Argument):

**Step 1**: **Understand and Parse the Argument**
- Read the argument thoroughly.
- Identify the main proposition or claim.

**Step 2**: **Classify the Type of Defective Argument**
- **Generalization?**: Check if the argument is making a broad claim based on a specific instance.
- **False Enumeration?**: Check if the argument is listing options but omitting some possibilities or inventing false choices.
- **Inappropriate Reason?**: Check if the argument's reason doesn't logically support the proposition.
- **Redundant Reason?**: Check if the reason merely restates the proposition in different words.
- **Weak Causal Basis?**: Check if the cause provided is weak or unconvincing.
- **False Universals?**: Check if the argument is claiming universally agreed points without proof.
- **Double-Edged Phrases?**: Check if the statements are open to dual interpretations.

### Application of Decomposition to <IDA> (IDAA):

**Example Argument**: "When the judge asked the defendant why he hadn't paid his parking fines, he said that he shouldn't have to pay them because the sign said 'Fine for parking here' and so he naturally presumed that it would be fine to park there."

**Step 1**: **Understand and Parse the Argument**
- **Proposition**: The defendant should not have to pay the parking fines.
- **Reason**: The sign said 'Fine for parking here,' and the defendant presumed it meant it was acceptable to park there.

**Step 2**: **Classify the Type of Defective Argument**
- **Generalization?**: No, it doesn't make a broad claim based on a specific instance.
- **False Enumeration?**: No, it does not list limited or fake options as choices.
- **Inappropriate Reason?**: No, the reason does connect to the proposition, though incorrectly.
- **Redundant Reason?**: No, the reason is not just a restatement of the proposition in different words.
- **Weak Causal Basis?**: No, it's not a case of weak causality.
- **False Universals?**: No, it doesn't depend on universally agreed points without proof.
- **Double-Edged Phrases**: Yes, the phrase "Fine for parking here" can be interpreted in two ways: a) It is acceptable to park here. b) There will be a fine for parking here. The defendant's incorrect interpretation is due to the dual nature of the phrase.

### Result:
The defective argument type is **<DEP> (Double-Edged Phrases)**.

The argument uses a statement that can be interpreted in two ways, which has led to a misunderstanding or a misinterpretation by the defendant.
