For 
To classify the given string according to one of the defective argument types, we'll use the step-by-step approach (IDAA).

### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Identify the Argument's Structure:
The argument in the string discusses the nature of arguments for the existence of God and how they have shifted over time with scientific advancements. Specifically, it makes a claim about how arguments that involve questions unanswered by science are abandoned for new ones when science provides answers.

#### 2. Compare Against Definitions:
Compare the structure and content of the argument against the definitions for each defective argument type, looking for an initial match.

#### 3. Check for Specific Characteristics:
- **Generalization (<G>):**
  - This argument doesn't appear to claim a general truth based on a single instance. It discusses a pattern over time.
  
- **False Enumeration (<FE>):**
  - The argument does not list limited options or falsely presents limited scenarios.

- **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>):**
  - The reason presented (science explaining previously unanswered questions leading to shifts in arguments) logically supports the proposition.

- **Redundant Reason (<RR>):**
  - The argument does not rephrase the proposition using different words.

- **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>):**
  - The causal link (science explanations leading to changes in arguments for the existence of God) doesn’t appear weak or insufficient. It’s a reasonable causal connection.

- **False Universals (<FU>):**
  - There's a notable characteristic here: the argument about the trend of shifting arguments for God's existence uses a universally perceived pattern, e.g., "arguments that used to be used for God...replaced with new ones...". The pattern is ubiquitous but not backed by specific proof that it occurs universally.

- **Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>):**
  - There do not appear to be any statements open to dual interpretations that are used against the speaker.

#### 4. Eliminate Non-Appliances:
Through the above comparison:
- Exclude <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, and <DEP>.

#### 5. Determine Best Fit:
Given that the argument uses a trend observed over time without concrete proof of this trend being universally acknowledged, it fits the characteristics of **False Universals (FU)**. The argument relies on a pattern seen by many but without presenting solid evidence that this pattern indeed happens universally.

### Conclusion
The best classification for the provided string is **False Universals (FU)**.
