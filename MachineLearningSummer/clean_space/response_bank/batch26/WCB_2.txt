For 
To apply <IDAA> to the string "Farmer McDonald: Ever since they put up that new power plant across the river, we haven't had a bit of rain. I'm tellin' you, mankind has got too big for its britches when it fiddles around with nature.", we will follow the step-by-step process:

1. **Identify the Core Proposition:**
   The core proposition appears to be "Mankind has got too big for its britches when it fiddles around with nature."

2. **Examine the Reasoning Provided:**
   The reasoning is that since the power plant was built, there hasn't been any rain, implying a causal relationship between the two.

3. **Cross-check with Definitions and Examples:**
   We compare this reasoning with our list of defective argument types.

4. **Evaluate for Generalization (<G>):**
   The argument does not claim a general truth based on a specific instance directly, but rather it uses a specific observation (no rain since power plant) to support a broader claim (mankind fiddling with nature).

5. **Evaluate for False Enumeration (<FE>):**
   This argument does not list fewer or more options than actually exist; hence, it does not fit <FE>.

6. **Evaluate for Inappropriate Reason (<IR>):**
   The reason given (no rain because of the power plant) does not logically support the broader proposition (mankind fiddling with nature), suggesting a possible misalignment between the evidence and the claim.

7. **Evaluate for Redundant Reason (<RR>):**
   The reasoning is not simply a rephrasing of the initial proposition using different words.

8. **Evaluate for Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>):**
   The causal basis (the power plant causing lack of rain) is weak because there is no compelling evidence provided to substantiate this causal effect. The link between the power plant and no rain is tenuous and lacks scientific or logical support.

9. **Evaluate for False Universals (<FU>):**
   It does not assert universally agreed points without proof but rather focuses on a specific situation.

10. **Evaluate for Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>):**
   The statement does not seem to be open to dual interpretations that could undermine the argument.

11. **Conclude and Classify:**
   Based on our evaluations, the statement that the power plant caused no rain and thus mankind is fiddling with nature fits best as <WCB> (Weak Causal Basis). The causal link between the two events is unsubstantiated and not compelling.

Therefore, the string should be classified as <WCB>.
