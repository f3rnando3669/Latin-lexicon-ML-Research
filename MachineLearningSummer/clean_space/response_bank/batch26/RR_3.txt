For 
Applying \(<IDAA>\) to classify the string "Speaker 1: Jesus was not really crucified. Speaker 2: How do I know that’s true? Speaker 1: Because the Quran says so. Speaker 2: How do I know the Quran is correct? Speaker 1: Because the Quran is the Word of God, and everything it says is true. Speaker 2: How do I know that’s true? Speaker 1: Because God tells us so, here in the Koran."

### Step 1: Understand the Definition of Each Argument Type

- **\(<G>\)**: Generalization: Claims general truth based on specific instance.
- **\(<FE>\)**: False Enumeration: Lists fewer or more options than exist.
- **\(<IR>\)**: Inappropriate Reason: Provides a reason that doesn't logically support the proposition.
- **\(<RR>\)**: Redundant Reason: Presents a new reason that says the same thing as the proposition using different words.
- **\(<WCB>\)**: Weak Causal Basis: Offers weak or non-compelling causal justifications.
- **\(<FU>\)**: False Universals: Asserts universally agreed points without proof.
- **\(<DEP>\)**: Double-Edged Phrases: Uses statements open to dual interpretations.

### Step 2: Analyze the Content of the String \(<s>\)

Carefully read the argument presented:
1. **Speaker 1**: Jesus was not really crucified.
2. **Speaker 2**: How do I know that’s true?
3. **Speaker 1**: Because the Quran says so.
4. **Speaker 2**: How do I know the Quran is correct?
5. **Speaker 1**: Because the Quran is the Word of God, and everything it says is true.
6. **Speaker 2**: How do I know that’s true?
7. **Speaker 1**: Because God tells us so, here in the Quran.

### Step 3: Identify Keywords and Phrases

- "Jesus was not really crucified" – Proposition.
- "Because the Quran says so" – Basis for the proposition.
- "The Quran is the Word of God, and everything it says is true."
- "Because God tells us so, here in the Quran." – Circular reasoning.

### Step 4: Compare the Content with Definitions

Let’s breakdown the comparison:

1. **Proposition**: Jesus was not really crucified. 
2. **Reason**: Because the Quran says so.
    - **Further Justification**: The Quran is the Word of God.
    - **Further Justification**: We know this because God tells us so, in the Quran.

### Step 5: Classify the String \(<s>\)

This example shows clear circular reasoning where the proposition is justified by the same statement being used to prove itself without external evidence:

- The Quran's correctness is claimed based on itself stating it is the "Word of God".
- This is reinforced with the statement that "God tells us so, here in the Koran."

This reasoning doesn’t provide an independent or logically valid basis for the initial claim.

Thus, the classification based on \(<IDAA>\):

- The string fits well under **Redundant Reason (\(RR\))**: presenting a "new" reason that essentially repeats or relies on the original proposition (the Quran is correct because it says so, and hence what it says about Jesus is true).

Therefore, the string \(<s>\) "Speaker 1: Jesus was not really crucified. Speaker 2: How do I know that’s true? Speaker 1: Because the Quran says so. Speaker 2: How do I know the Quran is correct? Speaker 1: Because the Quran is the Word of God, and everything it says is true. Speaker 2: How do I know that’s true? Speaker 1: Because God tells us so, here in the Koran." is classified as \(<RR>\) – Redundant Reason.
