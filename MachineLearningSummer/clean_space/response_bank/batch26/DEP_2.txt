For 
To apply <IDAA> to the provided string, we will follow the specific steps to classify it as one of the defective argument types:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (IDAA):

1. **Understanding the Argument:**
   - **Input:** The argument string:
     - **Speaker 1:** "We are using thousands of people, who are going door to door to help us spread the word about social injustice and the need for change."
     - **Speaker 2:** "Well then, I can’t be a part of this because I was always been taught that it’s wrong to use people."
   - **Output:** The main claim and supporting reasoning from each speaker.
   
   **Main Claims and Supporting Reasons:**
   - **Speaker 1:** 
     - **Main Claim:** "We are using thousands of people to spread the word about social injustice and the need for change."
     - **Supporting Reason:** Not explicitly stated but inferred to be the effectiveness and need for raising awareness.
   - **Speaker 2:**
     - **Main Claim:** "I can’t be a part of this."
     - **Supporting Reason:** "I was taught that it’s wrong to use people."

2. **Identifying Characteristics:**
   - **Input:** Main claims and reasoning identified from both speakers.
   - **Output:** Key features of the argument.
   
   **Key Features:**
   - Identify if the reasoning provided by Speaker 2 logically supports their main claim.
   - Check for any dual interpretations in the reasoning.
   
   - Speaker 2’s statement "it’s wrong to use people" can be interpreted in two ways. It can mean exploit people, or it can mean employ people for a cause.
   - This statement creates ambiguity opened to dual interpretations: using as exploitation vs. using as employment for a good cause.

3. **Classifying the Argument:**
   - **Input:** Key features identified.
   - **Output:** Classification type.
   
   **Classification:**
   - The statement from Speaker 2 fits into the category where dual interpretations can conflict with the intended message.
   - **Classification:** <DEP> (Double-Edged Phrases)

### Conclusion:

The argument made by Speaker 2, "Well then, I can’t be a part of this because I was always been taught that it’s wrong to use people," is classified as a Double-Edged Phrase (<DEP>) because it uses a statement that can be interpreted in more than one way, creating ambiguity in the argument.
