For 
Let's apply the step-by-step decomposition and application of <IDAA> to determine the defective argument type of the string <s>: "My best friend says you’re a liar, so I’m not going to talk to you."

### Step-by-Step Decomposition and Application (<IDAA>)

1. **Identify the Argument**:
    - **Conclusion**: "I’m not going to talk to you."
    - **Supporting Claim**: "My best friend says you’re a liar."

2. **Analyze for Generalization (Type <G>)**:
    - **Check** if the argument makes a sweeping claim based on a specific instance.
    - **Analysis**: This argument does not make a generalization based on a specific instant. 
    - **Decision**: Not <G>.

3. **Analyze for False Enumeration (Type <FE>)**:
    - **Check** if the argument limits options to fewer or more than what actually exist.
    - **Analysis**: There is no construction of false choices or enumeration of limited options.
    - **Decision**: Not <FE>.

4. **Analyze for Inappropriate Reason (Type <IR>)**:
    - **Check** if the reason given does not logically support the conclusion.
    - **Analysis**: The reason given ("My best friend says you’re a liar") doesn't directly support the decision not to talk to someone, as the opinion of a third party does not logically address the direct behavior or actions of the person accused.
    - **Decision**: This appears to fit type <IR>.

5. **Analyze for Redundant Reason (Type <RR>)**:
    - **Check** if the argument repeats the conclusion in a different form as a reason.
    - **Analysis**: The argument does not repeat the conclusion; the reason "My best friend says you’re a liar" does not mirror the conclusion "I’m not going to talk to you" in different words.
    - **Decision**: Not <RR>.

6. **Analyze for Weak Causal Basis (Type <WCB>)**:
    - **Check** if the causal relationship presented is weak or insufficient to truly support the proposition.
    - **Analysis**: The cause provided (a friend's opinion) does not directly connect causally but instead represents an irrelevant authority, rather than a weak causal logic.
    - **Decision**: Not <WCB>.

7. **Analyze for False Universals (Type <FU>)**:
    - **Check** if the argument relies on universally agreed-upon points without proof.
    - **Analysis**: The argument does not invoke universally agreed points; it cites a specific individual’s (best friend) opinion.
    - **Decision**: Not <FU>.

8. **Analyze for Double-Edged Phrases (Type <DEP>)**:
    - **Check** if the statements used are open to dual interpretations or could be used against the speaker.
    - **Analysis**: The statement is not open to dual interpretations nor does it have a phrase that can be twisted against the speaker.
    - **Decision**: Not <DEP>.

9. **Review and Final Classification**:
    - **Review**: The argument is best classified as providing an inappropriate reason since the conclusion to not talk to someone based on a third party’s accusation (best friend's opinion) doesn’t logically support the proposition.
    - **Finalize**: The best classification for the string "My best friend says you’re a liar, so I’m not going to talk to you." is type <IR>.

Therefore, we classify <s> as <IR>.
