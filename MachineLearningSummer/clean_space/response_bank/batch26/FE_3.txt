Sure! Let's apply the decomposition methodology (IDAA) to the string "People either like coffee or hate it."

### Step-by-Step Decomposition for Classifying Defective Arguments:

1. **Initial Analysis**:
    - **Step a**: Read the string \( s \) carefully.
        - The string \( s \) is: "People either like coffee or hate it."
    - **Step b**: Determine the primary claim or argument within the string.
        - Primary claim: People have only two options regarding coffee: they either like it or hate it.

2. **Identify Argument Characteristics**:
    - **Step c**: Identify whether the argument makes a generalization based on a specific instance.
        - No, it does not make a generalization based on a specific instance.
    - **Step d**: Check if the argument falsely lists options, either fewer or more than actually exist.
        - Yes, it presents an either/or scenario (like or hate) without considering the possibility of indifference or neutral feelings.
        - **Identification**: True for \(\textbf{<FE>}\).
    - **Step e**: Assess if the argument provides a reason that does not logically support the proposition.
        - No, this step is not applicable since the issue is related to the enumeration of options.
    - **Step f**: Determine if the argument repeats the proposition using different words.
        - No, it does not repeat the proposition using different words.
    - **Step g**: Evaluate if the argument offers a weak causal basis for the proposition.
        - No, it does not offer any causal basis.
    - **Step h**: Check if the argument asserts universally agreed points without proof.
        - No, it does not assert universally agreed points without proof.
    - **Step i**: Look for statements open to dual interpretations that could be against the speaker.
        - No, it does not use statements open to dual interpretations that could be against the speaker.

3. **Finalize Classification**:
    - **Step j**: Since step d identifies a specific type, the argument \( s \) is classified accordingly.
    - **Step k**: Only one defective argument type is applicable here.

**Classification**: \(\textbf{<FE>}\).

Thus, by following the decomposition \( D \) and applying the steps sequentially, we classify the string "People either like coffee or hate it" as \(\textbf{<FE>}\) (False Enumeration) because it inaccurately limits the options to only two, ignoring other possibilities.
