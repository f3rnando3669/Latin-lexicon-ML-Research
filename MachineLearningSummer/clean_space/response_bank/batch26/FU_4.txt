For 
To classify "Everyone else is doing it, so should you" using the step-by-step decomposition method, let's proceed through each defined step.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition of IDA (Classification Task)

**Step 1: Identify the Proposition and its Reasoning**

- **Action:** Extract the main proposition (claim) and the supporting reasoning or argument presented in the string.
- **String:** "Everyone else is doing it, so should you."
  - **Proposition:** "So should you."
  - **Reasoning:** "Everyone else is doing it."

**Step 2: Categorize Based on Given Definitions**

- **Action:** Compare the extracted proposition and reasoning against the definitions of the defective argument types (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>).

#### Step-by-Step Application (IDAA)

**Step 2A: Check for <G> (Generalization)**  
- **Criteria:** Does the argument generalize based on a specific instance?
- **Analysis:** This argument does not generalize from a specific instance; it uses current behavior of others as a reason.

**Step 2B: Check for <FE> (False Enumeration)**  
- **Criteria:** Does the argument limit the options incorrectly?
- **Analysis:** The argument does not present an either/or situation or limit the available options.

**Step 2C: Check for <IR> (Inappropriate Reason)**  
- **Criteria:** Does the reason given fail to logically support the proposition?
- **Analysis:** The reason provided ("Everyone else is doing it") doesn't logically justify why someone should do something; it appeals to conformity.

**Step 2D: Check for <RR> (Redundant Reason)**  
- **Criteria:** Does the reason given just restate the proposition in different words?
- **Analysis:** The reason is not merely a restatement of the proposition; it provides a different rationale (conformity).

**Step 2E: Check for <WCB> (Weak Causal Basis)**  
- **Criteria:** Does the argument weakly establish a causal connection?
- **Analysis:** There's no causal relationship being described; the reasoning appeals to social proof and conformity instead.

**Step 2F: Check for <FU> (False Universals)**  
- **Criteria:** Does it assert universal truths without proof?
- **Analysis:** Yes, the statement asserts a universal action ("Everyone is doing it") without providing proof or a valid reason, relying on the idea of following the majority.

**Step 2G: Check for <DEP> (Double-Edged Phrases)**  
- **Criteria:** Does the argument use ambiguous phrases?
- **Analysis:** The phrases in this argument are not ambiguous or open to dual interpretations.

**Conclusion:**

Based on the analysis, the argument in the string "Everyone else is doing it, so should you" fits best with the defective argument type of <FU> (False Universals).

### Final Classification
- **String:** "Everyone else is doing it, so should you."
- **Defective Argument Type:** **<FU> (False Universals)**

This classification is made because the argument relies on an unproven universal assertion to persuade, aligning closely with the definition and criteria for <FU>.
