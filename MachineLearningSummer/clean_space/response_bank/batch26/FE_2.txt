Applying the <IDAA> process to the string "You either support Hillary Clinton for President or you don't believe in women's rights", step by step:

### Step-by-Step Process:

1. **Understand the Argument Types**:
    - Review and familiarize yourself with the definitions of <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, and <DEP>.

2. **Parse the Given String (<s>)**:
    - "You either support Hillary Clinton for President or you don't believe in women's rights."

3. **Identify Key Features in the String**:
    - The statement provides two options: supporting Hillary Clinton for President or not believing in women's rights.

4. **Match Features to Argument Types**:
    - The feature of presenting only two options, when in reality there could be more, matches the definition of <FE> (“False Enumeration”).

5. **Classify the String (<s>)**:
    - Based on the identified features, this string can be classified as type <FE>.

6. **Verify and Confirm the Classification**:
    - Rechecking the string: It indeed presents a false dichotomy, implying that not supporting Hillary Clinton equates to not believing in women's rights, when there could be other nuanced positions (e.g., supporting another candidate who also champions women's rights).

Thus, the string "You either support Hillary Clinton for President or you don't believe in women's rights" is classified as type <FE> (False Enumeration).
