For 
Certainly! We'll apply the decomposed steps (IDAA) to the provided string: "Paranormal activity is real because I have experienced what can only be described as paranormal activity."

### Step-by-Step Decomposition of Task <t> into <D> for <IDA>:

#### Step 1: Understanding the Argument
- **Main Proposition**: "Paranormal activity is real."
- **Supporting Reason**: "I have experienced what can only be described as paranormal activity."

#### Step 2: Identifying Key Features
- **Key Phrases**: "Paranormal activity is real," "I have experienced," "what can only be described as paranormal activity."
- **Type of Reasoning**: An individual's experience is used to support the claim about the reality of paranormal activity.

#### Step 3: Matching to Defective Argument Types
- **<G> (Generalization)**: Claims a general truth based on specific instances (personal experience).
- **<FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>**: We need to check these types for possible matches.

#### Step 4: Eliminating Non-Matching Types
- **<FE> (False Enumeration)**: No listing of options involved.
- **<IR> (Inappropriate Reason)**: The reason is relevant but is based on specific personal experience.
- **<RR> (Redundant Reason)**: No repetition or rephrasing of the same proposition.
- **<WCB> (Weak Causal Basis)**: Not explicitly presenting a causal relationship.
- **<FU> (False Universals)**: Not asserting a widely agreed point without proof.
- **<DEP> (Double-Edged Phrases)**: No ambiguity or duality in the interpretation.

#### Step 5: Final Classification
- The argument can be classified as **<G> (Generalization)** because the general claim ("Paranormal activity is real") is based on a specific personal experience ("I have experienced ... as paranormal activity").
  
Thus, after applying the decomposition process to the statement, we classify it as a **Generalization (<G>)**.
