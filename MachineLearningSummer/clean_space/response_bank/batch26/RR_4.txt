For 
Certainly, let's apply the IDAA process to classify the argument:

### Argument: "That restaurant is popular because everyone in town goes there."

### Step 1: Understand and Identify Essential Elements

1. **Read and Understand the Argument**:
   - Main Proposition: The restaurant is popular.
   - Reason Given: Everyone in town goes there.

### Step 2: Evaluate the Argument Based on Defined Types

2. **Check for Generalization (<G>)**:
   - Does the argument make a broad generalization based on a specific instance?
   - No, it ties the restaurant's popularity specifically to its patronage by everyone in town.

3. **Check for False Enumeration (<FE>)**:
   - Does the argument present a limited or excessive number of options that do not cover all possibilities?
   - No, this isn't about presenting limited options; it’s about a reason given for the restaurant’s popularity.

4. **Check for Inappropriate Reason (<IR>)**:
   - Does the reason logically support the proposition, or is it irrelevant?
   - The reason "everyone in town goes there" does logically connect to why the restaurant might be considered popular.

5. **Check for Redundant Reason (<RR>)**:
   - Does the reason provided simply restate the proposition using different words without introducing new information?
   - No, the reason explains why the restaurant is considered popular rather than merely restating it.

6. **Check for Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>)**:
   - Is the causal connection proposed strong and compelling enough to support the argument?
   - While the reason provided does contribute to the understanding of popularity, it could be considered weak because "popularity" could have been established in other ways or factors.

7. **Check for False Universals (<FU>)**:
   - Does the argument assert universal agreement without adequate proof?
   - Yes, it does claim that "everyone in town" goes there, which is a broad, unverified assertion.

8. **Check for Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>)**:
   - Are there phrases that have dual interpretations that could potentially weaken the speaker's argument?
   - No, there aren’t dual interpretations in this specific argument.

### Step 3: Classify the Argument

9. **Classify the Argument**:
   - The argument mostly fits the definition of **<FU> (False Universals)**.
   - It asserts a universal claim ("everyone in town goes there") without providing proof or acknowledging that such a universal statement is hard to verify.

### Step 4: Verify the Classification

10. **Cross-Check and Verify**:
    - Re-evaluating the argument, it indeed suggests universal patronage without sufficient backing information.

#### Final Classification:
Based on the evaluation, the argument is classified as **<FU> (False Universals)** because it asserts a universal claim without adequate proof.

By following these steps, we accurately decomposed and classified the argument "That restaurant is popular because everyone in town goes there" as a False Universal.
