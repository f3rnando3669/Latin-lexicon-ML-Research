For 
To classify the argument in the string "Officer, I was only driving as fast as everyone around me. I'm sure I wasn't speeding." using the defined defective argument types (\( <G> \), \( <FE> \), \( <IR> \), \( <RR> \), \( <WCB> \), \( <FU> \), \( <DEP> \)), we will apply the step-by-step decomposition (\( <IDAA> \)).

### Applying \( <IDAA> \):

**Step 1: Understand the Definition of Defective Argument Types**
- \( <G> \): Generalization
- \( <FE> \): False Enumeration
- \( <IR> \): Inappropriate Reason
- \( <RR> \): Redundant Reason
- \( <WCB> \): Weak Causal Basis
- \( <FU> \): False Universals
- \( <DEP> \): Double-Edged Phrases

**Step 2: Parse and Analyze \( <s> \)**
- Given string ( \( <s> \) ): "Officer, I was only driving as fast as everyone around me. I'm sure I wasn't speeding."
- Proposition: "I wasn't speeding."
- Reason: "I was only driving as fast as everyone around me."

**Step 3: Identify Keywords and Phrases**
- Keywords: "everyone around me"

**Step 4: Compare with Argument Types**

**4.1: Check for Generalization (\( <G> \))**
- This string does not make a sweeping generalization based on a specific instance, so it is not a \( <G> \) type.

**4.2: Check for False Enumeration (\( <FE> \))**
- This string does not list fewer or more options than actually exist, so it is not a \( <FE> \) type.

**4.3: Check for Inappropriate Reason (\( <IR> \))**
- The reason provided ("I was only driving as fast as everyone around me") does not logically support the proposition ("I'm sure I wasn't speeding"). It implies that if others are speeding, it justifies the speakerâ€™s behavior, which is irrelevant to the actual speeding law. This can be categorized under \( <IR> \).

**4.4: Check for Redundant Reason (\( <RR> \))**
- The reason is not just a rephrasing of the proposition itself. So it is not \( <RR> \).

**4.5: Check for Weak Causal Basis (\( <WCB> \))**
- There is no causal relationship claimed; thus, it is not \( <WCB> \).

**4.6: Check for False Universals (\( <FU> \))**
- By stating "everyone around me," it implies that the behavior is universally accepted or common ('bandwagon' argument), indicating a \( <FU> \) type.

**4.7: Check for Double-Edged Phrases (\( <DEP> \))**
- The argument does not have dual interpretations that work against the speaker. Thus, it is not \( <DEP> \).

**Step 5: Assign Classification**
- Based on the analysis, the statement fits both \( <IR> \) and \( <FU> \) definitions:
    - \( <IR> \): The reason provided does not logically support the proposition.
    - \( <FU> \): It appeals to the universal behavior ("everyone around me") as justification.

Given this, we may select the most fitting classification. The primary flaw appears to be the appeal to the commonness of the behavior (an appeal to popularity), making \( <FU> \) the most accurate classification.

### Decision:
The string \( <s> \) "Officer, I was only driving as fast as everyone around me. I'm sure I wasn't speeding." is most appropriately classified as \( <FU> \) (False Universals).
