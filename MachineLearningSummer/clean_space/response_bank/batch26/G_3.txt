### Step-by-Step Application of <IDAA>:

#### Sample String:
"One of our clients doubled their conversions after changing all their landing page text to bright red. Therefore, changing all text to red is a proven way to double conversions."

#### Step 1: Understand the Given String
- **Proposition:** Changing all text to red is a proven way to double conversions.
- **Supporting Statement:** One client doubled their conversions after changing their landing page text to bright red.

#### Step 2: Identify Key Clues in <s>
- **Keywords and Phrases:** "One of our clients" (specific instance), "Therefore" (implied causation and generalization), "proven way" (assertion of universal effectiveness based on single instance).

#### Step 3: Match Clues to Defective Argument Types
- The argument tries to generalize a specific instance (one client's experience) into a universal truth (proven way to double conversions). This matches the characteristics of a **Generalization (G)**.
- Additionally, it implies a causation between changing text color and the increase in conversions based on one example, which is a **Weak Causal Basis (WCB)**.

#### Step 4: Validate the Classification
- **Generalization (G):** The claim that changing text color universally leads to doubled conversions based on one client's experience is a classic case of overgeneralization.
- **Weak Causal Basis (WCB):** The argument lacks sufficient evidence to establish a strong causal relationship; it relies on a single anecdote which isn't compelling enough to generalize.

#### Step 5: Document the Classification
- **Primary Classification:** <G>
  - **Rationale:** The argument makes a broad claim (changing text to red doubles conversions) founded on the isolated result of one client, which is insufficient to support such a general truth.
- **Secondary Classification (if required for deeper analysis):** <WCB>
  - **Rationale:** The causal link established between text color and conversion rates is weak and not substantiated by robust evidence.

By following these steps, the string is primarily classified as <G> (Generalization) with a potential secondary classification of <WCB> (Weak Causal Basis).
