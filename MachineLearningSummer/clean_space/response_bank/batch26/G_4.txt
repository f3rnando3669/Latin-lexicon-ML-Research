For 
Let's apply the detailed decomposition of the advanced task <IDA> (classifying a string <s> into one of the defective argument types) using the decomposition technique <IDAA> to the specific string "Three kids in one class failed the Jane Eyre quiz, I guess, all the other classes will all fail it, too."

### Step-by-Step Application of <IDAA>:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - Receive string <s>.
   - String <s>: "Three kids in one class failed the Jane Eyre quiz, I guess, all the other classes will all fail it, too."

2. **Initial Parsing:**
   - Identify the proposition and supporting premises in the string.
     - Proposition: "all the other classes will all fail it, too."
     - Supporting premise: "Three kids in one class failed the Jane Eyre quiz."

3. **Classification Process:**
   - **Evaluate for <G> (Generalization):**
     - Is there an overgeneralization based on a single or a few instances?
     - Yes, the proposition "all the other classes will all fail it, too" is inferred from the specific instance of "Three kids in one class failed the Jane Eyre quiz."
     - This suggests an overgeneralization from a limited sample to a broader population.
     - **Classification: Strong possibility of <G>.**

   - **Evaluate for <FE> (False Enumeration):**
     - Does the argument present a false dichotomy or list fewer options?
     - No, this does not involve listing options or false dichotomy.
     - **Classification: Not <FE>.**

   - **Evaluate for <IR> (Inappropriate Reason):**
     - Is the reason given irrelevant or not logically supporting?
     - The reason (one class's performance) is somewhat related but overgeneralized.
     - **Classification: Not <IR>.**

   - **Evaluate for <RR> (Redundant Reason):**
     - Does the reason restate the proposition using different words without new information?
     - No, it does not restate the proposition in different words.
     - **Classification: Not <RR>.**

   - **Evaluate for <WCB> (Weak Causal Basis):**
     - Is the causal connection weak or unfounded?
     - The causal basis (one class's failure leading to other classes failing) could be weak but isn't explicitly presented as a causal connection.
     - **Classification: Not <WCB>.**

   - **Evaluate for <FU> (False Universals):**
     - Look for claims presented as universally agreed upon without proof.
     - No, it does not present as a universally agreed point.
     - **Classification: Not <FU>.**

   - **Evaluate for <DEP> (Double-Edged Phrases):**
     - Are there statements open to dual interpretations?
     - No, it doesnâ€™t seem to be open to dual interpretations in a way that would counter the argument.
     - **Classification: Not <DEP>.**

4. **Final Classification:**
   - Based on the evaluation, it is clear that the argument fits the definition of <G> (Generalization) most accurately.
   - The argument overgeneralizes from the specific instance of three kids failing a quiz to a broad conclusion that all other classes will fail.

5. **Output the Result:**
   - The string <s> is classified as type <G>.

### Result:
The string "Three kids in one class failed the Jane Eyre quiz, I guess, all the other classes will all fail it, too." is classified as of type <G> (Generalization).
