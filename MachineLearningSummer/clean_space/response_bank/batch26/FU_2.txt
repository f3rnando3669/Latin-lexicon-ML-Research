To apply the task <IDAA> to the string "Encourages the audience to become part of a group or act because other people are acting in the same way," we will follow the structured steps outlined in the decomposition approach. Let's execute the steps one by one:

### Step-by-Step Execution of <IDAA>

1. **Initial Assessment**:
   - Read the string carefully: "Encourages the audience to become part of a group or act because other people are acting in the same way."

2. **Identify Assertion and Support**:
   - Main proposition: The audience should become part of a group or act in a certain way.
   - Supporting evidence: Because other people are acting in the same way.
   
3. **Analyze the Logic of the Argument**:
   - The claim is that the audience should join or act because many other people are doing so.
   - This argument leverages the support that the behavior of others justifies the action.

4. **Compare with Defective Argument Types**:
   - **Generalization (<G>)**: No specific instance leading to a broad claim. 
   - **False Enumeration (<FE>)**: Not listing limited options.
   - **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>)**: The reason given (others doing it) may not logically support the necessity or correctness of the action, but let's check other types.
   - **Redundant Reason (<RR>)**: No redundancy; the proposition and support are distinct.
   - **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: Not seeking to establish causality.
   - **False Universals (<FU>)**: The argument is strongly suggesting that because everyone else is doing it, it should also be done by the audience, without providing independent justification.
   - **Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>)**: No dual interpretations.

5. **Classify the Argument**:
   - The argument fits best with **False Universals (FU)**. The reasoning presented is essentially an appeal to popularity (i.e., others are doing it, so it must be right or should be done), which is a hallmark of <FU>.

### Conclusion
Based on our structured analysis, the string "Encourages the audience to become part of a group or act because other people are acting in the same way." is classified as <FU>.

Thus, the application of <IDAA> to the given string leads to the classification of <FU>.
