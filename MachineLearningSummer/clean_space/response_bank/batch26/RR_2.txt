For 
Let's apply the <IDAA> process to the given string: "We need to fix our broken judicial system by electing new people."

### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### Step 1: Understand the Argument Types
- **Generalization (<G>)**: Claims a general truth based on a specific instance.
- **False Enumeration (<FE>)**: Lists fewer or more options than actually exist.
- **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>)**: Provides a reason that doesn't logically support the proposition.
- **Redundant Reason (<RR>)**: Reason that is presented as new but says the same thing as the proposition using different words.
- **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: Offers a causal basis that is not compelling enough.
- **False Universals (<FU>)**: Asserts universally agreed points without proof.
- **Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>)**: Uses statements open to dual interpretations, potentially against the speaker.

#### Step 2: Identify Keywords and Patterns
- **<G>**: Look for strong words that generalize ("all", "never", "always").
- **<FE>**: Look for limited choices or false dilemmas.
- **<IR>**: Check alignment between reason and proposition.
- **<RR>**: Look for repetitive reasoning that restates the proposition.
- **<WCB>**: Analyze the strength of the causal link.
- **<FU>**: Look for assumptions of universal agreement or popularity.
- **<DEP>**: Identify ambiguous interpretations.

#### Step 3: Analyze the String
**For the given string \( <s> \):**
1. **Generalization Check (<G>)**: 
    - The string does not claim a general truth based on a specific instance. It makes an assertion about the judicial system needing fixing but does not generalize from a specific example.
    - **Verdict**: No.

2. **False Enumeration Check (<FE>)**: 
    - The string suggests that electing new people is the only way to fix the judicial system. This presents a limited choice, ignoring other possible solutions.
    - **Verdict**: Yes, there's a possibility this is <FE>.

3. **Inappropriate Reason Check (<IR>)**: 
    - Does the reasoning "by electing new people" logically support fixing the judicial system? The reasoning appears to misalign with the proposition since electing new people is not the only way to address judicial issues.
    - **Verdict**: Yes, this could be <IR> as it offers a reason that may not logically support the proposition.

4. **Redundant Reason Check (<RR>)**:
    - The reason does not simply restate the proposition using different words.
    - **Verdict**: No.

5. **Weak Causal Basis Check (<WCB>)**: 
    - Evaluates if the causal basis (electing new people) is compelling enough to resolve the issue. Electing new officials might not necessarily fix a structurally "broken" judicial system.
    - **Verdict**: Yes, this might be <WCB>.

6. **False Universals Check (<FU>)**: 
    - The string does not assert a universally agreed point without proof.
    - **Verdict**: No.

7. **Double-Edged Phrases Check (<DEP>)**: 
    - The statement is not particularly open to dual interpretations.
    - **Verdict**: No.

#### Step 4: Classify the String
- Since the statement mostly fits multiple checks, we should determine the closest match for the primary defective argument type:
    - **False Enumeration (<FE>)**: Limiting the choice to electing new people.
    - **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>)**: Providing a reason that does not logically support the proposition.
    - **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: Offering a causal basis that is not compelling enough.

**Final Classification**: The most fitting classification is **<FE>** for false enumeration, as it frames the solution as having fewer options than actually exist.
