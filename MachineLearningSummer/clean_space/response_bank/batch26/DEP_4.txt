For 
Let's apply the step-by-step decomposition of IDAA to classify the string "It is immoral to kill an innocent human being. Fetuses are innocent human beings. Therefore, it is immoral to kill fetuses."

### Steps for IDAA:

1. **Step 1: Understand the String (`s`)**
   - Read and comprehend the statement: It is making a moral argument about the immorality of killing innocent human beings, applying this to fetuses.

2. **Step 2: Identify Argument Characteristics**
   - The statement consists of premises ("It is immoral to kill an innocent human being", "Fetuses are innocent human beings") leading to a conclusion ("Therefore, it is immoral to kill fetuses").
   - Key characteristics:
     - The argument applies a general moral stance to a specific case.
     - It uses specific definitions or assertions (fetuses as innocent human beings) to derive a new moral conclusion.

3. **Step 3: Match Characteristics to Argument Types**
   - Examine the characteristics to see if they match any defective argument types:
     - Generalization (G): Not applicable. The string does not make a general claim based on a specific instance.
     - False Enumeration (FE): Not applicable. There is no listing of limited or excessive options.
     - Inappropriate Reason (IR): Not applicable. The premises provided are directly related to the moral argument.
     - Redundant Reason (RR): Not applicable. The premises and conclusion are phrased differently and not repetitive.
     - Weak Causal Basis (WCB): Not applicable. The argument is not based on a cause-and-effect relationship.
     - False Universals (FU): Partially applicable. The moral premise is being asserted as universally true.
     - Double-Edged Phrases (DEP): Not applicable. No dual interpretations of phrases presented.

4. **Step 4: Determine the Most Suitable Argument Type**
   - The most relevant type seems to be <FU> (False Universals) because the argument assumes universally agreed moral truths without explicit support or consideration of different perspectives on when personhood begins.

5. **Step 5: Classification Decision**
   - Assign the string `s` to the identified argument type:
      - Argument Type: <FU> (False Universals).
   - Rationale: The argument uses a universally agreed moral principle ("It is immoral to kill an innocent human being") and applies it to fetuses, assuming a universally accepted definition of fetuses as innocent human beings without addressing counterviews or providing proof of broader agreement on the premise.

Result: The string "It is immoral to kill an innocent human being. Fetuses are innocent human beings. Therefore, it is immoral to kill fetuses." is classified as <FU> (False Universals).
