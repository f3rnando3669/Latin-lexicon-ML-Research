For 
Let's apply the steps of \(<D>\) to the given argument "That restaurant is popular because everyone in town goes there." for the classification task \(<IDAA>\).

### Step-by-Step Decomposition and Application:

1. **Identify Argument Structure:**
    - The structure of the statement is causative, stating that the restaurant's popularity is due to everyone in town going there.

2. **Evaluate Context:**
    - The statement is trying to provide a reason for the restaurant's popularity by saying that it is popular because everyone in town frequents it.

3. **Match Characteristics:**
    - This matches the characteristics of **False Universals (FU)**. The argument is asserting a universally agreed point ("everyone in town goes there") as a reason without proper evidence or logical support.

4. **Classification:**
    - Based on the matching characteristics, classify the argument as **\(<FU>\)**.

5. **Validation:**
    - Cross-reference the definition: "You appealed to popularity or the fact that many people do something as an attempted form of validation."
    - This indeed fits the example: "Stating that something should be done (or agreed to) because everyone else thinks this way," which corresponds to the statement given.

Thus, \(<s>\) "That restaurant is popular because everyone in town goes there." is classified as \(<FU>\).

#### Final Application of \(IDAA\):

Given the string: 
\[ <s> = "That restaurant is popular because everyone in town goes there." \]

Applying the decomposed steps:

\[ IDAA(\text{"That restaurant is popular because everyone in town goes there."}) \implies <FU> \]

By following the defined steps, we've successfully decomposed the task and applied the classification correctly to identify the defective argument type as **False Universals (FU)**.
