Certainly! Let's apply the structured approach (<IDAA>) to classify the statement "Encourages the audience to become part of a group or act because other people are acting in the same way."

### Step 1: Identify Key Elements in the Statement

**Statement**: "Encourages the audience to become part of a group or act because other people are acting in the same way."

**Key Elements**:
- "Encourages the audience"
- "become part of a group"
- "because other people are acting in the same way"

### Step 2: Assess Logical Consistency

- The statement seems to imply that the reason for joining the group or performing the act is that other people are doing it.
- This reasoning suggests a form of social proof or bandwagon effect, implying that one should do something because others are doing it, rather than any inherent merit of the action itself.

### Step 3: Match to Defective Argument Types (G, FE, IR, RR, WCB, FU, DEP)

- **Generalization (G)**: Claims a general truth based on a specific instance. Not applicable here.
- **False Enumeration (FE)**: Lists fewer or more options than actually exist. Not applicable here.
- **Inappropriate Reason (IR)**: Provides a reason that doesn't logically support the proposition. Not quite fitting but close.
- **Redundant Reason (RR)**: Says the same thing as the proposition in other words. Not applicable here.
- **Weak Causal Basis (WCB)**: Offers a reason that is not compelling enough. Doesn't quite fit.
- **False Universals (FU)**: Asserts universally agreed points without proof. This fits well, as it appeals to popularity or social proof.
- **Double-Edged Phrases (DEP)**: Uses statements open to dual interpretations. Not applicable here.

### Step 4: Final Classification

- Based on the analysis, the statement "Encourages the audience to become part of a group or act because other people are acting in the same way" aligns most closely with **False Universals (FU)** because it appeals to the idea that one should act in a certain way simply because others are doing so, a form of social proof without solid reasoning.

**Final Classification**: **<FU> (False Universals)**
