For 
To classify the given string "Speaker 1: We are using thousands of people, who are going door to door to help us spread the word about social injustice and the need for change. Speaker: Well then, I can’t be a part of this because I was always been taught that it’s wrong to use people." using <IDAA>, follow the detailed decomposition process:

1. **Input and Output for the Classification Task (IDA)**:
   - **Input**: The string.
   - **Output**: A label indicating the type of defective argument \( <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP> \).

2. **Step-by-Step Process (D) for Task IDA**:
   - **Step 1: Understand the Definitions**
     - Review the definitions of each type.
   - **Step 2: Identify Keywords and Phrases**
     - Look for terms or structures that signal the specific faulty argument types.
   - **Step 3: Analyze the Logical Structure**
     - Examine the logic to see which defective type it fits.
   - **Step 4: Apply Elimination Method**
     - Rule out inapplicable types to find the most fitting one.

3. **Apply (IDAA) to the String**:

   - **Step 1: Understand Definitions**:
      - **Generalization (<G>)**: Claims a general truth from a specific instance.
      - **False Enumeration (<FE>)**: Presents fewer/more options than exist.
      - **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>)**: Provides a reason that doesn’t logically support the proposition.
      - **Redundant Reason (<RR>)**: Repeats the proposition in other words.
      - **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: Offers weak cause to support the proposition.
      - **False Universals (<FU>)**: Asserts universally agreed points without proof.
      - **Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>)**: Uses statements with dual interpretations.

   - **Step 2: Keywords and Phrases Identification**:
      - **Generalization (<G>)**: Look for sweeping conclusions.
      - **False Enumeration (<FE>)**: Look for limited binary choices.
      - **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>)**: Non-sequitur reasons.
      - **Redundant Reason (<RR>)**: Repetition in different words.
      - **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: Weak cause-effect.
      - **False Universals (<FU>)**: Universal claims without proof.
      - **Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>)**: Dual meaning statements.

   - **Step 3: Analyze Logical Structure**:
      - The first speaker is describing a coordinated effort involving many people to promote social justice.
      - The second speaker rejects involvement based on a misunderstanding or misinterpretation of the word "using."

   - **Step 4: Apply Elimination Method**:
      - **Generalization (<G>)**: No sweeping conclusion is being made.
      - **False Enumeration (<FE>)**: No false dichotomy is presented.
      - **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>)**: The reason provided (moral teaching about 'using' people) seems disconnected from the supportive action described by Speaker 1.
      - **Redundant Reason (<RR>)**: No repeated statement in different words.
      - **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: Not a weak cause-effect scenario.
      - **False Universals (<FU>)**: No universally agreed point is asserted.
      - **Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>)**: The term "using people" is misinterpreted by Speaker 2, leading to a pseudo-ethical objection.

**Conclusion**:
Given the interpretation issue by the second speaker regarding "using people," the most fitting classification is **Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>)**. The second speaker takes "using" to mean exploitation rather than participation, indicative of <DEP>.

### Result:

The classification of the string is **<DEP>** (Double-Edged Phrases).
