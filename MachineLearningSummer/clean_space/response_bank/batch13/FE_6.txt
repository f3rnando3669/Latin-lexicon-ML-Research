For 
To classify the statement "You either support Hillary Clinton for President or you don't believe in women's rights" using the decomposition approach, we can follow the steps described above.

### Step 1: Analyze the statement `<s>`

**Main claim/proposition:**
- The statement is a binary choice: supporting Hillary Clinton for President.

**Supporting reason:**
- The reason is that not supporting Hillary Clinton implies that one doesn't believe in women's rights.

### Step 2: Compare with defective argument types

Now, we evaluate if the statement fits any of the defective argument types:

**1. Generalization (<G>):**
   - This type suggests a general truth based on a specific instance. This does not fit as the statement doesn’t generalize from a specific instance.

**2. False Enumeration (<FE>):**
   - This type lists fewer or more options than actually exist. In the given statement, the choice is binary between supporting Hillary Clinton and not believing in women's rights. This is a classic example of a false dilemma, which is a subset of False Enumeration, where it oversimplifies the situation by presenting only two options when more options actually exist.

**3. Inappropriate Reason (<IR>):**
   - This type provides a reason that doesn't logically support the proposition. The reason here is that not supporting Hillary Clinton means one doesn't believe in women’s rights. This could be considered inappropriate as it creates an unjustifiable linkage, but False Enumeration is a stronger fit.

**4. Redundant Reason (<RR>):**
   - This type repeats the proposition in different words. The statement doesn’t seem to restate the proposition; instead, it presents a false dichotomy.

**5. Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>):**
   - This type offers a not compelling enough reason to support the proposition. While the causal link may be weak, this situation fits better under the false dilemma scenario which is a False Enumeration.

**6. False Universals (<FU>):**
   - This type asserts universal points without proof. While the claim about not believing in women's rights without supporting Hillary Clinton might sound universal, the context of a binary choice is more specific to False Enumeration.

**7. Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>):**
   - This type uses statements open to dual interpretations. The provided statement does not have dual interpretations but rather forces a binary choice.

### Step 3: Classify the statement `<s>`

Based on the evaluation, "You either support Hillary Clinton for President or you don't believe in women's rights" most closely matches the type **False Enumeration (<FE>)**. It falsely presents only two options when more exist (e.g., supporting another candidate who also supports women's rights).

To conclude, the statement "You either support Hillary Clinton for President or you don't believe in women's rights" fits within the **False Enumeration (<FE>)** category.
