For 
Certainly! Let's apply the **IDAA** method to classify the argument "It is immoral to kill an innocent human being. Fetuses are innocent human beings. Therefore, it is immoral to kill fetuses."

### Step-by-Step Decomposition

#### Input Understanding
Let's analyze the argument presented:
- **Premise 1**: "It is immoral to kill an innocent human being."
- **Premise 2**: "Fetuses are innocent human beings."
- **Conclusion**: "Therefore, it is immoral to kill fetuses."

The argument makes a moral claim based on the premises provided.

#### Identify Argument Structure
The structure of the argument is a syllogism:
1. Major Premise: Killing innocent human beings is immoral.
2. Minor Premise: Fetuses are innocent human beings.
3. Conclusion: Killing fetuses is immoral.

#### Compare with Fallacy Definitions
We need to compare each part of the argument to see if it fits one of the fallacy types defined previously:

1. **Generalization (<G>)**: This does not make a sweeping generalization based on a single instance.
2. **False Enumeration (<FE>)**: It does not restrict options inaccurately.
3. **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>)**: The reasons provided (morality and status of fetuses) are relevant to the conclusion about immorality.
4. **Redundant Reason (<RR>)**: The argument does not simply restate its premises to make the conclusion.
5. **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The causal link depends on the validity of moral principles and the classification of fetuses as innocent human beings. This might be contentious but not weak in conventional logical terms.
6. **False Universals (<FU>)**: It does assume some universally accepted moral principles and definitions without explicit proof but typically accepted in many moral frameworks.
7. **Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>)**: The statements do not have dual interpretations that could be turned against the speaker.

Given the options and definitions provided, the argument potentially involves the assertion of universally agreed points without explicit proof â€“ specifically the moral principle and the classification of fetuses as "innocent human beings."

#### Classification
Based on the analysis, the argument could be best classified under **False Universals (<FU>)** because it relies on assertions that are presented as universally accepted moral truths without offering explicit proof within the argument itself.

### Final Classification
The argument "It is immoral to kill an innocent human being. Fetuses are innocent human beings. Therefore, it is immoral to kill fetuses." is classified as **<FU>** according to our **IDAA** method.

This classification is based on the usage of universally assumed moral principles and definitions without explicit substantiation within the argument.
