For 
Let's apply the decomposition process (<D>) to classify the given argument according to <IDAA>:
  
String (`s`): "I thought you were a good person, but you weren’t in class today."

1. **Identify the core claim**:
   - The main assertion here is that the person not being in class today is contrary to the belief that they are a good person.

2. **Determine the structure of the argument**:
   - This statement is trying to connect two aspects: being a good person and attending class. The implication is that failing to attend class means not being a good person.

3. **Evaluate the argument against known argument types**:
   - The argument suggests that failing to attend class directly reflects the person's moral character, which is an inappropriate reason. Attendance in class is not a comprehensive measure of one's goodness.
   - This fits with the definition of **Inappropriate Reason (IR)**, as it provides a reason that doesn’t logically support the proposition that being a good person is shown by class attendance.

4. **Classify accordingly**:
   - This argument can be classified as **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>)**.

Thus, the classification of the argument "I thought you were a good person, but you weren’t in class today." is <IR> (Inappropriate Reason).
