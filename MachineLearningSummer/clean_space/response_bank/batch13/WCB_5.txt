### Application (<IDAA>) to "The reason Donald Trump got elected was because liberals took political correctness too far."

Let's break down the task of classifying the string <s> "The reason Donald Trump got elected was because liberals took political correctness too far."

#### Step 1: Identify the Core Proposition
Extract the main assertion from the string.
- **Core Proposition**: "The reason Donald Trump got elected was because liberals took political correctness too far."

#### Step 2: Define the Argument Structure
Break down the assertion and its supporting argument.
- **Assertion**: "Donald Trump got elected."
- **Supporting Argument**: "because liberals took political correctness too far."

#### Step 3: Categorize Based on Defective Argument Types
Compare the structure and content identified in step 2 with the definitions of each defective argument type: <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, and <DEP>.
- This appears to suggest a causal connection between two events (liberals taking political correctness too far and Donald Trump getting elected). We need to determine if the causal basis is strong or weak.

#### Step 4: Match Specific Characteristics
Verify specific traits that indicate a potential defective argument type.
- **Specific Characteristics**: The argument seems to attribute a complex and multifaceted event (Trump's election) to a single cause (liberals and political correctness). 

#### Step 5: Validate the Classification
Confirm that no other argument type better suits the case.
- **Elimination of Other Types**:
  - **<G>**: Not a Generalization claiming a universal truth based on a single instance.
  - **<FE>**: Not listing limited options.
  - **<IR>**: The reason given does relate to the proposition but does it appropriately support it?
  - **<RR>**: Not merely a tautological redundancy.
  - **<FU>**: Not claiming universally accepted points without proof.
  - **<DEP>**: Not using a statement open to dual interpretations.

The likely candidate is **<WCB> (Weak Causal Basis)**, as it attempts to offer a reason for Trump's election that oversimplifies the actual complex set of factors involved.

#### Step 6: Document the Classification
Record the final decision and rationale.
- **Final Decision**: The argument in <s> fits the defective argument type **<WCB>** because it offers a weak causal basis to explain Trump's election, ignoring the multifaceted nature of political outcomes.

**Example Documentation**:
"The reason Donald Trump got elected was because liberals took political correctness too far." fits the defective argument type <WCB> (Weak Causal Basis) because it attributes Trump's election to a single factor, which is an oversimplification of a complex event. The reason given does not provide a compelling enough cause to explain the multifaceted phenomenon of an election outcome.

By following these steps, the string has been classified as having a weak causal basis, fitting the <WCB> argument type.
