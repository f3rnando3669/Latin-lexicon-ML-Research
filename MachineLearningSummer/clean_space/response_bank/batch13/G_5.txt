For 
Let's apply the concept of decomposition (<D>) to the task of classifying the provided string under <IDA> using the structured steps of <IDAA>:

Given string <s>: "I heard that the Catholic Church was involved in a sex scandal cover-up. Therefore, my 102-year-old Catholic neighbor, who frequently attends Church, is guilty as well!"

### Step 1: Identify the Argument
- **Main Proposition**: "My 102-year-old Catholic neighbor, who frequently attends Church, is guilty as well."
- **Supporting Detail**: "I heard that the Catholic Church was involved in a sex scandal cover-up."

### Step 2: Detect Key Features
- This argument makes a sweeping generalization applying a characteristic of one group (the Catholic Church's involvement in a scandal) to an individual member of that group (the 102-year-old Catholic neighbor).

### Step 3: Match Features to Definitions
- The pattern observed here is assuming that all members of a group are guilty based on the action of the group. This fits the definition of <G> (Generalization), where a general truth is claimed based on a specific instance.

### Step 4: Categorize the Argument
- **Assignment**: <G> (Generalization)
- **Explanation**: The argument generalizes the guilt of the entire Catholic Church over a sex scandal cover-up to an individual church member, namely the 102-year-old neighbor, without any specific evidence against that individual.

Therefore, the defective argument type for the string "I heard that the Catholic Church was involved in a sex scandal cover-up. Therefore, my 102-year-old Catholic neighbor, who frequently attends Church, is guilty as well!" is:

- **Categorization**: <G> (Generalization)
