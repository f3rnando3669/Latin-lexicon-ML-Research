Sure! Let's apply <IDAA> to the given dialogue using the decomposition steps <D> to classify the argument presented:

### Step 1: Identify the Argument

#### 1.1. Extract the main argument or claim(s) from <s>
- **Claim 1 (Speaker 1):** Jesus was not really crucified.
- **Claim 2 (Speaker 1):** The Quran says so.
- **Claim 3 (Speaker 1):** The Quran is the Word of God, and everything it says is true.
- **Claim 4 (Speaker 1):** God tells us so, here in the Quran.

#### 1.2. Identify the supporting statements or reasons provided for the main argument
- **Support for Claim 1:** Claim 2 (The Quran says so).
- **Support for Claim 2:** Claim 3 (The Quran is the Word of God, and everything it says is true).
- **Support for Claim 3:** Claim 4 (God tells us so, here in the Quran).

### Step 2: Determine Argument Type

#### 2.1. Compare the extracted argument against the definitions of <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, and <DEP>.

- **Generalization (<G>):** There is no generalization here based on a specific instance.
- **False Enumeration (<FE>):** No alternative options are being limited.
- **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>):** There are reasons given, but the chain of reasoning itself seems questionable.
- **Redundant Reason (<RR>):** The argument seems to repeat itself.
- **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>):** The reasoning does not rest on a causal relationship.
- **False Universals (<FU>):** The argument is not based on asserting universally agreed points without proof.
- **Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>):** No dual interpretations potentially against the speaker.

#### 2.2 - 2.8 Analysis

- Given the repeated cycling of the argument, this seems closest to a **Redundant Reason (RR)**. The repeated assertion that "The Quran is true because it is God's word, and it is God's word because the Quran says so" amounts to saying the same thing in different words.

### Step 3: Classify the Argument

Based on the analysis, the argument can be classified as:
- **Redundant Reason (RR)**

By breaking down the task into these steps, we identified and classified the argument type as <RR> for Redundant Reason. 

### Conclusion

For the dialogue:
"Speaker 1: Jesus was not really crucified.
Speaker 2: How do I know that’s true?
Speaker 1: Because the Quran says so.
Speaker 2: How do I know the Quran is correct?
Speaker 1: Because the Quran is the Word of God, and everything it says is true.
Speaker 2: How do I know that’s true?
Speaker 1: Because God tells us so, here in the Koran."

We classify it as <RR> due to the repetitious nature of the reasoning used.
