To apply the structured approach (IDAA) to classify "Everyone else is doing it, so should you," we break down the process into specific steps as described. Here we go through each step systematically:

### Step 1: Understand Types

- **Generalization (<G>):** Claims a general truth based on a specific instance.
- **False Enumeration (<FE>):** Lists fewer or more options than actually exist.
- **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>):** Provides a reason that doesn't logically support the proposition.
- **Redundant Reason (<RR>):** Repeats the same point in different words.
- **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>):** Provides a reason that is not compelling enough to support the proposition.
- **False Universals (<FU>):** Asserts universally agreed points without proof.
- **Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>):** Uses statements open to dual interpretations.

### Step 2: Identify Key Elements

- **Main Claim:** You should do it.
- **Supporting Reason:** Because everyone else is doing it.

### Step 3: Compare the Argument to Each Defective Argument Type

- **For <G>:** No sweeping generalization based on a specific instance here.
- **For <FE>:** No enumeration of options is provided in the argument.
- **For <IR>:** The reason given (everyone else is doing it) is meant to support the claim you should do it, but the nature of that reasoning still needs assessment under appropriate criteria.
- **For <RR>:** The reason is not simply restating the claim in different words.
- **For <WCB>:** Not a causal argument with a weak basis; it's more about social validation.
- **For <FU>:** The argument seems to assert a universally agreed point (popularity) without actual proof. 
- **For <DEP>:** The statement does not have a dual interpretation component here.

### Step 4: Match and Classify

The argument most closely fits the category of **False Universals (<FU>)** because it assumes that the popularity of an action (everyone else is doing it) is enough to validate that you should do it too, which it fails to prove explicitly.

### Step 5: Explain

**Classification:** False Universals (<FU>)

**Reasoning:** The argument assumes that because a large number of people are engaging in an activity, it is automatically the correct or desirable thing to do. This is a classic appeal to popularity without providing substantial proof that the action is indeed the right choice for the individual in question. The argument relies on a universally agreed criterion (popularity) as a basis for its claim, but this agreement is asserted without evidence or rational support.

By following these specific steps (IDAA), we categorize "Everyone else is doing it, so should you" as an instance of **False Universals (<FU>)**.
