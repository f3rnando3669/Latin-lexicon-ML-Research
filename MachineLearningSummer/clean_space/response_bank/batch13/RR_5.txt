### Task <IDAA>: Decomposition of <IDA> into specific steps

Let's apply the steps from the task decomposition <IDAA> to the given string and classify it into the appropriate defective argument type.

#### Given String:
"Paranormal activity is real because I have experienced what can only be described as paranormal activity."

1. **Read and Understand the String \( s \)**:
   - The statement claims that "paranormal activity is real" based on the person's own experience of what they describe as paranormal activity.

2. **Identify Key Elements in the Argument**:
   - Main claim: "Paranormal activity is real."
   - Supporting evidence: "I have experienced what can only be described as paranormal activity."

3. **Compare Against Definitions**:
   - Consider which type of defective argument this fits by comparing to the provided definitions.

4. **Identify Specific Markers**:
   - **<G>:** General truth based on specific instance? No, this is not primarily about generalization.
   - **<FE>:** Inappropriate enumeration of options? No, this does not enumerate options.
   - **<IR>:** Irrelevant reason? No, the reason is relevant but may be tautological.
   - **<RR>:** Redundant reason? Yes, the reason repeats the claim in slightly different words.
   - **<WCB>:** Weak causal basis? No, this isn't about cause and effect directly.
   - **<FU>:** False universals? No, this isn't about universal claims.
   - **<DEP>:** Double-edged phrases? No, there isn't dual interpretation.

5. **Match Argument to Type**:
   - The key issue here is that the reason provided is essentially restating the proposition. The support ("I have experienced what can only be described as paranormal activity") is just a rephrasing of the claim ("Paranormal activity is real").

6. **Cross-Verification**:
   - Confirm that other defective argument types do not fit:
     - It's not a generalization because it doesn't generalize based on a specific instance.
     - No inappropriate or incomplete listing of options.
     - The reason isn't irrelevant but is tautological.
     - Not based on weak causal reasoning.
     - Not asserting false universals.
     - No dual interpretations in the phrase.
   
### Conclusion:
The string "Paranormal activity is real because I have experienced what can only be described as paranormal activity." is classified as <RR> (Redundant Reason).

The classification follows the methodical approach as laid out, ensuring accuracy in the identification of the defective argument type.
