For 
To apply <IDAA> to the statement "Officer, I was only driving as fast as everyone around me. I'm sure I wasn't speeding.", we will follow the detailed decomposition steps to classify this statement as one of the defective argument types.

1. **Understand the Definition (Step for each defective argument type):**
   - **<G>: Generalization**: Recognize claims of a general truth based on a specific instance.
   - **<FE>: False Enumeration**: Identify if the argument lists fewer or more options than actually exist.
   - **<IR>: Inappropriate Reason**: Determine if the reason provided does not logically support the proposition.
   - **<RR>: Redundant Reason**: Check if the reason provided merely restates the proposition using different words.
   - **<WCB>: Weak Causal Basis**: Evaluate if the reason offered is not compelling enough to support the proposition.
   - **<FU>: False Universals**: Identify assertions of universally agreed points without proof.
   - **<DEP>: Double-Edged Phrases**: Identify statements open to dual interpretations, potentially against the speaker.

2. **Analyze the given string (<s>):**
   - **Key components**:
     - Main claim: "I was only driving as fast as everyone around me."
     - Supporting argument: "I'm sure I wasn't speeding."

3. **Match the components to the definitions:**
   - **Is the argument making a sweeping generalization?** (**Check for <G>**)
     - No, it doesn't claim a general truth based on a specific instance.
   - **Does the argument limit the options incorrectly?** (**Check for <FE>**)
     - No, it doesn't list fewer or more options than actually exist.
   - **Is the reason provided irrelevant to the argument's proposition?** (**Check for <IR>**)
     - Yes, "I was only driving as fast as everyone around me" does not logically prove "I wasn't speeding". The speed of other drivers does not determine whether the speaker was speeding according to the law.
   - **Is the reason just a restatement of the proposition?** (**Check for <RR>**)
     - No, it doesn't merely restate the proposition in other words.
   - **Is there a weak or non-compelling causal link?** (**Check for <WCB>**)
     - No, this isn't about a weak causal link but an irrelevant reason.
   - **Does the argument rely on unproven universal points?** (**Check for <FU>**)
     - Possibly, as it implicitly assumes "driving as fast as others" is an adequate defense.
   - **Is the statement open to dual interpretations?** (**Check for <DEP>**)
     - No, it is not open to dual interpretations.

4. **Classify the string:**
   - The primary classification here would be **<IR> (Inappropriate Reason)**. The reason ("I was only driving as fast as everyone around me") does not logically support the proposition ("I'm sure I wasn't speeding").

5. **Verify the classification:**
   - After reviewing the key components and definitions again, it is clear that the reason provided is irrelevant to the proposition of not speeding. Therefore, the classification <IR> is accurate.

**Final classification: <IR> (Inappropriate Reason)**
