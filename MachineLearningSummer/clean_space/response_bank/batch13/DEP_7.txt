For 
To apply \( \langle IDAA \rangle \) to the string \( \langle s \rangle \):

"I see nobody on the road," said Alice.
"I only wish I had such eyes," the king remarked..."To be able to see Nobody! And at that distance, too! Why it's as much as I can do to see real people, by this light."

we will proceed through the decomposition process outlined in \( \langle D \rangle \).

### Step 1: Identify Argument Components
1. **Main Proposition/Claim:**
   - Alice claims she sees nobody on the road.
2. **Supporting Statements/Reasons:**
   - The king's remark conveys his wish to see "Nobody" at such a distance.
   - The king finds it difficult to see real people by the given light.

### Step 2: Compare with Argument Types
1. **Generalization (<G>):**
   - Not applicable, as there is no broad claim based on a specific instance.
   
2. **False Enumeration (<FE>):**
   - Not applicable, as there are no fewer/more options listed.
   
3. **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>):**
   - Not applicable, as logical support isn't in question here.

4. **Redundant Reason (<RR>):**
   - Not applicable, since the statements don't simply restate a proposition.
   
5. **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>):**
   - Not applicable, as there are no weak causal claims made.

6. **False Universals (<FU>):**
   - Not applicable, as it doesn't assert universally agreed points without proof.

7. **Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>):**
   - The king's remark uses "nobody" in a dual interpretation:
     - Literal: Alice sees no one on the road.
     - Figurative: The king humorously interprets "Nobody" as a person to be seen.

### Step 3: Classify the Argument
- Given the analysis, the string \( \langle s \rangle \) best matches the type <DEP> (Double-Edged Phrases) because the phrase "see Nobody" can be interpreted in two ways, leading to a humorous interpretation by the king.

### Step 4: Validate Classification
- Reevaluating the statement confirms that the classification is indeed <DEP> due to the dual interpretation:
  - Alice's straightforward claim.
  - The king's playful reinterpretation.

### Final Classification
The string \( \langle s \rangle \) is classified as <DEP> (Double-Edged Phrases).
