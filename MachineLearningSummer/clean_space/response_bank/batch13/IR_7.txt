### Step-by-Step Classification of the Given String

Applying the decomposition steps <IDAA> to the provided string to classify it into one of the defective argument types:

1. **Read and Understand <s>**:
   - The string discusses the logical fallacy of "moving the goalposts" and provides an example related to arguments for the existence of God.
   - It explains how as scientific understanding progresses, proponents of God's existence change their arguments, leading to a form of logical fallacy known as "moving the goalposts."
   - It distinguishes this fallacy from arguments with multiple propositions and describes the analogy from which the term originates.

2. **Identify Argument Structure**:
   - Premises: Arguments for God's existence change as scientific understanding progresses; examples include creationism to intelligent design, and the origin of life as an argument.
   - Conclusion: This constant changing of arguments exemplifies the "moving the goalposts" fallacy.

3. **Check for Generalization (<G>)**:
   - The argument does not claim a general truth based on a specific instance. It discusses a general logical fallacy with broad examples but not a specific instance leading to a generalization.

4. **Check for False Enumeration (<FE>)**:
   - The argument does not limit or overly expand the options; it discusses multiple examples but does not imply there are only these options or an exhaustive list.

5. **Check for Inappropriate Reason (<IR>)**:
   - The argument does not provide inappropriate reasons; it explains the fallacy logically and provides context for the examples.

6. **Check for Redundant Reason (<RR>)**:
   - The content does not repeat the proposition in different words. The explanation and analogy add depth, not redundancy.

7. **Check for Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>)**:
   - The causal basis provided is appropriate and logical within the context of this explanation. It does not exhibit a weak causal basis.

8. **Check for False Universals (<FU>)**:
   - The assertion may fall under false universals as it broadly claims that the argument for God's existence often shifts as scientific understanding increases, a point supported anecdotally but not proven universally.
   - Example points: "Many of the arguments that used to be used for God..."; "Currently the origin of life is a popular argument for God..."; "[...]the “origin of life” argument will fade away and be replaced by another...".

9. **Check for Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>)**:
   - The phrases used here are clear in their meaning without dual interpretations that could work against the speaker.

10. **Classify <s>**:
   - Based on the assessment, the string primarily exhibits a close association with **<FU> - False Universals**. It makes broad assertions about the nature of arguments for God's existence without universal proof.

### Conclusion
The given string should be classified as type **<FU> - False Universals** because it asserts broad claims about argument shifts without definitive universally agreed proofs.
