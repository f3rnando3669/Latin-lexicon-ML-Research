Certainly! Let's apply the decomposition of the IDAA task to classify the given string:

### Given String
"When the judge asked the defendant why he hadn't paid his parking fines, he said that he shouldn't have to pay them because the sign said 'Fine for parking here' and so he naturally presumed that it would be fine to park there."

### Step-by-Step Decomposition

1. **Identify the Proposition**:
   - Main proposition: The defendant argues that he shouldn't have to pay the parking fines.

2. **Assess the Evidence or Reasoning**:
   - Evidence/Reasoning: The defendant's reasoning is based on the interpretation of the sign "Fine for parking here" as an indication that it is acceptable to park there.

3. **Compare with Defective Argument Types**:
   - Compare this with the defective argument types:
     - **<G> - Generalization**: This doesn't apply as it's not making a general claim based on specific instances.
     - **<FE> - False Enumeration**: This isn't about providing limited or excessive options.
     - **<IR> - Inappropriate Reason**: This doesn't fit perfectly either, as the reason isn't entirely irrelevant; it's more about misunderstanding.
     - **<RR> - Redundant Reason**: The argument isn't restating itself.
     - **<WCB> - Weak Causal Basis**: The argument isn't drawing a weak causal connection.
     - **<FU> - False Universals**: This isn't asserting a universally agreed point without proof.
     - **<DEP> - Double-Edged Phrases**: This matches closely because the phrase "Fine for parking here" is being interpreted in two different ways. It has a double-edged interpretation: one that indicates a penalty (fine) and another that suggests permissibility (fine as in okay).

Given this assessment, the defective argument type for the string is <DEP> (Double-Edged Phrases).

### Application Result
For the string "When the judge asked the defendant why he hadn't paid his parking fines, he said that he shouldn't have to pay them because the sign said 'Fine for parking here' and so he naturally presumed that it would be fine to park there," the IDAA task classifies it as <DEP> (Double-Edged Phrases).
