For 
To classify the statement "Farmer McDonald: Ever since they put up that new power plant across the river, we haven't had a bit of rain. I'm tellin' you, mankind has got too big for its britches when it fiddles around with nature." using <IDAA>, we'll follow the decomposition steps outlined:

### Step-by-Step Classification

1. **Identify the Claim:**
   The core proposition is that the new power plant is causing a lack of rain, and mankind should not interfere with nature.

2. **Analyze the Reasoning:**
   The reasoning provided is that the lack of rain since the power plant was built is attributable to the power plant.

3. **Check for Specific Argument Patterns:**
   
   - **Generalizations (<G>):** Is there a sweeping claim based on a specific instance? Yes, the claim makes a broad statement about all of mankind based on the specific instance of the power plant and lack of rain.
   - **False Enumeration (<FE>):** Does it list fewer or more options than actually exist? No, this pattern doesn't apply here.
   - **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>):** Is there a reason that doesn't support the proposition logically? Not explicitly in this case.
   - **Redundant Reason (<RR>):** Is the reason just a rephrasing of the proposition? No, the proposition and reason are different.
   - **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>):** Is the causality weak between the proposition and the reasoning? Yes, attributing the lack of rain specifically to the power plant without robust evidence indicates a weak causal basis.
   - **False Universals (<FU>):** Are there universally asserted points without proof? The statement about mankind fiddling with nature seems more philosophical and does not assert universally agreed points without proof.
   - **Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>):** Could the statement have dual interpretations? No, the statement is straightforward in its interpretation.

4. **Match with Definitions:**
   - Comparing the reasoning in the claim with the definitions, the most fitting argument pattern is **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>)** because the statement attempts to establish a cause-and-effect relationship between the power plant and the lack of rain, which is not sufficiently substantiated.

5. **Classify the String:**
   - Based on the analysis, the appropriate classification label for the string is **<WCB>**.

### Final Classification
The string "Farmer McDonald: Ever since they put up that new power plant across the river, we haven't had a bit of rain. I'm tellin' you, mankind has got too big for its britches when it fiddles around with nature." is classified as **<WCB>**.
