For 
Applying <IDAA> to the statement "We need to fix our broken judicial system by electing new people." involves decomposing the task of classifying this argument into specific steps:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition and Reasoning
- **Proposition**: The judicial system is broken.
- **Reasoning**: We need to elect new people to fix it.

### Step 2: Analyze the Proposition
- **Generalization (<G>)**: Does the statement make a general truth based on a specific instance?
  - The phrase "our broken judicial system" is a generalization, but it doesn't specify an instance supporting it.
- **False Enumeration (<FE>)**: Does the statement list fewer or more options than actually exist?
  - The statement doesn't list options but proposes electing new people as the solution.
- **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>)**: Does the statement provide a reason that doesn't logically support the proposition?
  - The reasoning provided (electing new people) may not logically or directly correlate with fixing the broken judicial system.
- **Redundant Reason (<RR>)**: Does the reasoning restate the proposition in different words?
  - The statement does not restate the proposition in other words.
- **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: Does the reasoning offer a compelling enough basis to support the proposition?
  - The statement suggests a causation (electing new people will fix the judicial system) which may not be compelling or adequately supported.
- **False Universals (<FU>)**: Does the statement assert universally agreed points without proof?
  - The statement does not explicitly appeal to universally agreed points.
- **Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>)**: Does the statement use phrases open to dual interpretations?
  - The statement is straightforward and not open to dual interpretations.

### Step 4: Classify the Argument
- The reasoning that electing new people will fix the broken judicial system does not necessarily address the root cause of the judicial system's dysfunction. It assumes a direct causation that isn't necessarily justified or compelling.

Based on this analysis, the statement primarily fits under **<WCB> (Weak Causal Basis)** since the reason provided (electing new people) lacks a compelling enough basis to logically ensure the proposition (fixing the judicial system).

Thus, the logical fallacy represented here is **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>)**.
