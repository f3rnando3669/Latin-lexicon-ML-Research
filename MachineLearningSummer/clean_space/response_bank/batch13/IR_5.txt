For 
Let's apply the decomposed steps of <IDAA> to the given statement "My best friend says you’re a liar, so I’m not going to talk to you."

### <IDAA> Steps:

1. **Understand the Argument Types:**
   - Recall the definitions of each defective argument type.

2. **Initial Identification:**
   - The statement incorporates someone's opinion ("My best friend says you’re a liar") and uses it to justify a personal decision ("so I’m not going to talk to you").

3. **Context Analysis:**
   - Analyze if the statement is making a general claim or listing options. It does not seem to be doing either. It uses a specific instance (the best friend's claim) to justify an action.

4. **Evaluate the Support:**
   - Determine if the reason provided logically supports the proposition. The reason given is the friend's claim, but does it logically and sufficiently justify not talking to the person accused of being a liar?

5. **Check for Compelling Evidence:**
   - Assess if the causal link or rationale is strong. Here, the justification is weak because it solely relies on the best friend's opinion without independent verification or evidence.

6. **Ambiguity Analysis:**
   - Check if the statement can be interpreted in multiple ways. The interpretation is straightforward with a clear cause and effect presented.

7. **Final Classification:**
   - Based on the observations from steps 2 to 6, classify the string.

### Classification:
The statement "My best friend says you’re a liar, so I’m not going to talk to you" uses the opinion of a third party (the best friend) as the sole reason for the speaker's action. This does not logically support the decision because it relies fully on an unverified external assertion.

**Type:** <WCB> (Weak Causal Basis)
   
The reason ("My best friend says you’re a liar") offered for the action ("so I’m not going to talk to you") is not compelling enough on its own to support the proposition logically. Therefore, the statement is classified under <WCB>.
