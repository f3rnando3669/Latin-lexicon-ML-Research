   - We will look at the phrases and determine their metrical pattern:
     - "This wisdom" (unstressed-stressed, resembling <i>)
     - "have I seen also" (stressed-unstressed for "have I", unstressed-stressed for "seen also"; looks like a mix but primarily /i/ pattern)
     - "under the sun" (unstressed-unstressed-stressed, resembling <t>)
     - "and it seemed great unto me" (unstressed-stressed, stressed-unstressed, unstressed-stressed; resembling mix but could classify as primarily <i> type).

2. **Determine the rhythm and euphony:**
   - Since we observe a balancing of structures and symmetrical phrasing, the rhythm and euphony is:
