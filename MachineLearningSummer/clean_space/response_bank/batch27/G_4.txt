For 
Let's apply the decomposed approach (IDAA) to classify the string "All of those who hate the Duterte administration are CPP-NPA supporters."

### Step 1: Understand Definitions

1. **Generalization (G)** - Attempt to claim a general truth based on a specific instance.
2. **False Enumeration (FE)** - Listing fewer or more options than actually exist.
3. **Inappropriate Reason (IR)** - Providing a reason that does not logically support the proposition.
4. **Redundant Reason (RR)** - Reiterating the same thing as the proposition using different words.
5. **Weak Causal Basis (WCB)** - Offering a weak causal connection to support the proposition.
6. **False Universals (FU)** - Asserting universally agreed points without proof.
7. **Double-Edged Phrases (DEP)** - Using statements open to dual interpretations, potentially against the speaker.

### Step 2: Identify Clues in the String

Analyze the string for specific clues:
- The string "All of those who hate the Duterte administration are CPP-NPA supporters" uses the absolute term "all."

### Step 3: Classify the String

Based on the identified clue of using an absolute term:
- **Generalization (G)**: The string attempts to claim a general truth about all people who dislike the Duterte administration, labeling them as CPP-NPA supporters without the need to provide specific instances or evidence.

### Step 4: Review and Validate

After reviewing, it is clear that the string is making a broad generalization about a group of people (those who dislike the Duterte administration) by labeling them categorically as CPP-NPA supporters, which is an unwarranted generalization.

**Classification: <G>**

By following this step-by-step process, it is determined that the string "All of those who hate the Duterte administration are CPP-NPA supporters" best fits under the category of Generalization (<G>).
