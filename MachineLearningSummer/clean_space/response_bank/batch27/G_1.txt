To classify the string "Even though it's only the first day, I can tell this is going to be a boring course." as one of the given defective argument types using the decomposed approach (<IDAA>), we will follow the steps outlined:

### Step 1: Identify the Argument's Main Claim and Supporting Reason(s)

- **Main Claim:** "This is going to be a boring course."
- **Supporting Reason:** "Even though it's only the first day."

### Step 2: Determine the Focus Area

- In this argument, the claim is that the course is going to be boring, based on an observation made on just the first day.
- This indicates that a general conclusion about the course is being drawn from a very limited sample size (one day).

### Step 3: Match to Defective Argument Type

- The argument is making a generalized statement about the entire course based on a single instance (the first day).
- This matches the definition of **<G> (Generalization)**, which claims a general truth based on a specific instance.

The classified defective argument type for the given example is **<G>**.
