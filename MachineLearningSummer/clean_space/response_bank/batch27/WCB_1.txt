For 
To classify the statement "Every girl I've dated has been a nurse. I must only be compatible with nurses!" within the defective argument types, let's apply the detailed steps from our decomposition process (IDAA):

### Step-by-Step Classification (IDAA)

#### Step 1: Understand Definitions
Reviewing the definitions:
- **G (Generalization)**: Claiming a general truth based on a specific instance.
- **FE (False Enumeration)**: Listing fewer or more options than actually exist.
- **IR (Inappropriate Reason)**: Providing a reason that doesn't logically support the proposition.
- **RR (Redundant Reason)**: Presenting a reason that merely restates the proposition.
- **WCB (Weak Causal Basis)**: Offering a causal basis not compelling enough to support the proposition.
- **FU (False Universals)**: Asserting universally agreed points without proof.
- **DEP (Double-Edged Phrases)**: Using statements open to dual interpretations.

#### Step 2: Pre-process the Input
The statement is already clear, so no additional preprocessing is required:
- **Original**: "Every girl I've dated has been a nurse. I must only be compatible with nurses!"

#### Step 3: Identify Key Indicators
Examine the statement for specific indicators:
- The absolute term "Every" suggests an overgeneralization from specific instances.
- The conclusion "I must only be compatible with nurses!" derives a broad generalization based on the speaker's dating experience.

#### Step 4: Match Against Definitions
- The statement seems to overgeneralize the speaker's dating compatibility based on specific instances.
  - **Generalization (G):** The statement indicates a broad claim "I must only be compatible with nurses!" based on individual instances of dating nurses.

#### Step 5: Use Logical Flow
- The logical deduction confirms that the person is making a general claim based on specific data points (dating nurses). This aligns with overgeneralizing.

#### Step 6: Check Overlap
- **False Enumeration (FE)**: Not applicable as it does not list limited options.
- **Inappropriate Reason (IR)**: The reason is not entirely unrelated, it's inferred from experience, but it's an overgeneralization.
- **Redundant Reason (RR)**: Not applicable as itâ€™s not merely restating the proposition.
- **Weak Causal Basis (WCB)**: Although the evidence is weak, the key characteristic is generalization here.
- **False Universals (FU)**: While it involves an assertion, it is more about generalizing based on specific instances.
- **Double-Edged Phrases (DEP)**: No dual interpretations here.

#### Step 7: Output Classification
- The statement is conclusively categorized as **Generalization (G)**: "Every girl I've dated has been a nurse. I must only be compatible with nurses!" is making a broad, unjustified generalization from limited personal experience.

### Final Classification
The string "Every girl I've dated has been a nurse. I must only be compatible with nurses!" is an example of **Generalization (G)**.
