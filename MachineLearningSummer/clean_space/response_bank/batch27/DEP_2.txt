To apply the step-by-step decomposition and application process (\( <IDAA> \)) to the string "Why does the law state that you have to be 21 years old to drink? Does it really make any difference if you are 20 years and 364 days old? That is absurd. Therefore, if a single day makes no difference, then a collection of 1095 single days won’t make any difference. Therefore, changing the drinking age to 18 will not make any difference," we will follow the outlined steps to classify the defective argument type (\( <IDA> \)).

### Step-by-Step Application of \( <IDAA> \)

**Step 1: Extract Proposition**
- **Task**: Identify the key sentence or claim in \( <s> \).
  - **Proposition**: "If a single day makes no difference, then a collection of 1095 single days won’t make any difference. Therefore, changing the drinking age to 18 will not make any difference."

**Step 2: Analyze Context**
- **Task**: Examine the proposition to understand the following:
  - Is it a generalization based on a specific instance? 
    - No, it is an argument based on incremental reasoning.
  - Is it listing fewer or more options than exist? 
    - No, it is not presenting dichotomous choices.
  - Is it providing a reason that doesn't logically support the proposition? 
    - Yes, it uses incremental reasoning which may not logically support the proposition because the accumulation of "single days" does matter legally and biologically.
  - Does it appear to present a new reason but says the same thing as the proposition? 
    - No, the reason provided is incremental reasoning, which is different in structure.
  - Is it offering a weak causal basis? 
    - Potentially, as it is using incremental steps that do not necessarily add up logically.
  - Is it asserting universally agreed points without proof? 
    - No, it is debating a specific legal provision.
  - Is it using statements open to dual interpretations? 
    - No, the statements are focused on incremental steps and their perceived insignificance.

**Step 3: Classify Argument**
- **Task**: Map the analysis to the specific defective argument type.
  - **Criteria**:
    - **<G> (Generalization)**: Not a generalization.
    - **<FE> (False Enumeration)**: Not a false enumeration.
    - **<IR> (Inappropriate Reason)**: Yes, the reasoning that a small difference does not matter incrementally is inappropriate for changing a legal requirement based on age.
    - **<RR> (Redundant Reason)**: Not a redundant reason.
    - **<WCB> (Weak Causal Basis)**: Could be perceived as a weak causal basis as it doesn't compellingly support the proposition.
    - **<FU> (False Universals)**: No universal claims without proof here.
    - **<DEP> (Double-Edged Phrases)**: Not using statements with dual interpretations.

Given the above analysis, the argument could be classified either as \(\textbf{IR (Inappropriate Reason)}\) or \(\textbf{<WCB> (Weak Causal Basis)}\). 

**Final Classification**: After careful consideration, the primary defect lies in providing an inappropriate reason that trivializes the difference made by one day when in truth, those cumulative days have significant legal and developmental implications. Therefore, the argument in the string \( <s> \) is most accurately classified as:

- **<IR> (Inappropriate Reason)**.

Hence, the string "Why does the law state that you have to be 21 years old to drink? Does it really make any difference if you are 20 years and 364 days old? That is absurd. Therefore, if a single day makes no difference, then a collection of 1095 single days won’t make any difference. Therefore, changing the drinking age to 18 will not make any difference," is classified as **<IR>**.
