To apply the IDAA (application of the decomposition of IDA) to the string "It is warmer this year in Las Vegas as compared to last year; therefore, global warming is rapidly accelerating.", we will follow the step-by-step procedure:

### Step 1: Understanding the Argument Types
Review each defective argument type:

- **Generalization (<G>)**: Drawing a broad conclusion based on a specific instance.
- **False Enumeration (<FE>)**: Presenting fewer or more options than actually exist.
- **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>)**: Providing a reason that does not logically support the proposition.
- **Redundant Reason (<RR>)**: Restating the proposition with different words but presenting it as a new reason.
- **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: Offering a causal basis that is not compelling enough.
- **False Universals (<FU>)**: Asserting universally agreed points without proof.
- **Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>)**: Statements open to dual interpretations.

### Step 2: Analyzing the Given String
Analyze the string: "It is warmer this year in Las Vegas as compared to last year; therefore, global warming is rapidly accelerating."

Key components to consider:
- "It is warmer this year in Las Vegas as compared to last year"
- Conclusion: "global warming is rapidly accelerating"

### Step 3: Applying Criteria for Classification
Match the components to the features of each defective argument type:

- **Generalization (<G>)**: The string takes specific data from Las Vegas (one instance) and makes a broad claim about global warming.
- **False Enumeration (<FE>)**: No enumeration of options, so this does not apply.
- **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>)**: The proposition about global warming may fall into this category if the local temperature variance does not necessarily support global phenomena.
- **Redundant Reason (<RR>)**: No redundancy detected.
- **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The string may lack compelling evidence linking one city's temperature change to global warming.
- **False Universals (<FU>)**: No universal assertion without proof.
- **Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>)**: No dual interpretations present.

### Step 4: Justifying the Classification
Which defective argument type fits best?

- **Generalization (<G>)**: The argument makes a sweeping generalization about global warming based on a single local observation.
- **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The reasoning employed (seasonal temperature difference in one city) is weak in establishing the rapid acceleration of a global phenomenon.

Ultimately, although both <G> and <WCB> seem applicable, the primary issue is the generalization from a single observation to a broad conclusion.

### Conclusion
Given that the argument extends a single instance to make a broad conclusion about global warming, it fits the <G> (Generalization) category best.

Therefore, the string "It is warmer this year in Las Vegas as compared to last year; therefore, global warming is rapidly accelerating." is classified as <G>.
