To apply the steps defined in the task IDAA to the string provided:

### Step 1: Understand the Definition of Each Argument Type
1. **Generalization (G)**
2. **False Enumeration (FE)**
3. **Inappropriate Reason (IR)**
4. **Redundant Reason (RR)**
5. **Weak Causal Basis (WCB)**
6. **False Universals (FU)**
7. **Double-Edged Phrases (DEP)**

### Step 2: Analyze the Structure and Content of the String
Let's break down the interaction:
1. **Speaker 1**: "You should trust the Bible because it’s the Word of God."
2. **Speaker 2**: "How do you know it’s the Word of God?"
3. **Speaker 1**: "Because God tells us it is."
4. **Speaker 2**: "Where does God tell us this?"
5. **Speaker 1**: "Right here, in the Bible."

### Step 3: Match the String to Argument Type Definitions
1. This argument is circular: Speaker 1 is using the Bible to prove the Bible, which is circular reasoning.
2. **Generalization (G)**: Not applicable.
3. **False Enumeration (FE)**: Not applicable.
4. **Inappropriate Reason (IR)**: The reason provided ("because God tells us it is" from the Bible itself) is circular and does not logically support the proposition of trusting the Bible without external justification.
5. **Redundant Reason (RR)**: While the argument relies on repetition and circular logic, it's not simply restating the same point in different words.
6. **Weak Causal Basis (WCB)**: The argument does not give a causal relationship.
7. **False Universals (FU)**: The argument doesn't assert a universally agreed point without proof.
8. **Double-Edged Phrases (DEP)**: The argument is not open to dual interpretations.

### Step 4: Classify the String
Given the context of using the Bible to prove itself as the Word of God with no external justification, this most closely matches:
- **<IR> (Inappropriate Reason)**

The classification of the string is:
- **<IR> (Inappropriate Reason)**

Speaker 1's argument fails because it relies on a reason (the Bible says it's true) that doesn't logically support the initial proposition (the Bible should be trusted because it's the Word of God). The rationale provided is inherently circular and thus inappropriate logically.
