For 
To apply the IDAA steps to the given string "All my friends are doing a low carb diet. That must be the only way to lose weight so I will do it too.", we will follow the decomposition method outlined:

1. **Understand the Definitions:** Review and understand the definitions and examples of the defective argument types <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, and <DEP>.

2. **Analyze the String:** The given string is "All my friends are doing a low carb diet. That must be the only way to lose weight so I will do it too."

3. **Identify Key Features:**
   - The string mentions "All my friends are doing a low carb diet" as a basis for concluding that it is "the only way to lose weight."

4. **Compare <s> with Definitions:**

   - **<G>:** This does not appear to be a generalization based on a specific instance as it is being specific about friends and diets.
   - **<FE>:** The string does not list fewer or more options than actually exist explicitly but implies a limited choice.
   - **<IR>:** The reason "all my friends are doing a low carb diet" does not logically support the proposition that it is "the only way to lose weight."
   - **<RR>:** The statement does not appear to reiterate the proposition using different words.
   - **<WCB>:** The causal basis provided (friends doing a diet) is weak but isn't entirely causal in nature here.
   - **<FU>:** The string asserts a universal claim ("the only way") without evidence, potentially trying to validate because "all my friends" are doing it.
   - **<DEP>:** The statement does not seem open to dual interpretations.

5. **Classify the String:** Considering the strongest alignment:

   - The statement "That must be the only way to lose weight so I will do it too" given "All my friends are doing a low carb diet" strongly resembles <FU> (False Universals) as it asserts a universally agreed point ("only way to lose weight") based on the popularity among friends without any evidence or logical support.

6. **Document the Reasoning Process:**
   - Classification: <FU>
   - Rationale: The argument suggests that doing a low carb diet is "the only way to lose weight" based solely on the fact that "all my friends are doing it," but does not provide proof for this universal claim, thus fitting the definition of a False Universal.

By following the IDAA steps, the string is classified as a False Universal (<FU>) due to the unsupported universal claim it makes based on the action of friends.
