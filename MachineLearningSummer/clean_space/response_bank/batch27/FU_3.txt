For 
Let's apply the decomposed step-by-step process (IDAA) to the string \(s\) = "See the movie that everybody's talking about."

### Step 1: Initial Read-Through
**Purpose:** Understand the general content and context of the argument in \(s\).
**Action:** Read through \(s\) carefully, noting any initial impressions of the argumentâ€™s structure and flow.

- The statement encourages the reader to see a movie because everyone is discussing it.

### Step 2: Identify the Proposition and Supporting Statements
**Purpose:** Determine the main claim (proposition) and the support statements provided.
**Action:** Distinguish between the central claim or point being made and the reasons or evidence given to support it.

- **Proposition:** You should see the movie.
- **Supporting Statement:** Everybody's talking about it.

### Step 3: Classification Checkpoints
Systematically check for patterns associated with each defective argument type.

#### Step 3.1: Check for Generalization (\<G>)
- **Indicator:** Does the argument claim a general truth based on a specific instance?
- **Action:** Look for phrases that apply specific experiences or examples to all members of a group (e.g., "All", "Every", "None").

- The argument does not claim a general truth based on a specific instance.

#### Step 3.2: Check for False Enumeration (\<FE>)
- **Indicator:** Does the argument list fewer or more options than actually exist?
- **Action:** Check if the argument limits options artificially or extends them improperly (e.g., presenting a false dichotomy).

- The argument does not limit or extend the options improperly.

#### Step 3.3: Check for Inappropriate Reason (\<IR>)
- **Indicator:** Does the reason provided fail to logically support the proposition?
- **Action:** Assess whether the supporting statements are logically relevant to the main claim (e.g., ad hominem attacks).

- The statement does not provide a reason that fails to logically support the proposition.

#### Step 3.4: Check for Redundant Reason (\<RR>)
- **Indicator:** Does the reason simply restate the proposition using different words?
- **Action:** Determine if the supporting statement offers substantially the same information as the claim without further proof.

- The supporting statement provides additional context and does not restate the proposition.

#### Step 3.5: Check for Weak Causal Basis (\<WCB>)
- **Indicator:** Is the causal connection insufficient or unconvincing?
- **Action:** Evaluate the strength and clarity of the causal link between the supporting statements and the proposition.

- There is no weak causal basis offered in the argument.

#### Step 3.6: Check for False Universals (\<FU>)
- **Indicator:** Does the argument assert universally agreed points without proof?
- **Action:** Look for appeals to popularity or widespread beliefs without supporting evidence (e.g., "Everyone knows", "It must be true because many people believe it").

- **Indicator Match:** Yes, the argument appeals to popularity ("everybody's talking about it") as support for the main claim.

#### Step 3.7: Check for Double-Edged Phrases (\<DEP>)
- **Indicator:** Are the statements open to dual interpretations that might work against the speaker?
- **Action:** Identify any ambiguities or wordplay that could backfire on the argument presented.

- The statement is not open to dual interpretations that might work against the speaker.

### Step 4: Determine the Most Fitting Classification
**Purpose:** Assign \(<s>\) to the most appropriate defective argument type.
**Action:** Based on the findings from Step 3, select the label (\<G>, \<FE>, \<IR>, \<RR>, \<WCB>, \<FU>, or \<DEP>) that best describes the defect in the argument.

- The argument fits most closely with **\<FU>** due to its appeal to popularity without supporting evidence.

### Step 5: Validate and Finalize
**Purpose:** Ensure accuracy and consistency.
**Action:** Re-evaluate \(<s>\) with the chosen classification to confirm it aligns with the identified patterns and indicators. Adjust if necessary.

- Re-reading and analysis confirm that the argument appeals to popularity ("everybody's talking about it").

Result for the string \(s\): **\<FU>** (False Universals)
