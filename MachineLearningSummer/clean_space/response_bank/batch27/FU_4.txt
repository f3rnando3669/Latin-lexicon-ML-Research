For 
Sure, let's apply the decomposed classification process (<IDAA>) to the given string: "If everyone believes it, you should too!"

### Step 1: Identify Key Elements
Key Elements: "everyone believes it," "you should too."

### Step 2: Compare/Map Indicators
- **<G>** (Generalization): Look for sweeping statements based on single, limited cases.
- **<FE>** (False Enumeration): Identify if options are being oversimplified or omitted.
- **<IR>** (Inappropriate Reason): Check if the reason given does not logically support the proposition.
- **<RR>** (Redundant Reason): Look for repeated reasoning phrased differently.
- **<WCB>** (Weak Causal Basis): Look for weak or non-compelling causal relationships.
- **<FU>** (False Universals): Spot assertions claiming universal agreement without proof.
- **<DEP>** (Double-Edged Phrases): Detect phrases open to conflicting interpretations.

### Step 3: Match Against Definitions
- **<G>**: Not applicable, no single instance or limited case used.
- **<FE>**: Not applicable, no limited options presented.
- **<IR>**: Not applicable, reason provided is not logical, but this is more about universal agreement.
- **<RR>**: Not applicable, not a repetitive reason.
- **<WCB>**: Not applicable, not about a weak causal relationship.
- **<FU>**: Applicable, as it asserts that because "everyone" believes something, it must be true, without providing proof.

### Step 4: Classify
Based on the identified key elements and matching them with the characteristics of each defective argument type, the string fits the pattern of <FU> (False Universals).

### Step 5: Verify/Validate
Review classification:
- The argument uses the belief of "everyone" as proof.
- No actual evidence is provided beyond the claim that "everyone" believes it.

Final Classification: <FU> (False Universals)

Thus, based on the decomposed steps, the string "If everyone believes it, you should too!" is classified as <FU> (False Universals).
