For 
Let's apply the steps for decomposing and classifying the defective argument type (<IDAA>) to the provided string:

### Example String <s>: "We should give the other applicant the job because he has a poor family and he needs to provide for them. It looks like he suffers a lot!"

1. **Identify the Proposition and Supporting Argument:**
   - Proposition: "We should give the other applicant the job."
   - Supporting Argument: "He has a poor family and needs to provide for them. It looks like he suffers a lot."

2. **Analyze the Supporting Argument:**
   - The supporting argument suggests that the applicant's personal circumstances (having a poor family and suffering) should be the basis for hiring him.

3. **Compare to Known Defective Argument Types:**
   - <G>: This argument is not making a general truth based on a specific instance.
   - <FE>: It does not enumerate options incorrectly.
   - <IR>: The reason provided (applicant's poor family) does not logically support the proposition (hiring decision).
   - <RR>: It does not restate the proposition using different words.
   - <WCB>: It does not provide a weak causal relationship.
   - <FU>: It is not asserting universally agreed points without proof.
   - <DEP>: It does not use a statement open to dual interpretations.

4. **Classify the Argument Type:**
   - The string fits the definition of **<IR> Inappropriate Reason** as the reason provided (the applicant's family and suffering) does not logically support the proposition (hiring decision). The hiring decision should be based on qualifications and job fit, not the applicant's personal challenges.

### Final Classification:
- The argument in the string "We should give the other applicant the job because he has a poor family and he needs to provide for them. It looks like he suffers a lot!" is of type **<IR> Inappropriate Reason**.
