For 
To apply <IDAA> to the statement "Since Anna Camacho became vice president of the parent-teacher association, student performance has declined and teacher morale is down. We on the school board believe that Camacho bears sole responsibility for the downtrend," we will follow the steps of decomposition:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition of IDA (IDAA)

1. **Identify the Proposition:**
    - Proposition: "Anna Camacho bears sole responsibility for the downtrend in student performance and teacher morale."

2. **Determine the Context:**
    - Context: The statement is addressing issues of declining student performance and low teacher morale, attributing it to Anna Camacho's position as vice president of the parent-teacher association.

3. **Analyze for Generalization (<G>):**
    - Check if it claims a general truth based on a specific instance.
    - The statement does not make a broad generalization. It is focused on a specific individual and situation.
    - This does not fit <G>.

4. **Check for False Enumeration (<FE>):**
    - Determine if the argument lists fewer or more options than actually exist.
    - The statement does imply a false dichotomy by suggesting only one possible cause (Anna Camacho) for complex issues.
    - However, it still might fit better under another category.
  
5. **Evaluate for Inappropriate Reason (<IR>):**
    - Check if the reason given doesn't logically support the proposition.
    - Provides a specific cause (Anna Camacho) without sufficient evidence to establish a direct link.
    - Potentially fits, but let's evaluate further.

6. **Search for Redundant Reason (<RR>):**
    - Verify if the reason is just a rephrased proposition.
    - The statement does not appear to be rephrasing the proposition.
    - This does not fit <RR>.

7. **Check for Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>):**
    - Determine if a causal relationship is weak or unconvincing.
    - The causal link provided ("Since Anna Camacho became vice president, student performance and teacher morale declined") is not compelling enough to establish sole responsibility.
    - This fits <WCB> as the argument is weak in establishing causality with convincing evidence.

8. **Evaluate for False Universals (<FU>):**
    - Check for universally agreed points without proof.
    - This statement does not assert universally agreed points.
    - This does not fit <FU>.

9. **Identify Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>):**
    - Look for statements open to dual interpretations.
    - The statement is clear and not open to dual interpretations.
    - This does not fit <DEP>.

**Conclusion:**
- The given argument "Since Anna Camacho became vice president of the parent-teacher association, student performance has declined and teacher morale is down. We on the school board believe that Camacho bears sole responsibility for the downtrend." fits <WCB> (Weak Causal Basis) because the causal relationship suggested by the statement is not compelling or sufficiently substantiated.
