For 
Sure, let's apply the step-by-step process \(<IDAA>\) to the string \(s\):

\[s: \text{"Everybody else is doing it, why don't you?"}\]

### Step-by-step decomposition of \(<IDA>\) (Task \(<D>\)):

#### 1. Identify the core argument structure in \(s\):
- **Main proposition:** "You should do it."
- **Supporting reason:** "Everybody else is doing it."

#### 2. Match the argument structure to the criteria of each fallacy type:

- **Generalization (\(<G>\))**:
  - Not applicable; this isn't about making a broad statement based on a specific instance.
  
- **False Enumeration (\(<FE>\))**:
  - Not applicable; this isn't about limiting or expanding the number of options or alternatives.
  
- **Inappropriate Reason (\(<IR>\))**:
  - Not the most fitting here; the reason 'everybody else is doing it' is often used inappropriately for validation but there's a better fitting fallacy.
  
- **Redundant Reason (\(<RR>\))**:
  - Not applicable; the reason doesn't just restate the proposition in different terms.
  
- **Weak Causal Basis (\(<WCB>\))**:
  - Not the best fit; it doesn't focus on weak causal relationships.
  
- **False Universals (\(<FU>\))**:
  - **Matching criteria**; this argument is asserting a point based on the presumed universal behavior of others without proper proof. It uses the appeal to popularity to validate the action ("Everybody else is doing it").
  
- **Double-Edged Phrases (\(<DEP>\))**:
  - Not applicable; the statement isn't open to dual interpretations complicating the speaker's position.

#### 3. Classify \(s\) based on the matched criteria:
- The most fitting classification is **\( <FU> \) (False Universals)** because the argument is appealing to the popularity or universal behavior ("Everybody else is doing it").

Thus, string \(s\) ("Everybody else is doing it, why don't you?") is classified as:

\[<FU>\]
