For 
To classify the statement "Science shows us that improved quality of life comes through research and invention." using the step-by-step decomposition approach (IDAA), we will follow the outlined steps in the decomposition of IDA (D).

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (D):

1. **Understand the Argument:** Carefully read and understand the given statement.
2. **Identify Argument Structure:** Determine the components of the argument (premises and conclusion).
3. **Match Argument with Type Definitions:** Compare the argument components with the definitions of each defective argument type (G, FE, IR, RR, WCB, FU, DEP).
4. **Recognize Clues and Patterns:** Look for specific phrases or structures that indicate a particular type.
5. **Classify the Argument:** Assign the most appropriate defective argument type based on the analysis.

### Application of D to IDA (IDAA):

#### Step 1: Understand the Argument
Let's consider the statement: "Science shows us that improved quality of life comes through research and invention."

#### Step 2: Identify Argument Structure
- **Premise:** Science shows us research and invention are important.
- **Conclusion:** Improved quality of life comes through research and invention.

#### Step 3: Match Argument with Type Definitions
- **<G> (Generalization)**: Does this claim a general truth based on a specific instance?
- **<FE> (False Enumeration)**: Does this list fewer or more options than actually exist?
- **<IR> (Inappropriate Reason)**: Does this provide a reason that doesn't logically support the proposition?
- **<RR> (Redundant Reason)**: Does this present a new reason but say the same thing as the proposition using different words?
- **<WCB> (Weak Causal Basis)**: Does this offer a causal basis that is not compelling enough to support the proposition?
- **<FU> (False Universals)**: Does this assert universally agreed points without proof?
- **<DEP> (Double-Edged Phrases)**: Does this use statements open to dual interpretations, potentially against the speaker?

#### Step 4: Recognize Clues and Patterns
- The statement mentions "Science shows us..." as an authoritative source.
- It makes a broad claim about "improved quality of life" resulting from "research and invention" without specific evidence or considering other contributions to quality of life.

#### Step 5: Classify the Argument
- The statement does not claim a general truth based on a specific instance, so it is not a **<G> (Generalization)**.
- It does not list fewer or more options than exist, so it is not **<FE> (False Enumeration)**.
- The reason provided logically supports the proposition, so it is not **<IR> (Inappropriate Reason)**.
- The statement does not use redundant reasons, so it is not **<RR> (Redundant Reason)**.
- While it offers a causal basis (science showing that research and invention improve life quality), it is not clear if this basis is strong enough to support the sweeping conclusion so it could potentially be a **<WCB> (Weak Causal Basis)** but there might be stronger clues for another category.
- It asserts a universally agreed point "science shows us" without giving proof for the entire conclusion about "improved quality of life," so it fits better as **<FU> (False Universals)**.
- It does not use double-edged phrases, so it is not **<DEP> (Double-Edged Phrases)**.

### Conclusion
The given statement "Science shows us that improved quality of life comes through research and invention." is best classified as **<FU> (False Universals)**, as it makes a broad and potentially unprovable claim without sufficient evidence.
