For 
Let's apply <IDAA> to classify the string "All bachelors are unmarried males" as one of the defective argument types specified: <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>. 

### Step-by-Step Decomposition for <IDAA>:

1. **Identify the Proposition**:
   - The proposition states: "All bachelors are unmarried males."
   - This is a definition, not an argument or claim based on reasoning.

2. **Assess the Nature of the Statement**:
   - Understand that this statement is tautological; it's defining what a "bachelor" means.

3. **Check Against Each Defective Argument Type**:
   
   **a. Generalization (<G>)**: 
   - **Description**: Claims a general truth based on a specific instance.
   - **Analysis**: The statement does not generalize from a specific instance; it’s a straightforward definition.
   
   **b. False Enumeration (<FE>)**:
   - **Description**: Lists fewer or more options than actually exist.
   - **Analysis**: The statement doesn't enumerate options; it defines a term.
   
   **c. Inappropriate Reason (<IR>)**:
   - **Description**: Provides a reason that doesn’t logically support the proposition.
   - **Analysis**: The statement isn't providing reasoning for a proposition. It's a definition.
   
   **d. Redundant Reason (<RR>)**:
   - **Description**: Repeats the proposition using different words.
   - **Analysis**: The statement isn't restating a proposition; it provides a concise definition.
   
   **e. Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>)**:
   - **Description**: Offers a causal basis that is not compelling enough to support the proposition.
   - **Analysis**: The statement isn't attempting to establish causation; it's defining "bachelors."
   
   **f. False Universals (<FU>)**:
   - **Description**: Asserts universally agreed points without proof.
   - **Analysis**: The statement is universally agreed but within the context of defining terms, not making an argument without proof.
   
   **g. Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>)**:
   - **Description**: Uses statements open to dual interpretations.
   - **Analysis**: The statement isn't open to dual interpretations; it is clear and precise in its definition.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The statement "All bachelors are unmarried males" is a definition and does not exhibit any logical fallacies.
   - Since it's simply defining the term "bachelor" in a tautological manner, it does not fit any of the specified defective argument types.

### Final Classification:
The statement "All bachelors are unmarried males" is a definitive statement and does not fit into any of the defective argument types: (G, FE, IR, RR, WCB, FU, DEP). It is a clear tautological statement. Thus, it stands outside the realm of the specified fallacies and cannot be classified as any of the defective argument types.

**Conclusion**: The statement "All bachelors are unmarried males" is a definition and does not fall under any of the predefined defective argument types (G, FE, IR, RR, WCB, FU, DEP).
