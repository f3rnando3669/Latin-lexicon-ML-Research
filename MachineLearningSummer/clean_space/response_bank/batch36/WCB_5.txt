For 
To apply <IDAA> (the decomposition of the task of classifying a defective argument) to the statement "Every girl I've dated has been a nurse. I must only be compatible with nurses!", we'll follow a step-by-step process to identify and classify the argument type.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition:

1. **Identify the Proposition and Reasoning:**
   - **Proposition:** "I must only be compatible with nurses."
   - **Reasoning:** "Every girl I've dated has been a nurse."

2. **Analyze the Reasoning for Logical Validity:**
   - Determine if the evidence provided (all past dating experiences involving nurses) logically supports the conclusion (compatibility only with nurses).

3. **Compare with Known Defective Argument Types:**
   - **<G> Generalization:** Claims a general truth based on a specific instance.
   - **<FE> False Enumeration:** Lists fewer or more options than exist.
   - **<IR> Inappropriate Reason:** Provides a reason that doesn't logically support the proposition.
   - **<RR> Redundant Reason:** Repeats the proposition without adding new information.
   - **<WCB> Weak Causal Basis:** Offers a weak causal basis for the conclusion.
   - **<FU> False Universals:** Asserts universally agreed points without proof.
   - **<DEP> Double-Edged Phrases:** Uses statements open to dual interpretations.

4. **Identify and Match the Argument Type:**
   - **Generalization (<G>)**: The argument generalizes that the speaker can only be compatible with nurses based on the specific instances of their past dating experiences.

5. **Conclusion: Classify the Argument:**
   - Given that the reasoning generalizes from a limited set of experiences to a broad conclusion without sufficient evidence, the argument fits the type of **Generalization (<G>)**.

### Application of <IDAA>:

1. **Identify Proposition and Reasoning:**
   - Proposition: "I must only be compatible with nurses."
   - Reasoning: "Every girl I've dated has been a nurse."

2. **Logical Validity Analysis:**
   - The reasoning generalizes from specific dating experiences to a broad conclusion about compatibility.

3. **Comparison with Defective Argument Types:**
   - **Generalization (<G>)**: The conclusion is generalized from the speaker's limited experiences.
   - **False Enumeration (<FE>)**: Not applicable, no enumeration of options.
   - **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>)**: Reason is contextually relevant.
   - **Redundant Reason (<RR>)**: No repetition, direct reasoning.
   - **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: No causal relationship implied.
   - **False Universals (<FU>)**: Not based on universally agreed points.
   - **Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>)**: No dual interpretation.

4. **Match and Classification:**
   - The argument fits **Generalization (<G>)** as it applies limited experiences to a broad conclusion.

### Conclusion:
Applying <IDAA> to the statement "Every girl I've dated has been a nurse. I must only be compatible with nurses!" classifies it as:

**<G> Generalization**

The statement generalizes a broad truth about compatibility based on limited instances of the speaker's personal experiences.
