For 
To apply <IDAA> to the task of classifying the statement "Radio talk show host, on learning that an association of critical thinking professors had suggested his show as a source of fallacious reasoning: 'Who are these people? They talk to maybe 30 people at a time. I talk to 5 million people every day. They could not begin to do what I do. They are just gnats flying around getting in the way.'" we'll decompose the task of classification into specific steps. 

### Step-by-Step Decomposition:

1. **Identify the Components of the Argument**:
    - **Target of Critique**: Critical thinking professors.
    - **Speaker**: Radio talk show host.
    - **Assertions**:
        1. Professors have a small audience ("They talk to maybe 30 people at a time.")
        2. Host has a large audience ("I talk to 5 million people every day.")
        3. Professors are incompetent in hosting a mass audience show ("They could not begin to do what I do.")
        4. Professors are insignificant ("They are just gnats flying around getting in the way.")

2. **Determine the Core Proposition**:
    - The core proposition is an ad hominem attack where the host implies that the professors' critique is invalid due to their small audience and perceived insignificance.

3. **Analyze the Reasoning**:
    - The host dismisses the professors solely based on the difference in audience size rather than addressing the validity of their critique. 

4. **Compare Against Definitions of Defective Argument Types**:
    - **Generalization (<G>)**: Claims about a group based on a specific instance do not match here. No specific individual behavior is being incorrectly generalized to all professors.
    - **False Enumeration (<FE>)**: Argument does not list options or create a false dichotomy.
    - **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>)**: Examines if the reasons provided do not logically support the proposition:
        - The talk show host's large audience and the professors' small audience do not logically counter the validity of the professors' critique about fallacious reasoning.
        - Insulting the professors as "gnats" is an ad hominem attack and does not address the validity of their critique.
    - **Redundant Reason (<RR>)**: No redundancy is presented where the reason merely repeats the proposition.
    - **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: Not applicable, as no weak causal connection is being made.
    - **False Universals (<FU>)**: Not applicable. No universal claims are made.
    - **Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>)**: Not applicable. No dual interpretations are presented.

### Step 5: Classify the Argument
- **Reasoning Fit**: The reasons provided (small vs. large audience, and insults) are irrelevant and do not address the critique about fallacious reasoning directly; they serve as distractions rather than logical counters.
- Based on the analysis, this statement is best classified under **<IR> (Inappropriate Reason)**, as the reasoning given (audience size and insults) does not logically support or counter the proposition (critique about fallacious reasoning).

### Conclusion
The given argument is classified as:

**<IR> – Inappropriate Reason**

The statement "Radio talk show host, on learning that an association of critical thinking professors had suggested his show as a source of fallacious reasoning: 'Who are these people? They talk to maybe 30 people at a time. I talk to 5 million people every day. They could not begin to do what I do. They are just gnats flying around getting in the way.'" is an example of <IR>.
Type of Defective Argument for 'Radio talk show host, on learning that an association of critical thinking professors had suggested his show as a source of fallacious reasoning: “Who are these people? They talk to maybe 30 people at a time. I talk to 5 million people every day. They could not begin to do what I do. They are just gnats flying around getting in the way.”': <IR>
