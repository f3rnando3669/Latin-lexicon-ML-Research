Certainly! To classify the argument “Everyone else is doing it, so should you” using the <IDAA> approach, we will follow the steps of decomposing the task into specific steps:

### Step 1: Understand the Argument
- **Claim**: You should do it.
- **Reason**: Because everyone else is doing it.

### Step 2: Analyze the Reason for Logical Validity
- The reason provided suggests that the action's popularity (everyone else doing it) is a sufficient reason for you to do it as well.

### Step 3: Compare with Definitions
We will now categorize this statement by matching it against the predefined logical fallacies:

1. **<G> Generalization**: This involves claiming a general truth based on a specific instance.
   - Analysis: The statement does not fit this category.

2. **<FE> False Enumeration**: This involves listing fewer or more options than actually exist.
   - Analysis: The statement does not involve enumeration of options.

3. **<IR> Inappropriate Reason**: This involves providing a reason that doesn’t logically support the proposition.
   - Analysis: The reason is directly related to the claim, suggesting action based on popularity.

4. **<RR> Redundant Reason**: This involves presenting the same reason in different words.
   - Analysis: The statement is not redundant; it directly connects the reason to the claim.

5. **<WCB> Weak Causal Basis**: This offers a causal basis that isn’t compelling enough to support the proposition.
   - Analysis: The statement does not argue causality.

6. **<FU> False Universals**: This asserts universally agreed points without proof or appeals to the general acceptance of an idea or action.
   - Analysis: The statement fits this category as it appeals to the popularity of an action ("everyone else is doing it") as a reason for you to do it as well.

7. **<DEP> Double-Edged Phrases**: This uses statements open to dual interpretations.
   - Analysis: The statement does not feature ambiguity or dual interpretations.

### Step 4: Classification
Based on the analysis, the argument best fits the category of **<FU> False Universals**, as it appeals to popularity and the general acceptance of a behavior as the reason for you to adopt the same behavior.

### Conclusion
By following the steps of <IDAA>, we classify the argument “Everyone else is doing it, so should you” as:

**<FU> False Universals**
