Certainly! Let's apply the process of <IDAA> (the application of <D> to <IDA>) to the argument provided to classify it into one of the predefined defective argument types: <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>. Here’s the step-by-step breakdown:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition and Application

1. **Identify the Main Proposition and Reasoning:**
   - **Main Proposition:** Changing the drinking age to 18 will not make any difference.
   - **Reasoning Provided:**
     1. It's absurd to differentiate based on a single day (20 years and 364 days vs. 21 years).
     2. If a single day makes no difference, then 1,095 single days (3 years) collectively won't make a difference.

2. **Analyze the Structure and Logic of the Argument:**
   - The argument questions the differentiation based on the legal age of 21 by challenging the significance of a single day and then extends this reasoning to question the significance of multiple days.
   - The reasoning attempts to prove the main proposition by reducing the argument to an absurd comparison.

3. **Compare Against Definitions of Defective Argument Types:**

   - **<G> Generalization:** No sweeping claim based on specific instances.
   - **<FE> False Enumeration:** No enumeration or listing of limited options.
   - **<IR> Inappropriate Reason:** The focus is on the age difference, which is directly related but possibly inaccurately represented.
   - **<RR> Redundant Reason:** Presents additional reasoning but not redundant restatement.
   - **<WCB> Weak Causal Basis:** It is not presenting a weak causal basis directly but is giving a logical extension based on an argument from absurdity.
   - **<FU> False Universals:** Not making a universal claim without proof.
   - **<DEP> Double-Edged Phrases:** The argument is not relying on dual interpretations but criticizes the incremental difference.

4. **Identify Specific Characteristics:**
   - The argument relies on the reductio ad absurdum approach to challenge incremental changes, leading to a broader conclusion about the drinking age.
   - This aligns with **<IR> Inappropriate Reason** as it attempts to connect an inappropriate reason (single-day difference) to invalidate a legally established age boundary.

5. **Evaluation of Fallacy:**
   - The core issue here is extending the absurde reasoning to make a broader legal point. 
   - The argument criticizes a legally significant distinction using arguably irrelevant comparisons, making it an inappropriate reason.

### Conclusion:

Based on the steps, the argument "Why does the law state that you have to be 21 years old to drink? Does it really make any difference if you are 20 years and 364 days old? That is absurd. Therefore, if a single day makes no difference, then a collection of 1095 single days won’t make any difference. Therefore, changing the drinking age to 18 will not make any difference." is most accurately classified as:

**<IR> Inappropriate Reason**, since it provides a reason that doesn’t logically, compellingly, or appropriately support the proposition about changing the legal drinking age. 

### Final Classification:
The statement falls under **<IR>**, Inappropriate Reason.
