For 
To apply <IDAA> to the string "It is warmer this year in Las Vegas as compared to last year; therefore, global warming is rapidly accelerating," we'll decompose the task of classifying the argument into specific logical fallacies step by step:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition for <IDAA>

1. **Identify the Proposition and Reason Provided in the Argument**
   - **Proposition:** "Global warming is rapidly accelerating."
   - **Reason Provided:** "It is warmer this year in Las Vegas as compared to last year."

2. **Analyze the Reason Given for Its Appropriateness and Logical Validity**
   - Evaluate whether the observation of temperatures in Las Vegas logically supports the proposition that global warming is rapidly accelerating.

3. **Compare the Reason Against Known Defective Argument Types**
   - Determine if the reasoning fits any of the following defective argument types:
     - **<G> Generalization:** Claims a general truth based on a specific instance.
     - **<FE> False Enumeration:** Lists fewer or more options than actually exist.
     - **<IR> Inappropriate Reason:** Provides a reason that doesn’t logically support the proposition.
     - **<RR> Redundant Reason:** Presents a reason that essentially restates the proposition using different words.
     - **<WCB> Weak Causal Basis:** Offers a causal basis that is not compelling enough to support the proposition.
     - **<FU> False Universals:** Asserts universally agreed points without proof.
     - **<DEP> Double-Edged Phrases:** Uses statements open to dual interpretations.

4. **Classification Based on Comparison**
   - Determine which defective argument type best fits the reason provided in the argument.

### Application of <IDAA>

1. **Identify the Proposition and Reason Provided:**
   - **Proposition:** "Global warming is rapidly accelerating."
   - **Reason Provided:** "It is warmer this year in Las Vegas as compared to last year."

2. **Analyze the Reason Given for Its Appropriateness and Logical Validity:**
   - The observation that it is warmer in a single location over one year does not logically support the broad claim that global warming is rapidly accelerating. This is a weak basis for such a sweeping conclusion about global climate trends.

3. **Compare the Reason Against Known Defective Argument Types:**

   - **Generalization (<G>):** 
     - The argument makes a broad claim about global warming based on a specific instance in Las Vegas.
     - **Fits well**: This matches the definition of generalizing a global trend from a single local instance.
  
   - **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>):** 
     - While the reasoning might seem relevant, it fails to logically support the broad claim.
  
   - **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>):**
     - This is also a weak causal argument as it implies a causal relationship between the temperature in Las Vegas and global warming trends based on minimal evidence.
     - **Fits well**: This matches the definition offering a causal basis that isn’t compelling enough to support the proposition.

4. **Classification Based on Comparison:**
   - The argument fits both definitions of <G> (Generalization) and <WCB> (Weak Causal Basis). 
   - Since it primarily makes a sweeping generalization based on a specific instance, <G> (Generalization) is most fitting.

### Conclusion

Based on the above analysis and classification steps, the argument "It is warmer this year in Las Vegas as compared to last year; therefore, global warming is rapidly accelerating." is best classified as:
- **<G> (Generalization)**

**Final Classification:**
```markdown
Type of Defective Argument for 'It is warmer this year in Las Vegas as compared to last year; therefore, global warming is rapidly accelerating.': <G>
