For 
To apply \<IDAA\> to classify the given argument, we will follow a structured, step-by-step method to decompose the task of identifying the argument type.

### Step 1: Understand the Content
The statement discusses the fallacy of "moving the goalposts" particularly in the context of arguments for the existence of God. It elaborates on how proponents shift their arguments to areas as yet unexplained by science to maintain the claim that God exists.

### Step 2: Break Down the Argument
1. **Observations about the Argument**:
   - Initially, arguments for God's existence were based on observable phenomena.
   - As scientific understanding grew, these arguments were abandoned.
   - New arguments were then formed around phenomena not yet explained by science.
   - This shift is described as "moving the goalposts."

2. **Example Given**:
   - Moving from creationism to intelligent design when creationism was challenged by scientific explanations.
   - Current argument focuses on the origin of life, but if solved, would likely shift again.

### Step 3: Compare against Definitions of Argument Types
1. **Generalization (G)**:
   - This argument does not claim a general truth from specific instances.

2. **False Enumeration (FE)**:
   - It does not present limited or excessive options.

3. **Inappropriate Reason (IR)**:
   - It does not provide a reason that doesn't support the proposition logically.

4. **Redundant Reason (RR)**:
   - The argument isn't rephrasing the same point; it’s illustrating a pattern.

5. **Weak Causal Basis (WCB)**:
   - This argument isn’t reliant on a weak causal connection.

6. **False Universals (FU)**:
   - It doesn’t assert universally agreed points without proof.

7. **Double-Edged Phrases (DEP)**:
   - No dual interpretations are being employed.

### Step 4: Identify the Correct Classification
- The argument distinctly shifts from using one piece of evidence to another, placing always beyond the reach of disproof, thus classifying most aptly as **Moving the Goalposts Fallacy**.

### Step 5: Differences with Similar Arguments
- The text makes clear this fallacy involves substituting new arguments for debunked ones, thereby shifting the criteria for proof such that it becomes unattainable ("moving the goalposts").
- **Initial Claim**: "Has to be", "must", "required for", etc., leading to ad hoc objections once partially answered.

### Conclusion
The argument reviewed is best classified under the **Moving the Goalposts Fallacy**, which fits the specific descriptions and patterns of reasoning identified in the text.

Type of Defective Argument for:
_Possible statement: "Due to science understanding of nature, arguments for God's existence shift to new unexplored areas."_
