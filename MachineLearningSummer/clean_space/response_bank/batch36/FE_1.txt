For 
To apply <IDAA> to the given statement "The museum's new gemstones and precious minerals exhibit needs more security guards. If you don't agree, then you must be planning to steal a piece of the exhibit," we will decompose the task of classifying the argument type into specific steps. Here are the steps:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition and Application:

1. **Identify the Argument Components:**
    - **Proposition 1:** The museum's new gemstones and precious minerals exhibit needs more security guards.
    - **Proposition 2:** If you don't agree (with the need for more security guards), then you must be planning to steal a piece of the exhibit.

2. **Analyze the Logical Structure of the Argument:**
    - Proposition 2 is attempting to support Proposition 1 by suggesting that disagreement implies malintent (i.e., planning to steal).

3. **Compare with Defined Defective Argument Types:**

    **a. Generalization (<G>):**
    - **Description:** Claims a general truth based on a specific instance.
    - **Analysis:** The argument doesn't generalize from a specific instance.

    **b. False Enumeration (<FE>):**
    - **Description:** Lists fewer or more options than actually exist.
    - **Analysis:** The argument effectively presents a dichotomy by suggesting only two options: agreeing with the need for more security or planning to steal.

    **c. Inappropriate Reason (<IR>):**
    - **Description:** Provides a reason that doesnâ€™t logically support the proposition.
    - **Analysis:** The argument uses an inappropriate reason (malintent) to support a security requirement.

    **d. Redundant Reason (<RR>):**
    - **Description:** A reason that says the same thing as the proposition using different words.
    - **Analysis:** The argument is not presenting redundant reasoning.

    **e. Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>):**
    - **Description:** Offers a causal basis that is not compelling enough.
    - **Analysis:** The argument is not offering a weak causal basis.

    **f. False Universals (<FU>):**
    - **Description:** Asserts universally agreed points without proof.
    - **Analysis:** The argument does not claim a universally agreed point without proof.

    **g. Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>):**
    - **Description:** Uses statements open to dual interpretations.
    - **Analysis:** The argument is not based on ambiguous or dual-meaning phrases.

4. **Determine the Most Fitting Defective Argument Type:**
    - The most fitting type appears to be **<FE> (False Enumeration)** as the argument falsely presents a limited set of options, suggesting that the only way to disagree with the need for more security is to plan theft. 

### Conclusion:

By following the steps of <IDAA>, we classify the statement "The museum's new gemstones and precious minerals exhibit needs more security guards. If you don't agree, then you must be planning to steal a piece of the exhibit." as a type:

- **<FE> (False Enumeration)**

This classification indicates that the argument fallaciously implies there are no other valid reasons for disagreeing with the need for more security, apart from intending to commit theft.
