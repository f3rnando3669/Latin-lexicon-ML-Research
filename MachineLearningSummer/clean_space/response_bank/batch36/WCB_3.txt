Sure, let's apply <IDAA> (the decomposition of the task of classifying a defective argument) to the given statement: "I drank bottled water and now I am sick, so the water must have made me sick."

### Step-by-Step Decomposition and Application of <IDAA>

1. **Identify the core components of the statement:**
    - **Observation:** "I drank bottled water."
    - **Outcome:** "Now I am sick."
    - **Conclusion:** "So the water must have made me sick."

2. **Evaluate the Reasoning and Identify Logical Structure:**
    - The statement suggests a direct causal relationship between drinking the bottled water and falling sick.

3. **Compare the Reasoning Against the Definitions of Defective Argument Types:**
    - **<G> Generalization:** The argument is not making a broad claim based on a specific instance.
    - **<FE> False Enumeration:** This argument does not list fewer or more options than actually exist.
    - **<IR> Inappropriate Reason:** While the reason (drinking bottled water) is related to the outcome (sickness), it's not the primary issue here.
    - **<RR> Redundant Reason:** The argument does not simply restate the proposition with different words.
    - **<WCB> Weak Causal Basis:** The reasoning heavily relies on a weak causal basis. Assuming that drinking bottled water is directly responsible for the sickness without additional evidence is a clear example of weak causal reasoning.
    - **<FU> False Universals:** The argument does not assert universal points without proof but rather a specific causal conclusion.
    - **<DEP> Double-Edged Phrases:** The statement does not involve dual interpretations.

4. **Determine the Most Appropriate Classification:**
    - The statement predominantly suffers from a weak causal connection. The conclusion that the bottled water caused the sickness is drawn based on a single instance without considering other potential factors or evidence, which is a clear instance of **<WCB> (Weak Causal Basis)**.

### Conclusion:
By following the decomposition steps of <IDAA>, we classify the statement "I drank bottled water and now I am sick, so the water must have made me sick." as **<WCB> (Weak Causal Basis)**.

Thus, the logical fallacy used in the statement is:
**<WCB> (Weak Causal Basis)**.
