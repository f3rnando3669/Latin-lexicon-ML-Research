For 
To apply <IDAA> to the task of classifying the string "My best friend says you’re a liar, so I’m not going to talk to you," we will break down the process step-by-step to identify the type of defective argument.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition:

1. **Identify the Proposition and Reasoning:**
   - **Proposition:** "I’m not going to talk to you."
   - **Reasoning:** "My best friend says you’re a liar."

2. **Analyze the Logical Structure of the Argument:**
   - The speaker is making a decision based on hearsay from a third party (the best friend).

3. **Compare with Definitions of Defective Argument Types:**
   - **<G> Generalization:** Claiming a general truth based on a specific instance.
     - IR: Not applicable, as there’s no generalization from a specific instance.
   
   - **<FE> False Enumeration:** Listing fewer or more options than actually exist.
     - IR: Not applicable, as the argument doesn’t list options.
   
   - **<IR> Inappropriate Reason:** Providing a reason that doesn't logically support the proposition.
     - IR: Potentially relevant, as the reason (someone else's opinion) does not logically support the action of not talking to someone.
   
   - **<RR> Redundant Reason:** A reason that merely restates the proposition in other words.
     - IR: Not applicable, as the reason is not a redundancy.
   
   - **<WCB> Weak Causal Basis:** Offering a causal basis that is not compelling enough to support the proposition.
     - IR: Not applicable, as there's no causal relationship being suggested.
   
   - **<FU> False Universals:** Asserting universally agreed points without proof.
     - IR: Not applicable, as there's no universal claim being made.
   
   - **<DEP> Double-Edged Phrases:** Using phrases that are open to dual interpretations, potentially against the speaker.
     - IR: Not applicable, as there are no dual interpretations here.

### Step 4: Determine the Most Appropriate Classification
- The reasoning provided is based on an external, third-party opinion which doesn’t logically support the decision to not talk to the person. This fits the definition of **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>)**.

### Final Conclusion:
Based on our analysis, the string "My best friend says you’re a liar, so I’m not going to talk to you." best matches the defective argument type <IR> (Inappropriate Reason).

**Classification:** <IR>

Therefore, the given argument is classified as <IR>.
