For 
Sure, let's apply <IDAA> to classify the argument "We should give the other applicant the job because he has a poor family and he needs to provide for them. It looks like he suffers a lot!" step by step.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition:

1. **Step 1: Understand the Structure of the Argument**
   - **Core Proposition:** "We should give the other applicant the job."
   - **Reason Provided:** "He has a poor family and he needs to provide for them. It looks like he suffers a lot."

2. **Step 2: Compare the Reason Against the Definitions of Defective Argument Types**
   - **Generalization (<G>):** Making a broad claim from a specific instance. Not applicable here, as no generalization is being stated.
   - **False Enumeration (<FE>):** Listing fewer or more options than actually exist. Not applicable here, as no options are being enumerated.
   - **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>):** Providing a reason that doesn't logically support the proposition. This suggests that the need of the applicant's family and his suffering are not logical reasons to give him the job based on merit or qualifications.
   - **Redundant Reason (<RR>):** Repeating the same point in different words. Not applicable here, as there is no redundancy.
   - **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>):** Offering a causal basis that isn't compelling enough. The argument does provide a reason, but it’s not about causation.
   - **False Universals (<FU>):** Asserting universally agreed points without proof. Not applicable here, as the argument does not assert universal truths.
   - **Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>):** Statements open to dual interpretations. Not applicable, as there are no dual interpretations in the statement.

3. **Step 3: Determine If It Fits the Inappropriate Reason Classification (<IR>)**
   - The argument presented is <IR> because it provides a reason (the applicant's family need and suffering) that doesn’t logically support the proposition of giving him the job. While compassion is a valid sentiment, job decisions based on capabilities, qualifications, and job performance cannot be logically supported solely by the applicant's personal hardships.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis and comparison, the given argument "We should give the other applicant the job because he has a poor family and he needs to provide for them. It looks like he suffers a lot!" fits best under the category **<IR> (Inappropriate Reason)**.

### Final Classification:
The given string is classified as:
**<IR> (Inappropriate Reason)**
