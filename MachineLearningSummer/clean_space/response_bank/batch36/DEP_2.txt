For 
To apply <IDAA> to the string "Speaker 1: We are using thousands of people, who are going door to door to help us spread the word about social injustice and the need for change. Speaker: Well then, I can’t be a part of this because I was always been taught that it’s wrong to use people," we will decompose the task of classifying the argument into specific steps:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition of <IDA>

1. **Identify the Argument and Its Components:**
   - **Speaker 1:** Advocates using people to spread the message about social injustice.
   - **Speaker 2:** Objects to the term "using people" based on a moral precept.

2. **Analyze the Types of Reasoning:**
   - **Speaker 1’s Reasoning:** Using volunteers to spread the message.
   - **Speaker 2’s Reasoning:** Interprets the phrase "use people" negatively, implying exploitation.

3. **Determine if the Reasoning Fits a Defective Argument Type:**
   - **Generalization (G):** General truth based on a specific instance.
   - **False Enumeration (FE):** Listing fewer or more options than actually exist.
   - **Inappropriate Reason (IR):** Providing a reason that doesn’t logically support the proposition.
   - **Redundant Reason (RR):** Restating the proposition differently without new information.
   - **Weak Causal Basis (WCB):** Offering an unsupported causal link.
   - **False Universals (FU):** Asserting universally agreed points without proof.
   - **Double-Edged Phrases (DEP):** Using statements open to dual interpretations.

4. **Evaluate Speaker 2’s Response:**
   - **DEP (Double-Edged Phrases):**
     - **Analysis:** Speaker 2 appears to misinterpret Speaker 1's use of "using people" in a different moral context, showing how the same phrase can carry dual meanings:
         1. **Positive Interpretation:** Volunteers are being mobilized for a good cause.
         2. **Negative Interpretation:** Implies unethical exploitation of people.
     - **Match:** Speaker 2’s response hinges on interpreting "using people" differently from Speaker 1, fitting the definition of a Double-Edged Phrase.

### Conclusion:
The classification of the argument in the statement is **<DEP> (Double-Edged Phrases)**. It involves a phrase that is open to dual interpretations, leading to a misunderstanding and objection based on those divergent interpretations.

### Final Classification:
**<DEP>** (Double-Edged Phrases)

Type of Defective Argument for "Speaker 1: We are using thousands of people, who are going door to door to help us spread the word about social injustice and the need for change.
Speaker 2: Well then, I can’t be a part of this because I was always taught that it’s wrong to use people.": **<DEP>**
