For 
To apply <IDAA> to the string "smoking cigarettes is deadly because cigarettes can kill you," we will decompose the task of classifying the defective argument type into specific steps. This methodical approach will help us in identifying the exact fallacy.

### Step-by-Step Process:

1. **Identify the Components of the Statement:**
   - **Proposition:** Smoking cigarettes is deadly.
   - **Reason Provided:** Because cigarettes can kill you.

2. **Analyze the Logical Structure:**
   - The statement asserts that smoking cigarettes is deadly.
   - The reason provided essentially restates the proposition using somewhat different words: cigarettes being deadly implies that they can kill you.

3. **Compare with Defined Defective Argument Types:**
   - **Generalization (<G>):** This involves making a broad claim based on a specific instance. The statement is not generalizing from one instance.
   - **False Enumeration (<FE>):** This involves listing fewer or more options than exist. The statement does not list options.
   - **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>):** This involves providing a reason that doesn't logically support the proposition. Although the reasoning is relevant, it doesn't add new information.
   - **Redundant Reason (<RR>):** This involves presenting a reason that says the same thing as the proposition using different words. The statement seems to fit this category since it uses different wording to restate the same idea.
   - **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>):** This involves offering a causal basis that isn't compelling enough to support the proposition. The statement does not involve causality in a weak form.
   - **False Universals (<FU>):** This involves asserting universally agreed points without proof. The statement does not do this.
   - **Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>):** This involves using statements open to dual interpretations. The statement is not open to dual interpretations.

4. **Match to the Most Appropriate Type:**
   - The given argument does not expand beyond rephrasing the proposition. It reiterates that smoking cigarettes is deadly by stating that they can kill you, which does not provide new information or reason.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Based on the analysis, the statement "smoking cigarettes is deadly because cigarettes can kill you" is best classified under **<RR> (Redundant Reason)** because it repeats the same idea using different words without adding new information or a logical reinforcement.

Therefore, the classification of the string "smoking cigarettes is deadly because cigarettes can kill you" is **<RR> (Redundant Reason)**.
