For 
To apply <IDAA> — the task of decomposing and classifying a given argument as one of several predefined defective argument types — to the statement "Get Verizon--1 billion people can't be wrong," we will break down and systematically analyze the statement step by step.

### Step-by-Step Process for Applying <IDAA>:

1. **Identify the Proposition and the Reasoning**:
   - **Proposition**: The statement implies you should choose Verizon.
   - **Reasoning**: It argues that because 1 billion people use Verizon, it must be the right choice.

2. **Evaluate the Type of Reasoning**:
   - Determine the kind of logic or argument used to support the proposition.
   - The reasoning rests on the popularity of Verizon as a validation for its choice.

3. **Compare it Against Defined Defective Argument Types**:
   - **Generalization (<G>)**: This type involves making a general claim based on a specific instance.
     - Not applicable here, as the statement is based on widespread popularity, not an isolated instance.
   - **False Enumeration (<FE>)**: This involves listing fewer or more options than actually exist.
     - Not relevant; there are no enumerated options presented in the argument.
   - **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>)**: This involves providing a reason that doesn't logically support the proposition.
     - The statement provides an argument based on a fact (popularity), albeit potentially flawed.
   - **Redundant Reason (<RR>)**: This involves repeating the proposition with different words.
     - Not applicable as the reasoning isn’t redundant.
   - **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: This involves offering a causal relationship that is weak.
     - Popularity does suggest credibility but does not logically verify quality or suitability for everyone.
   - **False Universals (<FU>)**: This asserts universally agreed points without proof, appealing to popularity.
     - Relevant, as it uses the fact that many people use Verizon to assert it is the best choice without actual evidence beyond popularity.
   - **Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>)**: This involves statements open to dual interpretations.
     - Not applicable since there is no ambiguity or dual meaning here.

### Step 4: Determine the Best Match
Among the possible types, the statement most closely matches:

- **<FU> (False Universals)**: The argument leverages the purported universal validation of popularity (1 billion users) as proof of Verizon being the best choice, without actual substantive evidence. This is a classic appeal to popularity.

### Conclusion:
The statement "Get Verizon--1 billion people can't be wrong" is best classified under the defective argument type:

**<FU> - False Universals**

Thus, the rigorous application of <IDAA> results in the conclusion that the argument relies on a False Universal, using popularity as an implicit proof of validity.
