For 
To apply <IDAA> to the task of classifying the argument "That restaurant is popular because everyone in town goes there," we will follow a structured approach:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition of <IDA> into Specific Steps (D)

### Step 1: Understand the Structure and Claim
- **Proposition:** "That restaurant is popular."
- **Reason Provided:** "Because everyone in town goes there."

### Step 2: Identify and Define Defective Argument Types
1. **Generalization (<G>)**: Claims a general truth based on a specific instance.
2. **False Enumeration (<FE>)**: Lists fewer or more options than actually exist.
3. **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>)**: Provides a reason that doesn't logically support the proposition.
4. **Redundant Reason (<RR>)**: Repeats the proposition using different words.
5. **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: Offers a causal basis that is not compelling enough to support the proposition.
6. **False Universals (<FU>)**: Asserts universally agreed points without proof.
7. **Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>)**: Uses statements open to dual interpretations, potentially against the speaker.

### Step 3: Compare the Argument with Each Defective Argument Type

Let's analyze the reasoning provided:

- **Generalization (<G>):**
  - This does not fit, as the statement does not generalize a wider truth from a specific instance.

- **False Enumeration (<FE>):**
  - The statement does not involve listing options, so this type does not apply.

- **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>):**
  - The reason given ("everyone in town goes there") is directly related to the claim ("the restaurant is popular"). 

- **Redundant Reason (<RR>):**
  - This does not fit, as the reason isnâ€™t restating the proposition in different words entirely.

- **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>):**
  - The statement doesn't imply a weak causation but rather focuses on a reason directly.

- **False Universals (<FU>):**
  - This type does apply, as asserting that the restaurant is popular because everyone goes there is relying on the universal fact of popularity due to attendance without addressing other aspects.

- **Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>):**
  - This does not fit, as there is no dual interpretation against the speaker.

### Step 4: Classify the Argument

The most fitting defective argument type for the given argument is:
- **False Universals (<FU>)**: The reasoning relies on the universal idea that something is popular solely because it is frequented by many people, without addressing other potential explanatory factors such as the quality of food, service, etc.

### Conclusion
The argument "That restaurant is popular because everyone in town goes there" is best classified as type **<FU> (False Universals)**.

### Final Classification:
**<FU> (False Universals)**
Type of Defective Argument for 'That restaurant is popular because everyone in town goes there': <FU>
