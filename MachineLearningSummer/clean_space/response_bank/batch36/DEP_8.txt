For 
To apply \(<IDAA>\) to the statement "Science shows us that improved quality of life comes through research and invention," we need to decompose the task of classifying the argument type into specific steps. Here’s the step-by-step breakdown:

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition
- **Proposition:** Improved quality of life comes through research and invention.
- **Reasoning or Support Provided:** Science shows us this.

### Step 2: Analyze the Reasoning
- Evaluate if the reasoning or support provided logically supports the proposition.

### Step 3: Compare with Definitions of Defective Argument Types
- **Generalization (<G>):** Claiming a general truth based on a specific instance.
  - **Analysis:** This statement does not make a general claim from a specific instance.
  
- **False Enumeration (<FE>):** Listing fewer or more options than actually exist.
  - **Analysis:** This statement does not enumerate options.
  
- **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>):** Providing a reason that doesn’t logically support the proposition.
  - **Analysis:** The phrase "Science shows us" implies that there is scientific evidence to support the claim, which seems to be a relevant reason.
  
- **Redundant Reason (<RR>):** Presenting the same reason as the proposition in different words.
  - **Analysis:** The statement isn’t simply restating the proposition.
  
- **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>):** Offering a causal basis that is not compelling enough to support the proposition.
  - **Analysis:** The link between research, invention, and improved quality of life can be supported by many scientific studies, so it doesn't seem to be a weak causal basis.
  
- **False Universals (<FU>):** Asserting universally agreed points without proof.
  - **Analysis:** This statement does not assert universally agreed points, it claims scientific support.
  
- **Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>):** Using statements open to dual interpretations that might contradict the speaker.
  - **Analysis:** The statement is straightforward and does not have dual interpretations.

### Step 4: Verify and Conclude
After analyzing, we see that none of the predefined defective argument types (G, FE, IR, RR, WCB, FU, DEP) fit perfectly. The given statement appears logically sound if indeed there is scientific support for the claim. However, we need to ensure that “science shows us” is not being misused to make a vague or overstated claim without solid backing.

If “science shows us” is used more as an appeal to authority without proper evidence, it might border on a fallacy traditionally known as the “Appeal to Authority.” However, this fallacy isn’t explicitly defined in our list of defective argument types.

### Final Conclusion
- Without more context or evidence showing that the phrase “science shows us” is misused or unsupported, it doesn’t fit neatly into one of the predefined defective argument types. Based on the standard definitions provided, the argument does not exhibit any standard defective reasoning from the list.

Thus, with the current information, the given statement "Science shows us that improved quality of life comes through research and invention" does not classify under any of the given defective argument types (\(G, FE, IR, RR, WCB, FU, DEP\)).
