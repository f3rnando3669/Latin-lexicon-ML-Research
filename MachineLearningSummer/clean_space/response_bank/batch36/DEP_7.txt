For 
To apply <IDAA> to the statement "The police said they suspect several people of setting the fire. Therefore, I can't be under suspicion because I was alone all night," we need to follow a structured decompositional approach step by step:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition of <IDAA>:

#### Step 1: Identify the Parts of the Statement
- **Premise**: "The police said they suspect several people of setting the fire."
- **Conclusion**: "Therefore, I can't be under suspicion because I was alone all night."

#### Step 2: Analyze the Logical Structure
- The speaker is concluding that they cannot be suspected because the police suspect several people, and they were alone.
- The speaker is using the premise about multiple suspects to assert their own innocence based on being alone.

#### Step 3: Compare with Definitions of Defective Argument Types
The next step is to match the analysis against the definitions of the defective argument types: <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>.

1. **<G> Generalization**:
   - This involves claiming a general truth based on a specific instance. The statement does not generalize from specifics to a universal claim.

2. **<FE> False Enumeration**:
   - This involves listing fewer or more options than actually exist. While there's a consideration of multiple suspects, it doesn't falsely enumerate options directly.

3. **<IR> Inappropriate Reason**:
   - This involves providing a reason that doesn't logically support the proposition. The reasoning here is flawed because the number of suspects doesn’t preclude the speaker’s involvement.

4. **<RR> Redundant Reason**:
   - This involves repeating the same thing using different words. The statement isn’t just restating the claim redundantly but providing an argument.

5. **<WCB> Weak Causal Basis**:
   - This involves offering a weak causal link. The argument assumes only groups can be suspects without proper basis, which could be seen as weak causal reasoning.

6. **<FU> False Universals**:
   - This involves asserting universally agreed points without proof. The statement does not assert universally agreed points but uses a specific claim.

7. **<DEP> Double-Edged Phrases**:
   - This involves using statements open to dual interpretations. The statement does not contain phrases with dual interpretations.

#### Step 4: Determine the Most Appropriate Defective Argument Type

Based on the analysis:
- The argument provided is based on inappropriate reasoning because the presence of other suspects doesn’t logically exclude the possibility of the speaker being involved, even if they were alone.

### Conclusion
The argument that "The police said they suspect several people of setting the fire. Therefore, I can't be under suspicion because I was alone all night." fits best under:

**<IR> Inappropriate Reason**

The speaker’s reason ("being alone all night") does not logically affirm that they can't be under suspicion, especially when the police suspect multiple people which does not preclude individuals who were alone.

Thus, the classification of this argument type is **<IR> (Inappropriate Reason)**.
