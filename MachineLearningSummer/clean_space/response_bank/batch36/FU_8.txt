### Step-by-Step Decomposition for IDAA

#### Step 1: Understand the Argument
- **Claim**: "You should believe it."
- **Reason**: "Everyone believes it."

#### Step 2: Identify the Type of Logical Reasoning
- The statement suggests that because a majority (or everyone) believes something, it provides sufficient reason for the listener to believe it as well.

#### Step 3: Compare the Identified Reasoning with Defective Argument Types
We will classify the argument by comparing it against the provided defective argument types:

1. **Generalization (G)**: Claims a general truth based on a specific instance.
    - The argument does not generalize but relies on collective belief as a reason.

2. **False Enumeration (FE)**: Lists fewer or more options than actually exist.
    - The argument doesn’t enumerate options; it implies a singular course of action.

3. **Inappropriate Reason (IR)**: Provides a reason that doesn’t logically support the proposition.
    - The reason given (popularity) might not seem logically strong enough but may closely fit another category better.

4. **Redundant Reason (RR)**: Says the same thing as the proposition using different words.
    - The statement doesn’t redundantly restate the proposition; instead, it provides a separate supporting reason.

5. **Weak Causal Basis (WCB)**: Offers a causal basis that is not compelling enough to support the proposition.
    - The proposition is based on consensus rather than a causal connection.

6. **False Universals (FU)**: Asserts universally agreed points without proof.
    - The argument best matches this category as it relies on the notion that if a view is universally accepted, it must be true. This is classically known as an appeal to popularity (argumentum ad populum).

7. **Double-Edged Phrases (DEP)**: Uses statements open to dual interpretations, potentially against the speaker.
    - There is no ambiguity or dual interpretation present in the statement.

### Step 4: Classify the Argument
- Based on the analysis, the argument fits best with **<FU> (False Universals)** because it relies on the appeal to popularity or consensus to justify the acceptance of a belief.

### Conclusion
The argument "If everyone believes it, you should too!" is best classified as **<FU> (False Universals)**.

**Final Classification:** 
- **Type of Defective Argument:** <FU>
