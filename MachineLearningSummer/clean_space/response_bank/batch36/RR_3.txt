For 
To apply <IDAA> to the given exchange between Speaker 1 and Speaker 2, we need to decompose the task of classifying the argument into specific steps. Here's the step-by-step breakdown:

### Step 1: Identify the Statements and the Proposition
- **Speaker 1 (S1)** makes the initial claim: "Jesus was not really crucified."
- **Speaker 2 (S2)** questions the truth of the claim: "How do I know that’s true?"
- **S1** provides the reason for the claim: "Because the Quran says so."
- **S2** questions the reliability of the Quran: "How do I know the Quran is correct?"
- **S1** provides a reason: "Because the Quran is the Word of God, and everything it says is true."
- **S2** questions the truth of this assertion: "How do I know that’s true?"
- **S1** circularly supports the assertion: "Because God tells us so, here in the Koran."

### Step 2: Analyze the Reasoning
- The reasoning used repeatedly refers back to the Quran as the source of truth without providing external evidence.
- The argument is circular, as it uses the Quran to prove itself.

### Step 3: Compare with Defined Defective Argument Types
Let’s match the reasoning against the known defective argument types:

1. **Generalization (G):**
   - Not applicable here as no generalization from instances is made.

2. **False Enumeration (FE):**
   - Not applicable as no limited set of options is presented.

3. **Inappropriate Reason (IR):**
   - Partially applicable since the provided reasons do not independently support the proposition, but this is due to the circular reasoning instead of an unrelated reason.

4. **Redundant Reason (RR):**
   - Not directly applicable. Redundancy implies rephrasing the initial proposition without adding new information.

5. **Weak Causal Basis (WCB):**
   - Not applicable since this isn’t about insufficient causal links but rather about how evidence is used.

6. **False Universals (FU):**
   - Not applicable as the argument isn’t asserting universally agreed points.

7. **Double-Edged Phrases (DEP):**
   - Not applicable as no ambiguous phrases with dual interpretations are involved.

### Step 4: Classify Based On Analysis 
- The core issue is that the argument uses the Quran to prove itself instead of independent evidence, constituting a form of circular reasoning.
- While our predefined defective argument types don't explicitly cover circular reasoning, **Inappropriate Reason (IR)** fits under the broad category where reasons do not logically support the claim.

### Step 5: Conclusion
The argument shows that the Quran is claimed as proof of Jesus' non-crucifixion and the Quran's truth is justified only by itself without independent validation.

Therefore, the argument in the dialogue:
```
Speaker 1: Jesus was not really crucified.
Speaker 2: How do I know that’s true?
Speaker 1: Because the Quran says so.
Speaker 2: How do I know the Quran is correct?
Speaker 1: Because the Quran is the Word of God, and everything it says is true.
Speaker 2: How do I know that’s true?
Speaker 1: Because God tells us so, here in the Quran.
```
is best classified as **<IR> (Inappropriate Reason)** due to the circular reasoning inherent in the argument.

### Final Answer:
Type of Defective Argument for 'Speaker 1: Jesus was not really crucified.
Speaker 2: How do I know that’s true?
Speaker 1: Because the Quran says so.
Speaker 2: How do I know the Quran is correct?
Speaker 1: Because the Quran is the Word of God, and everything it says is true.
Speaker 2: How do I know that’s true?
Speaker 1: Because God tells us so, here in the Quran.': <IR>
