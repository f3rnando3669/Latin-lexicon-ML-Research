For 
To apply <IDAA> to classify the statement "If we allow Susan to leave early, soon we'll be giving everyone Friday afternoon off," we need to decompose the classification task into specific steps and then execute those steps.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition of <IDA>:

1. **Identify the Proposition and Reasoning**:
    - **Proposition**: The underlying claim is that allowing Susan to leave early will lead to a broader, undesirable outcome.
    - **Reasoning**: Allowing a single exception sets a precedent that will require allowing everyone similar privileges, leading to Friday afternoon off for all.

2. **Determine the Logical Structure**:
    - The argument suggests a slippery slope where one small allowance (letting Susan leave early) will inevitably lead to a larger, less desirable concession.

3. **Match Argument to Definitions of Defective Argument Types**:
    - **Generalization (<G>)**: Claims a general truth based on a specific instance.
    - **False Enumeration (<FE>)**: Lists fewer or more options than actually exist.
    - **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>)**: Provides a reason that does not logically support the proposition.
    - **Redundant Reason (<RR>)**: Repeats the proposition using different words without adding information.
    - **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: Offers a non-compelling causal link to support the proposition.
    - **False Universals (<FU>)**: Asserts universally agreed points without proof.
    - **Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>)**: Uses statements open to dual interpretations, potentially against the speaker.

4. **Evaluate each Defective Argument Type**:
    a. **Generalization (<G>)**:
        - The argument is not making a broad generalization based on a specific instance.
    b. **False Enumeration (<FE>)**:
        - The argument does not involve listing options.
    c. **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>)**:
        - The logic implies a slippery slope rather than an inappropriate reason.
    d. **Redundant Reason (<RR>)**:
        - The argument does not merely restate the proposition.
    e. **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>)**:
        - Yes, the causal link provided is weak and speculative. The argument assumes one small act of leniency will lead to a significant policy change without providing strong evidence.
    f. **False Universals (<FU>)**:
        - The argument does not claim universally agreed points.
    g. **Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>)**:
        - No dual interpretation is present in the argument.

5. **Most Suitable Defective Argument Type**:
    - The argument's primary flaw is assuming a weak causal link ("allowing Susan to leave early" will cause "giving everyone Friday afternoon off") without sufficient evidence to support this chain of events.

### Conclusion:

The argument "If we allow Susan to leave early, soon we'll be giving everyone Friday afternoon off" fits best under the defective argument type:

**<WCB> (Weak Causal Basis)**

**Final Classification:**
The string is of type **<WCB>** because it presents a weak causal link without adequate support to justify the claimed conclusion.
