What fallacy has she committed?", " Perhaps the most classic example of this fallacy is the argument for the existence of God.  Due to the understanding of nature through science, many of the arguments that used to be used for God (or gods) were abandoned, only to be replaced with new ones, usually involving questions to which science has not definitively answered yet.  The move from creationism to intelligent design is a prime example.  Currently the origin of life is a popular argument for God (although a classic argument from ignorance), and an area where we very well may have a scientific answer in the next decade, at which time, the \u201corigin of life\u201d argument will fade away and be replaced by another, thus moving the figurative goalposts farther back as our understanding of the natural world increases.Exception: This fallacy should not be confused with an argument or set of arguments, with multiple propositions inherent in the argument.  The reason for the difference between this kind of argument and the moving the goalposts fallacy, is a subtle one, but indicated by a strong initial claim (\u201chas to be\u201d, \u201cmust\u201d, \u201crequired for\u201d, etc.) that gets answered and/or what appears to be ad hoc objections that follow eventually leading to an impossible request for proof.\r\nFun Fact: The name \u201cmoving the goalposts\u201d comes from the analogy of kicking a perfect field goal in American football, only to have the goalposts be moved on you. This would be very unfair.\r\nReferences:\r\nThis a logical fallacy frequently used on the Internet. No academic sources could be found.\r\nQuestions about this fallacy?
