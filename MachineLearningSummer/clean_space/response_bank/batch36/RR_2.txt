For 
To apply <IDAA>—the process of decomposing the task of classifying a string into specific steps—to the given statement "We need to fix our broken judicial system by electing new people," let's break it down step by step:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition:

1. **Identify the Proposition and Reasoning:**
   - **Proposition:** We need to fix our broken judicial system.
   - **Reasoning:** By electing new people.

2. **Analyze the Reason Provided for Logical Validity:**
   - Assess whether the provided reasoning (electing new people) logically and adequately supports the proposition (fixing the judicial system).

3. **Compare the Reason Against Known Defective Argument Types:**

   **a. Generalization (<G>):**
   - **Description:** Claims a general truth based on a specific instance.
   - **Analysis:** This argument does not generalize from specific instances.

   **b. False Enumeration (<FE>):**
   - **Description:** Lists fewer or more options than actually exist.
   - **Analysis:** The argument does not create a false dichotomy or limited choice.

   **c. Inappropriate Reason (<IR>):**
   - **Description:** Provides a reason that doesn’t logically support the proposition.
   - **Analysis:** The reasoning that electing new people will fix the judicial system might be seen as an inappropriate reason because merely bringing in new people does not guarantee systemic reform or address structural issues in the judicial system.

   **d. Redundant Reason (<RR>):**
   - **Description:** A reason that says the same thing as the proposition using different words.
   - **Analysis:** The statement does not redundantly restate its proposition.

   **e. Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>):**
   - **Description:** Offers a causal basis that is not compelling enough to support the proposition.
   - **Analysis:** The argument does not establish a compelling causal relationship between electing new people and fixing the judicial system.

   **f. False Universals (<FU>):**
   - **Description:** Asserts universally agreed points without proof.
   - **Analysis:** The statement does not assert universal agreements.

   **g. Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>):**
   - **Description:** Uses statements open to dual interpretations, potentially against the speaker.
   - **Analysis:** The argument is not constructed with dual-meaning phrases.

### Step 4: Conclusion Based on Analysis
   - **Most fitting category:** Inappropriate Reason (**<IR>**)
   - **Reason**: Electing new people does not inherently ensure the judicial system will be fixed, thus the reasoning for the proposition is not logically sound or sufficient.

### Final Classification: 

The defective argument type for the statement "We need to fix our broken judicial system by electing new people" is **<IR> Inappropriate Reason**.

### Summary:

By identifying the main argument, analyzing the provided reasoning, comparing it against known defective argument types, and concluding based on logical analysis, we have classified the argument as **<IR> Inappropriate Reason**.
