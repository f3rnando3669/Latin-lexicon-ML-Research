For 
To apply <IDAA> to classify the string "See the movie that everybody's talking about," we will break down the classification task step-by-step.

### Decompose the Task (<D>):

1. **Identify the Proposition and Reasoning:**
   - **Proposition:** "See the movie."
   - **Reasoning:** "Everybody's talking about it."

2. **Determine the Logical Structure:**
   - The argument is using the fact that "everybody is talking about the movie" as a reason why you should see it.

3. **Compare Against Defective Argument Types:**
   - **<G> (Generalization):** Claims a general truth based on a specific instance.
   - **<FE> (False Enumeration):** Lists fewer or more options than actually exist.
   - **<IR> (Inappropriate Reason):** Provides a reason that doesnâ€™t logically support the proposition.
   - **<RR> (Redundant Reason):** A reason that says the same thing as the proposition using different words.
   - **<WCB> (Weak Causal Basis):** Offers a causal basis that is not compelling enough to support the proposition.
   - **<FU> (False Universals):** Asserts universally agreed points without proof.
   - **<DEP> (Double-Edged Phrases):** Uses statements open to dual interpretations.

4. **Evaluate for Fit:**
   - **<G>:** The argument does not make a general claim based on a specific instance.
   - **<FE>:** The argument does not list options.
   - **<IR>:** The reasoning is directly related to the proposition, suggesting popularity is influencing the recommendation.
   - **<RR>:** The argument is not simply a restatement.
   - **<WCB>:** The argument does not provide a causal link but focuses on social influence.
   - **<FU>:** The argument asserts that because many people are talking about the movie, it must be worth seeing. This is an appeal to popularity/common belief.
   - **<DEP>:** The argument is not using dual interpretations.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The statement fits best under **<FU> (False Universals)** because it relies on the popularity of the movie as the sole reason for its recommendation. It uses social validation without providing actual proof of the movie's quality or why it should be seen.

### Final Classification:

The string "See the movie that everybody's talking about" is classified as:

### <FU> (False Universals)

Type of Defective Argument for 'See the movie that everybody's talking about': <FU>
