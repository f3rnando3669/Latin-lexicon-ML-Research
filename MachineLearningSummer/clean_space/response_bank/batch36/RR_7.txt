Let's apply the method of <IDAA> to classify the string according to the types of defective arguments defined. The task <IDA> involves identifying and classifying the argument type given in the interaction between the two speakers.

### Step-by-Step Application of <IDAA>

1. **Identify the Argument and Reasoning:**
   - **Speaker 1’s Proposition:** "You should trust the Bible because it’s the Word of God."
   - **Supporting Reason:** "Because God tells us it is."
   - **Evidence:** "Right here, in the Bible."

2. **Analyze the Argument Structure:**
   - The argument presented by Speaker 1 relies on a circular reasoning pattern. Speaker 1 asserts the Bible is the Word of God because the Bible says so.
   - The reason provided is "because God tells us it is," which is backed up by the evidence in the Bible itself.

3. **Determine Logical Fallacy or Defective Argument Type:**
   - **Generalization (G):** Does not involve generalization from a specific instance.
   - **False Enumeration (FE):** Does not involve presenting a limited or excessive number of options.
   - **Inappropriate Reason (IR):** Could involve using a reason that doesn't logically support the proposition, but there is no irrelevant reason used here.
   - **Redundant Reason (RR):** Involves presenting the same reason using different words.
   - **Weak Causal Basis (WCB):** Not based on a weak causal link.
   - **False Universals (FU):** Does not assert universally agreed points without proof.
   - **Double-Edged Phrases (DEP):** Does not use statements open to dual interpretations.

4. **Identify the Classification:**
   - The argument essentially repeats the claim using different words without providing new information. Here, the reason “because God tells us it is” and the evidence “right here, in the Bible” together form a circular argument that does not move beyond the initial claim.

### Conclusion:

Given that the argument relies on circular reasoning, the best fit is:
- **<RR> Redundant Reason:** The argument presents a reason that essentially says the same thing as the proposition using different words, and this redundancy is what leads to the circular argument.

Therefore, the given interaction:
```
Speaker 1: You should trust the Bible because it’s the Word of God.
Speaker 2: How do you know it’s the Word of God?
Speaker 1: Because God tells us it is.
Speaker 2: Where does God tell us this?
Speaker 1: Right here, in the Bible.
```
is an example of <RR> Redundant Reason.
