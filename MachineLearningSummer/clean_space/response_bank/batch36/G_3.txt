For 
To apply <IDAA> to the argument "One of our clients doubled their conversions after changing all their landing page text to bright red. Therefore, changing all text to red is a proven way to double conversions.", let's break down this classification task step by step.

### Step-by-Step Process for <IDAA>:

1. **Identify the Core Proposition and Reasoning**:
   - **Proposition**: Changing all text to red is a proven way to double conversions.
   - **Reasoning**: One of our clients doubled their conversions after changing all their landing page text to bright red.

2. **Analyze the Reasoning Provided**:
   - The argument claims a general truth (doubling conversions by changing text color) based on the experience of a single client.

3. **Match the Reasoning Against the Possible Defective Argument Types**:
   - **<G> Generalization**: Claims a general truth based on a specific instance.
   - **<FE> False Enumeration**: Does not involve listing options.
   - **<IR> Inappropriate Reason**: The reason given (client's experience) is relevant but not conclusive.
   - **<RR> Redundant Reason**: The argument is not merely repeating itself.
   - **<WCB> Weak Causal Basis**: Suggests a weak causal relationship between changing text color and doubling conversions.
   - **<FU> False Universals**: Not applicable as it doesn't rely on universal agreement.
   - **<DEP> Double-Edged Phrases**: No dual interpretation here.

4. **Classify the Argument**:
   - The argument fits both **<G> Generalization** and **<WCB> Weak Causal Basis**:
     - **<G> Generalization**: The argument generalizes a broad conclusion from a single instance.
     - **<WCB> Weak Causal Basis**: The argument implies a weak cause-and-effect relationship without sufficient evidence.

5. **Determine the Primary Defective Argument Type**:
   - While there is a weak causal implication, the primary fault lies in generalizing results from a single instance to a universal truth.

### Conclusion:
The argument primarily represents a **<G> Generalization** as it extrapolates a specific instance to a broader, unsupported conclusion.

Thus, applying <IDAA> to the statement "One of our clients doubled their conversions after changing all their landing page text to bright red. Therefore, changing all text to red is a proven way to double conversions." results in the classification:

**Type of Defective Argument: <G> Generalization**.
