For 
To apply <IDAA> to the argument "All my friends are doing a low carb diet. That must be the only way to lose weight so I will do it too," we will follow a structured approach, breaking down the task into specific steps.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition of <IDAA>:

1. **Identify the Argument and its Components:**
    - Proposition: "That must be the only way to lose weight."
    - Reason: "All my friends are doing a low carb diet."

2. **Analyze the Logical Structure:**
    - The statement makes a causative inference based on the observation that friends are following a low carb diet.
    - The conclusion drawn is that because friends are doing it, it must be the definitive method for losing weight.

3. **Match the Argument to the Definitions of Known Defective Argument Types:**
    - **Generalization (<G>):** Claiming a general truth based on a specific instance.
    - **False Enumeration (<FE>):** Listing fewer or more options than actually exist.
    - **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>):** Providing a reason that doesn't logically support the proposition.
    - **Redundant Reason (<RR>):** Reason that simply restates the proposition.
    - **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>):** Offering a causal basis that is not compelling enough.
    - **False Universals (<FU>):** Asserting universally agreed points without proof.
    - **Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>):** Using statements open to dual interpretations.

4. **Evaluate Each Type:**

    - **Generalization (<G>):** Claiming a broad truth from a specific instance. In this case, extending the observation (friends doing a diet) to a universal truth (only way to lose weight).
  
    - **False Enumeration (<FE>):** Not applicable since it doesn't enumerate limited options, but rather makes an assertion of superiority of one specific method.
  
    - **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>):** This isn't purely "inappropriate," but rather based on observation leading to generalization.
  
    - **Redundant Reason (<RR>):** There is no repetitive restatement.
  
    - **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>):** There is an implicit weak causal assertion that friends' choice indicates the success of the diet, but the flaw is more in unwarranted generalization.

    - **False Universals (<FU>):** The argument rests heavily on the idea that because the friends are doing it, it must be universally correct without providing actual universal evidence.
  
    - **Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>):** This lacks ambiguity or dual interpretation.

### Conclusion Based on Analysis:

- **Primary Match:** <FU> (False Universals)
- **Reason:** The statement asserts that because the friends are following the diet, it must be the only effective way to lose weight, appealing to popularity without substantial evidence.

By breaking down and evaluating the argument step by step, the classification for the statement "All my friends are doing a low carb diet. That must be the only way to lose weight so I will do it too" is confirmed as **<FU> False Universals**.

Classification: **<FU> False Universals**
