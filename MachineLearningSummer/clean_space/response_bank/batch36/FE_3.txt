For 
To apply <IDAA> to the given string "People either like coffee or hate it," we need to decompose the task of classifying this argument into specific steps. Here's a structured approach:

### Decomposition of the Task (D)
1. **Identify and Understand the Statement**:
   - Break down the statement to understand its structure and meaning.
   
2. **Check for Generalization (<G>)**:
   - Determine if the statement is claiming a general truth based on a specific instance.
   
3. **Check for False Enumeration (<FE>)**:
   - Determine if the statement lists fewer or more options than actually exist.
   
4. **Check for Inappropriate Reason (<IR>)**:
   - Determine if the provided reason doesn't logically support the proposition.
   
5. **Check for Redundant Reason (<RR>)**:
   - Determine if the statement is redundant, appearing to say the same thing as the proposition using different words.
   
6. **Check for Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>)**:
   - Determine if the statement offers a causal basis that is not compelling enough to support the proposition.
   
7. **Check for False Universals (<FU>)**:
   - Determine if the statement asserts universally agreed points without proof.
   
8. **Check for Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>)**:
   - Determine if the statement uses phrases open to dual interpretations, potentially against the speaker.

### Application of Decomposition to Classification (IDAA):

1. **Identify and Understand the Statement**:
   - Statement: "People either like coffee or hate it."
   - The statement is categorizing people's attitudes towards coffee into two distinct and mutually exclusive groups.

2. **Check for Generalization (<G>)**:
   - The statement is not claiming a general truth based on a specific instance. It is making a sweeping generalization but not from a specific instance.

3. **Check for False Enumeration (<FE>)**:
   - The statement presents two options: liking coffee and hating coffee. It does not account for neutrality or indifference. This is a classic example of presenting fewer options than exist. 
   - **Classification: <FE>**

4. **Check for Inappropriate Reason (<IR>)**:
   - There is no reason provided in the statement, so this does not apply.

5. **Check for Redundant Reason (<RR>)**:
   - There is no redundancy present in the statement.

6. **Check for Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>)**:
   - There is no causal basis needed or provided in this statement, so this does not apply.

7. **Check for False Universals (<FU>)**:
   - While it is making an assertion that might seem universal, the classification of presenting fewer options is more strongly applicable.
   
8. **Check for Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>)**:
   - There are no double-edged phrases or dual interpretations present in the statement.

### Conclusion:
The statement "People either like coffee or hate it." is best classified as **<FE> (False Enumeration)** because it lists fewer options (people's attitudes towards coffee) than actually exist.

### Summary:
1. Identify and understand the statement.
2. Check for various types of defective arguments <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>.
3. Match the best fit to the statement.
4. Conclude the classification.

By following these steps, we've classified the argument under <FE> (False Enumeration).
Type of Defective Argument for 'People either like coffee or hate it.': <FE>
