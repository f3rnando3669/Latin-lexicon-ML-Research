For 
To apply <IDAA> (the decomposition of the task of classifying a string as of type <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>) to the sentence "You are either with God or against him," we need to break down the task into specific steps and execute each step to identify the defective argument type.

### Step-by-Step Application:

### Step 1: Identify the Statement Type and Structure
- **Statement:** "You are either with God or against him."
- **Structure:** This statement is presenting a dichotomy, suggesting only two possible positions regarding one's stance on God.

### Step 2: Compare with Defective Arguments
1. **Generalization (G):** 
   - This type makes a broad claim based on a specific instance.
   - **Check:** The statement is not generalizing based on a specific instance.

2. **False Enumeration (FE):**
   - This involves listing fewer or more options than actually exist.
   - **Check:** The statement does exactly this by presenting only two options (with God or against him) when, in reality, there may be more nuanced positions.

3. **Inappropriate Reason (IR):**
   - This type provides a reason that doesn't logically support the proposition.
   - **Check:** The statement is not providing a reason, just presenting an ultimatum.

4. **Redundant Reason (RR):**
   - This involves restating the same thing as the proposition using different words.
   - **Check:** The statement is not repeating the same proposition.

5. **Weak Causal Basis (WCB):**
   - This involves a weak causal link.
   - **Check:** The statement does not present a causal relationship.

6. **False Universals (FU):**
   - This asserts universally agreed points without proof.
   - **Check:** The statement doesnâ€™t fall under this category directly, although it could indirectly touch upon universally forced views.

7. **Double-Edged Phrases (DEP):**
   - This involves using statements open to dual interpretations.
   - **Check:** The statement does not have dual interpretations.

### Step 3: Classify the Statement
- Based on the comparison:
  - **False Enumeration (FE)** is the most fitting category for the statement because it limits the choices to just two simplistic options, ignoring the complexities and other possibilities.

### Conclusion
The statement "You are either with God or against him" is an example of:
- **<FE> False Enumeration**

This logical fallacy is known for presenting fewer options than actually exist, forcing a binary choice when, in fact, there may be more nuanced or intermediate positions available.
Type of Defective Argument for 'You are either with God or against him.': <FE>
