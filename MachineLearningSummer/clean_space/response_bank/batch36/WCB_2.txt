For 
To apply <IDAA> (the decomposition of the task of classifying a defective argument type into specific steps) to "Farmer McDonald: Ever since they put up that new power plant across the river, we haven't had a bit of rain. I'm tellin' you, mankind has got too big for its britches when it fiddles around with nature." let's follow these steps:

### Step 1: Identify the Components of the Argument
Extract the main components from the statement to better understand the claim and the reasoning behind it.

1. **Observation**: "Ever since they put up that new power plant across the river, we haven't had a bit of rain."
2. **Conclusion**: "Mankind has got too big for its britches when it fiddles around with nature."

### Step 2: Examine the Logical Structure of the Argument
Determine if the observation logically supports the conclusion.

1. **Premise**: Building of the power plant.
2. **Observation**: Lack of rain.
3. **Conclusion**: The power plant's construction results in the lack of rain, implying that human intervention in nature is the cause.

### Step 3: Compare Against Definitions of Defective Argument Types
Compare the identified reasoning with the predefined types of defective arguments.

1. **Generalization (<G>)**: 
   - Does it claim a general truth based on a specific instance?
   - This is not primarily making a general claim but is discussing a specific cause-and-effect scenario.

2. **False Enumeration (<FE>)**: 
   - Does it list fewer or more options than actually exist?
   - No, it’s not listing options.

3. **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>)**:
   - Does it provide a reason that doesn't logically support the proposition?
   - It does give a reason that might seem logically detached, but the main issue seems to be more about causation.

4. **Redundant Reason (<RR>)**: 
   - Does it present the same thing as the proposition using different words?
   - No, the reason is not redundant.

5. **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>)**:
   - Does it offer a causal basis that isn’t compelling enough?
   - Yes, it provides an anecdotal and loosely connected causal link between the power plant and the lack of rain without adequate scientific evidence.

6. **False Universals (<FU>)**: 
   - Does it assert universally agreed points without proof?
   - No, it’s not claiming universal agreement.

7. **Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>)**: 
   - Does it use statements open to dual interpretations?
   - No, it’s not ambiguous.

### Step 4: Classify the Argument Type
Based on the analysis, the most fitting classification for the argument is:

- **<WCB> (Weak Causal Basis)**: It makes a causal claim (new power plant resulting in no rain) that is not compelling enough to support the conclusion.

### Conclusion
The statement "Ever since they put up that new power plant across the river, we haven't had a bit of rain. I'm tellin' you, mankind has got too big for its britches when it fiddles around with nature." is best classified under **<WCB>** (Weak Causal Basis).

Thus, according to <IDAA>, the string falls under the defective argument type **<WCB>**.
