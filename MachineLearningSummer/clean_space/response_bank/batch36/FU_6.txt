For 
To apply <IDAA> — the approach of systematically breaking down the task of classifying a defective argument type — to the string "Everybody else is doing it, why don't you?", we need to follow a structured process. Let's decompose it step by step.

### Step 1: Understand the Argument
- **Proposition**: You should do it.
- **Reason**: Everybody else is doing it.

### Step 2: Define Defective Argument Types
We will be comparing the argument against the following defective argument types:
1. **<G> Generalization**: Claiming a general truth based on a specific instance.
2. **<FE> False Enumeration**: Listing fewer or more options than actually exist.
3. **<IR> Inappropriate Reason**: Providing a reason that doesn't logically support the proposition.
4. **<RR> Redundant Reason**: Saying the same thing as the proposition using different words.
5. **<WCB> Weak Causal Basis**: Offering a causal basis that is not compelling enough to support the proposition.
6. **<FU> False Universals**: Asserting universally agreed points without proof.
7. **<DEP> Double-Edged Phrases**: Using statements open to dual interpretations, potentially against the speaker.

### Step 3: Analyze the Argument
- The argument attempts to convince someone to do something because others are doing it.
- This relies on the popularity or commonality of the action as the justification for doing it. 

### Step 4: Match Against Definitions

1. **<G> Generalization**:
   - This argument does not make a sweeping claim based on a specific instance. **Not applicable.**

2. **<FE> False Enumeration**:
   - The argument does not present limited or excessive choices, but rather encourages an action based on others doing it. **Not applicable.**

3. **<IR> Inappropriate Reason**:
   - The reason may seem related but is logically weak. However, it appeals more to social conformity than logical inconsistency in disconnect. **Partially applicable but not the best fit.**

4. **<RR> Redundant Reason**:
   - No redundancy here as the reason is distinct from the proposition. **Not applicable.**

5. **<WCB> Weak Causal Basis**:
   - There is no causal relationship suggested in this argument. **Not applicable.**

6. **<FU> False Universals**:
   - It asserts the point that because "everybody else is doing it," you should too, appealing to popularity or social proof as validation. This closely matches the notion of universally agreed points without proof. **Best fit.**

7. **<DEP> Double-Edged Phrases**:
   - No dual interpretation that can backfire is present. **Not applicable.**

### Step 5: Conclusion
By evaluating the argument based on these criteria, the best classification is:

- **<FU> False Universals**: The argument relies on the appeal to the popularity of the action without any substantial proof that the popularity validates the action as the correct decision.

### Final Classification
Type of Defective Argument for `Everybody else is doing it, why don't you?`: **<FU> False Universals**
