Sure! Let's apply <IDAA> to classify the argument type of the statement: "Officer, I was only driving as fast as everyone around me. I'm sure I wasn't speeding."

### Step-by-Step Decomposition and Application:

### Step 1: Understand the Argument

Identify the main components of the argument.
- **Claim:** "I wasn't speeding."
- **Reason Provided:** "I was only driving as fast as everyone around me."

### Step 2: List Possible Defective Argument Types

Recall the predefined defective argument types:
- **<G> Generalization**: Claims a general truth based on a specific instance.
- **<FE> False Enumeration**: Lists fewer or more options than actually exist.
- **<IR> Inappropriate Reason**: Provides a reason that doesnâ€™t logically support the proposition.
- **<RR> Redundant Reason**: A reason that says the same thing as the proposition using different words.
- **<WCB> Weak Causal Basis**: Offers a causal basis that is not compelling enough to support the proposition.
- **<FU> False Universals**: Asserts universally agreed points without proof.
- **<DEP> Double-Edged Phrases**: Uses statements open to dual interpretations, potentially against the speaker.

### Step 3: Analyze the Reason Provided

Determine if the reason logically supports the claim.
- The driver claims he wasn't speeding because he was driving at the same speed as those around him.

### Step 4: Compare With Definitions

Compare the argument against the definitions of each defective argument type:

1. **<G>: Generalization**
   - This does not generalize a broader truth from a specific instance.

2. **<FE>: False Enumeration**
   - This does not enumerate limited choices.

3. **<IR>: Inappropriate Reason**
   - The reason "everyone around me was driving at the same speed" does not logically prove that the driver wasn't speeding (even if others are speeding, the driver could still be speeding). This fits the <IR> type.

4. **<RR>: Redundant Reason**
   - The argument does not redundantly restate the proposition.

5. **<WCB>: Weak Causal Basis**
   - There's no weak causal connection here.

6. **<FU>: False Universals**
   - This is not about universally agreed points without proof.

7. **<DEP>: Double-Edged Phrases**
   - There is no dual interpretation in a humorous or ironic sense.

### Step 5: Conclude Classification

The argument primarily relies on providing an **Inappropriate Reason** to justify the claim. The reasoning that "everyone else was doing it" does not logically support the claim that the driver wasn't breaking the speed limit.

### Conclusion

The statement: "Officer, I was only driving as fast as everyone around me. I'm sure I wasn't speeding." falls under:
- **<IR> (Inappropriate Reason)**

This classification shows that the reason provided does not logically support the proposition.
