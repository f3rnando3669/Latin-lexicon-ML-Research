For 
To apply <IDAA> to the argument "It is immoral to kill an innocent human being. Fetuses are innocent human beings. Therefore, it is immoral to kill fetuses." let's decompose and analyze the classification task step by step:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition of <IDA>:

1. **Identify the Proposition and Reasoning:**
    - **Proposition:** "It is immoral to kill fetuses."
    - **Reasoning:**
        - Premise 1: "It is immoral to kill an innocent human being."
        - Premise 2: "Fetuses are innocent human beings."

2. **Analyze the Logical Structure:**
    - The argument is using a syllogistic structure, linking the general moral principle with a specific category (fetuses).

3. **Check for Logical Inconsistencies or Defective Argument Types:**
    - Compare the argument against the definitions of the defective argument types: <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, and <DEP>.

### Comparison with Defective Argument Types:

**<G> Generalization:**
    - The argument does not seem to generalize from a specific instance to a broad claim.

**<FE> False Enumeration:**
    - The argument is not listing fewer or more options than actually exist.

**<IR> Inappropriate Reason:**
    - The reason given is not specifically irrelevant; it fits within the logical chain but needs further examination.

**<RR> Redundant Reason:**
    - The reason given is not simply restating the proposition.

**<WCB> Weak Causal Basis:**
    - The argument does not provide a weak causal link.

**<FU> False Universals:**
    - The argument does not seem to assert universally agreed points without proof explicitly.

**<DEP> Double-Edged Phrases:**
    - The argument does not use statements open to dual interpretations.

### Evaluation Based on Reason and Logic:

The argument strongly relies on the logical structure of a syllogism:
1. It's a classical deductive argument form.
2. It does not directly fit any of the provided defective argument types.

However, to rigorously check further under traditional logic:

- The argument could be contested based on the definition and applicability of terms like "innocent human beings" and whether fetuses unequivocally fall under this category as assumed in the premises.

**Further Analysis for Logical Fallacies:**

- If the premises are accepted as true, the conclusion logically follows. The main controversy centers on the definition's acceptance genially of "innocent human beings" applied universally.

### Conclusion:

Based on the provided definitions and the structure of the argument, it does not clearly fit into any of the predefined defective argument types. The logical structure itself follows deductive reasoning correctly if premises are agreed upon.

**Final Classification: None of the provided defective argument types apply directly.**

If further detail were to be considered, debate remains on the premise's acceptance societal and definition. However, strictly following predefined defective argument patterns, it remains outside.

### Final Response:

After a rigorous decomposition process analysis, the statement "It is immoral to kill an innocent human being. Fetuses are innocent human beings. Therefore, it is immoral to kill fetuses." does not fall under any of the specified defective argument types (G, FE, IR, RR, WCB, FU, DEP).
