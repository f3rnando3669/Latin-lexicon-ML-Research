For 
To apply <IDAA> to classify the given statement "Which logical reason supports the opposition to the motion 'Cell phones give off an unsafe radiation and should not be used,'" we need to decompose the task into specific steps and analyze the argument in detail. Here’s the step-by-step breakdown:

### Step 1: Understand the Statement
The task is to find a logical reason for opposing the motion that claims “Cell phones give off an unsafe radiation and should not be used.”

### Step 2: Identify the Argument and Reasoning
We need to find out possible reasons that could be given to oppose this motion. A logical reason might include scientific evidence debunking the assertion that cell phone radiation is unsafe.

### Step 3: Compare Against Known Fallacies
Considering the motion itself is a claim with a potentially weak or faulty basis, we need to avoid falling into defective reasoning when forming opposition. 

1. **Generalization (G):**
   - **Definition:** Claims a general truth based on a specific instance.
   - To avoid: Don’t oppose the motion with a counter-generalization based on limited instances.

2. **False Enumeration (FE):**
   - **Definition:** Lists fewer or more options than actually exist.
   - To avoid: Don’t argue that cell phones are safe based on oversimplified options or limited research.

3. **Inappropriate Reason (IR):**
   - **Definition:** Provides a reason that doesn't logically support the proposition.
   - To avoid: Ensure the reason directly relates to measured safety of cell phone radiation.

4. **Redundant Reason (RR):**
   - **Definition:** Repeats the claim using different words.
   - To avoid: Avoid simply stating that cell phones are safe without scientific evidence.

5. **Weak Causal Basis (WCB):**
   - **Definition:** Offers a causal basis that is not compelling enough to support the proposition.
   - To avoid: Don’t claim safety without robust scientific research proving no harm.

6. **False Universals (FU):**
   - **Definition:** Asserts universally agreed points without proof.
   - To avoid: Don’t rely on the popularity or universal usage of cell phones as evidence of safety.

7. **Double-Edged Phrases (DEP):**
   - **Definition:** Uses statements open to dual interpretations.
   - To avoid: Ensure clarity in argument to avoid misinterpretation.

### Step 4: Consider Logical Opposition
Focusing on sound scientific evidence is crucial. An appropriate logical counter-argument will be:

- **Presenting Peer-Reviewed Scientific Studies:**
  Oppose the motion by referencing comprehensive, peer-reviewed studies that show cell phone radiation levels are within safety limits established by major health organizations (e.g., WHO, FCC).

### Step 5: Classify the Statement Based on the Analysis:
An argument supporting the opposition should avoid defective argument types and be based on solid logic:

- **Non-Fallacious Reason:** Referencing established scientific research showing the emission levels of cell phones are safe and regulated by health authorities.

**Proper Argument Example:**
"Comprehensive studies conducted by the World Health Organization and the Federal Communications Commission have demonstrated that the radiation levels emitted by cell phones are well within the safety limits prescribed for human use."

### Conclusion:
To provide a logical reason opposing the motion "Cell phones give off an unsafe radiation and should not be used," use evidence from authoritative scientific studies demonstrating cell phone safety.

**Type of Defective Argument Avoided:**

Since we are ensuring the reason aligns well with scientific evidence, it doesn’t fall into any defective argument type:

- **Avoid <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, and <DEP> by providing factual data and robust, comprehensive research studies.**
