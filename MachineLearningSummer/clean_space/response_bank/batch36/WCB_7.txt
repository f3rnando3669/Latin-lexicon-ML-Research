To properly classify the argument "Global chocolate consumption is highest in Switzerland, yet people there are among the trimmest in the industrialized world. Therefore, it’s reasonable to conclude that chocolate helps keep your weight down," let's apply <IDAA> step-by-step:

### Step 1: Identify the Components of the Statement
- **Observation 1:** Global chocolate consumption is highest in Switzerland.
- **Observation 2:** People in Switzerland are among the trimmest in the industrialized world.
- **Conclusion:** Therefore, chocolate helps keep your weight down.

### Step 2: Evaluate Logical Structure
- The argument is attempting to establish causation between high chocolate consumption and maintaining a trim figure, based on correlation observed in Switzerland.

### Step 3: Match the Argument to Recognized Defective Types
We'll now compare this reasoning to each of the known defective argument types:

1. **<G> Generalization:** Claims a general truth based on a specific instance. While the argument is broad, it's using comparative statistics rather than generalizing an instance.
2. **<FE> False Enumeration:** Listing fewer or more options than exist. This argument doesn’t list limited choices.
3. **<IR> Inappropriate Reason:** Provides a reason that doesn’t logically support the proposition. The reason given here (high chocolate consumption in a specific country) does not directly support the proposition (chocolate keeps weight down).
4. **<RR> Redundant Reason:** States the proposition using different words, giving no new information. This isn’t restating the claim redundantly.
5. **<WCB> Weak Causal Basis:** Offers a causal basis that isn’t compelling enough to support the proposition. The argument implies causality (chocolate consumption → low weight) without sufficient evidence.
6. **<FU> False Universals:** Asserts universally agreed points without proof. While it makes a universal claim, it's more about flawed causation.
7. **<DEP> Double-Edged Phrases:** Uses statements that can be interpreted in dual ways. The statement is unambiguous.

### Step 4: Detailed Analysis for WCB and IR

- **WCB (Weak Causal Basis):** The primary defect stems from assuming that because two statistics co-exist, one must causally affect the other without substantiation. 
- **IR (Inappropriate Reason):** There's an element of the given reasoning failing to directly bolster the claim logically. Still, the core weakness lies in inadequate causal links.

### Conclusion
Based on a detailed analysis, the argument is most appropriately classified under **<WCB> (Weak Causal Basis)** because it attempts to draw a definitive causal relationship between chocolate consumption and maintaining a trim figure without robust evidence.

### Final Classification
The argument "Global chocolate consumption is highest in Switzerland, yet people there are among the trimmest in the industrialized world. Therefore, it’s reasonable to conclude that chocolate helps keep your weight down." is best classified as of type:

**<WCB> (Weak Causal Basis).**
