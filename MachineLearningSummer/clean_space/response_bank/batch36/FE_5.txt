To apply <IDAA>—the application of the decomposition of the task of classifying a defective argument type to the given string "America: Love it or leave it"—first, we'll break down the task into specific steps, then execute the classification process step by step.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition of <IDA>:

1. **Identify the Core Proposition and Reasoning:**
    - Proposition: Implicitly, the statement suggests that one should either fully support America or leave the country.
    - Reasoning: No explicit reason is provided, but it establishes a binary choice.

2. **Compare Against Known Defective Argument Types:**
    - **<G> Generalization:** This involves making a broad claim based on a specific instance.
    - **<FE> False Enumeration:** This involves listing fewer or more options than actually exist.
    - **<IR> Inappropriate Reason:** This provides a reason that doesn’t logically support the proposition.
    - **<RR> Redundant Reason:** This involves presenting the same reason as the proposition in different words.
    - **<WCB> Weak Causal Basis:** This offers a weak causal link.
    - **<FU> False Universals:** This asserts universally agreed-upon points without proof.
    - **<DEP> Double-Edged Phrases:** This involves using statements open to dual interpretations.

3. **Evaluate the Statement Against Each Type:**

- **Generalization (<G>):**
  - The statement isn’t generalizing an instance to a broader truth.

- **False Enumeration (<FE>):**
  - The statement presents a binary choice, simplifying the issue into two mutually exclusive and exhaustive options. This suggests fewer options than actually exist.
  
- **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>):**
  - No explicit inappropriate reason is provided.
  
- **Redundant Reason (<RR>):**
  - No redundancy in reasoning; it isn’t restating the proposition differently.
  
- **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>):**
  - The statement does not establish a causal relationship.
  
- **False Universals (<FU>):**
  - The statement doesn’t assert a universally agreed point without proof.
  
- **Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>):**
  - The statement isn't using language open to dual interpretations.

### Step-by-Step Application of the Decomposition to the Given Statement:

1. **Identify Core Proposition and Reasoning:**
   - Proposition: Implicitly, the statement suggests complete acceptance or complete rejection of America without any middle ground.

2. **Compare Against Known Defective Argument Types:**
   - The logical flaw lies in presenting an overly simplistic binary choice (either love America or leave it).

3. **Match the Argument Type:**
   - The argument seemingly aligns with **False Enumeration (<FE>)** because it presents fewer options than actually exist, ignoring the possibility of nuanced positions—such as constructive criticism with the aim of improving the country.

### Conclusion:

After detailed decomposition and analysis, the string "America: Love it or leave it" is classified as <FE> (False Enumeration).

### Final Classification:
The type of defective argument for "America: Love it or leave it" is:

**<FE> (False Enumeration)**.
