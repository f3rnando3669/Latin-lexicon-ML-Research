For 
To apply <IDAA> (the task of decomposing the classification of a defective argument into specific steps) to the string "The reason Donald Trump got elected was because liberals took political correctness too far," we'll use a systematic approach to identify the correct classification. Here is the step-by-step process:

### Step 1: Identify the Core Argument
- **Main Claim:** Donald Trump got elected.
- **Supporting Reason:** Because liberals took political correctness too far.

### Step 2: Analyze the Structure of the Argument
- Examine if the reason provided (liberals took political correctness too far) logically supports the main claim (Donald Trump got elected).

### Step 3: Compare the Argument with Defined Defective Argument Types
1. **Generalization (<G>):**
   - Does it claim a general truth based on a specific instance? Not applicable here as it does not generalize from a specific instance.

2. **False Enumeration (<FE>):**
   - Does it list fewer or more options than exist? Not applicable here as it does not involve listing options.

3. **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>):**
   - Does it provide a reason that doesn't logically support the proposition? This is a potential match. The reason given (liberals took political correctness too far) might not directly and logically explain why Donald Trump got elected, as there could be multiple factors involved in his election.

4. **Redundant Reason (<RR>):**
   - Does it restate the proposition using different words? Not applicable here, as the statement doesn't rephrase the main claim but gives a reason.

5. **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>):**
   - Does it offer a causal basis that isn’t compelling enough to support the proposition? This is another potential match. The argument implies a weak causal link, suggesting that one factor (political correctness) is responsible for a complex outcome (election of Trump) without substantial evidence.

6. **False Universals (<FU>):**
   - Does it assert universally agreed points without proof? Not applicable here as the argument doesn't assert universal agreement.

7. **Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>):**
   - Does it use statements open to dual interpretations, potentially against the speaker? Not applicable here as the statement is straightforward and not open to dual interpretations.

### Step 4: Consolidate Findings
From the analysis, the argument contains elements of both <IR> and <WCB>:
- **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>):** The reason provided might not logically support the outcome.
- **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>):** The causal link is weak and not sufficiently compelling on its own.

### Step 5: Classify the Argument
Given the detailed examination, the most fitting category is:

**<WCB> (Weak Causal Basis)** – The argument offers a weak causal relationship between the suggested reason (liberals taking political correctness too far) and the election of Donald Trump without substantial evidence to support it.

### Conclusion
Thus, the argument "The reason Donald Trump got elected was because liberals took political correctness too far" is best classified as <WCB> (Weak Causal Basis).
