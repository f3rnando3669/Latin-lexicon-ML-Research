For 
Let's apply the method of <IDAA> to the given statement "Three kids in one class failed the Jane Eyre quiz, I guess all the other classes will all fail it, too."

### Step-by-Step Decomposition and Application:

1. **Step 1: Identify the Core Proposition and Reasoning**
   - **Proposition:** "All the other classes will all fail the Jane Eyre quiz."
   - **Reasoning:** "Three kids in one class failed the Jane Eyre quiz."

2. **Step 2: Evaluate the Reasoning Against the Proposition**
   - **Observation:** The argument takes a specific instance (three kids in one class failing the quiz) and uses it to predict a general outcome (all other classes will fail the quiz).

3. **Step 3: Compare the Reasoning with Definitions of Defective Argument Types**

   a. **Generalization (<G>)**
      - **Description:** Claims a general truth based on a specific instance.
      - **Fit:** This argument generalizes from one instance (one class's performance) to a broader population (all other classes).

   b. **False Enumeration (<FE>)**
      - **Description:** Lists fewer or more options than actually exist.
      - **Fit:** This argument does not list options or falsely reduce options. It makes a prediction based on limited data.

   c. **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>)**
      - **Description:** Provides a reason that doesn’t logically support the proposition.
      - **Fit:** While the reasoning may be weak, it is not entirely inappropriate—the failure rate is related to the quiz's difficulty.

   d. **Redundant Reason (<RR>)**
      - **Description:** Appears to present a new reason but says the same thing as the proposition using different words.
      - **Fit:** The argument does not simply reiterate the proposition using different words.

   e. **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>)**
      - **Description:** Offers a causal basis that is not compelling enough to support the proposition.
      - **Fit:** There is no causal relationship being claimed here; the prediction is based on the observation.

   f. **False Universals (<FU>)**
      - **Description:** Asserts universally agreed points without proof.
      - **Fit:** The argument does not make an appeal to universal agreement.

   g. **Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>)**
      - **Description:** Uses statements open to dual interpretations.
      - **Fit:** There are no dual-meaning phrases in this argument.

4. **Step 4: Classify the Argument**
   - Given that the argument takes the experience of one specific instance and extends it to make a broad generalization about all other classes, the most fitting defective argument type is:

**<G> Generalization**

### Conclusion
The statement "Three kids in one class failed the Jane Eyre quiz, I guess all the other classes will all fail it, too." is classified under **<G> (Generalization)**.

### Summary:
By breaking down the argument and comparing it to predefined types, we've determined that the statement makes a broad claim based on a specific occurrence, which is best classified as a Generalization (<G>). 

**Type of Defective Argument for "Three kids in one class failed the Jane Eyre quiz, I guess all the other classes will all fail it, too.": <G>**
