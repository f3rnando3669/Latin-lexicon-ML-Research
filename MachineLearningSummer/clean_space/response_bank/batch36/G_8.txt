For 
Sure, let's apply <IDAA> to classify the given statement. Here's a step-by-step analysis:

### Step-by-Step Process Using <IDAA>

1. **Identify the Proposition and Reasoning in the Statement:**
    - **Proposition:** All of those who hate the Duterte administration are CPP-NPA supporters.
    - **Reasoning:** The statement implies that hating the Duterte administration is directly associated with being a CPP-NPA supporter.

2. **Analyze the Reasoning and Logic:**
    - The statement presents a direct association between two groups without additional evidence. It doesn’t account for the diversity of reasons individuals might have for opposing the Duterte administration.

3. **Compare the Argument Against Known Defective Argument Types:**
    - **<G> Generalization:** Claims a general truth based on specific instances.
    - **<FE> False Enumeration:** Lists fewer or more options than actually exist.
    - **<IR> Inappropriate Reason:** Provides a reason that doesn’t logically support the proposition.
    - **<RR> Redundant Reason:** Presents a reason that restates the proposition without new information.
    - **<WCB> Weak Causal Basis:** Offers a causal basis that is not compelling enough to support the proposition.
    - **<FU> False Universals:** Asserts universally agreed points without proof.
    - **<DEP> Double-Edged Phrases:** Uses statements open to dual interpretations.

4. **Determine the Best Fit for the Argument Type:**
    - **Generalization (<G>):** The statement makes a sweeping generalization that everyone who hates the Duterte administration must be a CPP-NPA supporter. This lumps all individuals with differing opinions into one category without supporting evidence.
    - **False Enumeration (<FE>):** The argument does not list options, so it doesn’t fit here.
    - **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>):** The reason isn’t entirely inappropriate; it’s more about making an unsupported generalization.
    - **Redundant Reason (<RR>):** The reasoning isn’t redundant.
    - **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>):** There may be vague elements of weak causality implied, but it primarily generalizes.
    - **False Universals (<FU>):** This isn’t about asserting universally agreed points.
    - **Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>):** There is no use of ambiguity or dual interpretations.

### Conclusion
Based on the analysis, the most appropriate classification for "All of those who hate the Duterte administration are CPP-NPA supporters." is:

**<G> Generalization**

It draws a broad, unsupported conclusion about a group of people based on a specific trait (opposition to Duterte).

So the statement "All of those who hate the Duterte administration are CPP-NPA supporters" is classified as <G> (Generalization).
