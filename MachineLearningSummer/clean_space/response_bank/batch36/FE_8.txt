### Step-by-Step Decomposition and Application of <IDAA> to the String

The task is to classify the given string "If you don't say the pledge of allegiance, then you must be a traitor" into one of the defective argument types: <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>.

### Step 1: Understand the Statement
- **Proposition**: Saying/not saying the pledge of allegiance determines one’s loyalty to the country.
- **Conclusion**: Not saying the pledge of allegiance makes one a traitor.

### Step 2: Identify the Reasoning and Logical Structure
- **Reasoning**: The statement sets up a dichotomy: either you say the pledge and are loyal (implied), or you don't say it and are a traitor.
- This logic suggests that not saying the pledge is synonymous with being a traitor.

### Step 3: Match Against Defective Argument Types

#### Analysis Across Types:
1. **<G> Generalization**:
   - Not applicable as it does not claim a general truth based on a specific instance.

2. **<FE> False Enumeration**:
   - **Description**: Lists fewer or more options than actually exist.
   - **Analysis**: This matches because the argument presents only two options: either you say the pledge or you are a traitor. It excludes other possible reasons or choices for not saying the pledge.

3. **<IR> Inappropriate Reason**:
   - **Description**: Provides a reason that doesn’t logically support the proposition.
   - **Analysis**: While the provided reasoning might be viewed as pushing a specific viewpoint, it is not entirely detached from the argument.

4. **<RR> Redundant Reason**:
   - **Description**: Restates the proposition with different words.
   - **Analysis**: No redundancy, as the argument offers a conditional statement, not mere repetition.

5. **<WCB> Weak Causal Basis**:
   - **Description**: Offers a causal basis that isn’t compelling enough.
   - **Analysis**: The argument does not imply a cause-effect relationship that can be analyzed for strength.

6. **<FU> False Universals**:
   - **Description**: Asserts universally agreed points without proof.
   - **Analysis**: The statement itself isn’t asserting a universal point, but rather creating an exclusionary category.

7. **<DEP> Double-Edged Phrases**:
   - **Description**: Uses phrases open to dual interpretations.
   - **Analysis**: The statement isn't ambiguous in a way that can be used against itself.

### Step 4: Determine the Best Fit
After analyzing the statement against all defective argument types, it becomes evident that the statement is oversimplifying the scenario into just two possibilities, thereby ignoring any other reasonable explanations or choices.

### Step 5: Conclusion
The statement "If you don't say the pledge of allegiance, then you must be a traitor" is best classified as a **<FE> False Enumeration** due to its presentation of a false dichotomy.

**Type of Defective Argument for "If you don't say the pledge of allegiance, then you must be a traitor.": <FE>**
