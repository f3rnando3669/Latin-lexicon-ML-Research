For 
To apply <IDAA> to the string "Encourages the audience to become part of a group or act because other people are acting in the same way," we need to decompose the task of classifying this argument into specific steps. Here is the step-by-step process:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition for <IDAA>:

**Step 1: Identify the Proposition and Reasoning in the Statement**
- **Proposition:** "Become part of a group or act."
- **Reasoning:** "Because other people are acting in the same way."

**Step 2: Analyze the Nature of the Reasoning Provided**
- The reasoning relies on the behavior of others as the basis for the action.

**Step 3: Compare with Definitions of Defective Argument Types**
- **<G> Generalization:** This argument does not claim a general truth based on a specific instance.
- **<FE> False Enumeration:** There is no listing of options.
- **<IR> Inappropriate Reason:** The reason given is relevant to the proposition, though it appeals to popularity.
- **<RR> Redundant Reason:** The reasoning is not a repetitive restatement of the proposition.
- **<WCB> Weak Causal Basis:** The argument does not establish a causal relationship.
- **<FU> False Universals:** This involves asserting universal points without proof. Specifically, stating that something should be done because others are doing it fits perfectly within this category.
- **<DEP> Double-Edged Phrases:** The statement doesnâ€™t involve dual interpretations.

**Step 4: Classify the Argument**
Given the definitions provided and the comparison made, the reasoning in this statement ("Encourages the audience to become part of a group or act because other people are acting in the same way") most closely fits the definition of <FU> (False Universals).

### Conclusion
Based on the analysis, the string "Encourages the audience to become part of a group or act because other people are acting in the same way" is an example of <FU> (False Universals).

**Classification: <FU>**

This follows from the steps of:
1. Identifying the reasoning structure.
2. Comparing it against known defective arguments.
3. Matching it to the definition of <FU> as an argument that appeals to popularity or universality without substantive proof.
