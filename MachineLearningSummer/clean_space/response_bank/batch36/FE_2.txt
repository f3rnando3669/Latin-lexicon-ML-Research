For 
Sure, let's apply <IDAA> to classify the string "You either support Hillary Clinton for President or you don't believe in women's rights" by decomposing the task step by step.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition of <IDA> into <IDAA>:

### Step 1: Identify the Structure and Content of the Statement

- **Main Proposition:** The statement presents a binary choice: "You either support Hillary Clinton for President or you don't believe in women's rights."

### Step 2: Analyze the Logical Structure

- The statement provides two options and implies they are mutually exclusive and exhaustive: 
  - Support Hillary Clinton.
  - Don't believe in women's rights.

### Step 3: Compare the Statement Against the Definitions of Defective Argument Types

1. **Generalization (G)**: Claiming a general truth based on a specific instance.
   - **Analysis**: The statement does not generalize a universal truth from a specific instance. Not applicable.

2. **False Enumeration (FE)**: Listing fewer or more options than actually exist.
   - **Analysis**: The statement limits the choices to only two options, ignoring other possibilities such as supporting women's rights but preferring another candidate, or believing in women's rights but having other policy reasons for not supporting Clinton. This fits under False Enumeration, as it creates a false dichotomy.

3. **Inappropriate Reason (IR)**: Providing a reason that doesn't logically support the proposition.
   - **Analysis**: The statement does not provide a separate reason that is unrelated to the proposition. Not the best fit.

4. **Redundant Reason (RR)**: Restating the proposition using different words.
   - **Analysis**: The statement does not redundantly restate the same proposition; it provides a false dichotomy. Not applicable.

5. **Weak Causal Basis (WCB)**: Offering a causal basis that is not compelling enough.
   - **Analysis**: While the connection between supporting women's rights and supporting Hillary Clinton is tenuous, this is more about the limitation of choices. Not the best fit.

6. **False Universals (FU)**: Asserting universally agreed points without proof.
   - **Analysis**: The statement does not assert a universally agreed point without proof directly. It implies a binary choice instead. Not the best fit.

7. **Double-Edged Phrases (DEP)**: Using statements open to dual interpretations.
   - **Analysis**: The statement is clear in its limited options without dual interpretations. Not applicable.

### Step 4: Evaluate and Determine the Best Match

- The statement "You either support Hillary Clinton for President or you don't believe in women's rights" is best classified under **False Enumeration (FE)** because it presents limited choices and ignores other plausible options or nuances in belief.

### Step 5: Conclusion

Based on the step-by-step analysis, the classification of the statement "You either support Hillary Clinton for President or you don't believe in women's rights" is:

**<FE> False Enumeration**

This statement is an example of false enumeration as it lists fewer options than actually exist, presenting an oversimplified binary choice.

**Final Classification: <FE>**
