For 
To apply <IDAA> to the argument "Every day, I eat cereal for breakfast. One time, I had a muffin instead, and there was a major earthquake in my city. I've eaten cereal ever since," we need to follow a step-by-step process of classifying the argument using specific defective argument types. Here's the detailed decomposition:

### Step-by-Step Application of <IDAA>

### Step 1: Identify the Core Proposition

- **Proposition:** Eating a muffin for breakfast causes major earthquakes.
- **Claim:** Eating cereal prevents earthquakes.

### Step 2: Break Down the Argument Structure
- **Observation:** "Every day, I eat cereal for breakfast."
- **Specific Instance:** "One time, I had a muffin instead."
- **Event:** "There was a major earthquake in my city."
- **Action Taken:** "I've eaten cereal ever since."

### Step 3: Analyze the Reasoning to Identify Logical Flaws
- Assess whether the reasoning provided is logically sound and whether the specific instance adequately supports the general conclusion.

### Step 4: Compare Against Definitions of Defective Argument Types

**<G> Generalization**: Claims a broad truth based on a specific instance.
- **Evaluation:** The argument doesnâ€™t generalize from the muffin incident to a law for the entire world.

**<FE> False Enumeration**: Lists fewer or more options than actually exist.
- **Evaluation:** The argument does not involve enumerating false choices.

**<IR> Inappropriate Reason**: Provides a reason that doesn't logically support the proposition.
- **Evaluation:** While unusual, the claim somewhat relates to the proposition.

**<RR> Redundant Reason**: The reason repeats the proposition using different words.
- **Evaluation:** The argument does not redundantly restate the proposition.

**<WCB> Weak Causal Basis**: Offers a causal basis that is not compelling enough to support the proposition.
- **Evaluation:** The main logical flaw is the weak causal link between eating a muffin and an earthquake, suggesting a flimsy cause-effect relationship without compelling evidence.

**<FU> False Universals**: Asserts universally agreed points without proof.
- **Evaluation:** The statement is not asserting a universally accepted truth.

**<DEP> Double-Edged Phrases**: Uses statements open to dual interpretations.
- **Evaluation:** There is no ambiguity or dual interpretation in the statement.

### Step 5: Classification
The statement fits the **Weak Causal Basis (WCB)** type best because it implies a weak and unsupported causal link. Eating a muffin once does not have a compelling scientific basis to be linked to causing an earthquake, and thus eating cereal is not logically proven to prevent earthquakes.

### Conclusion

The argument "Every day, I eat cereal for breakfast. One time, I had a muffin instead, and there was a major earthquake in my city. I've eaten cereal ever since." is classified under the defective argument type **<WCB> Weak Causal Basis**. This classification is due to the reliance on a weak and logically unsupported causal relationship between eating a muffin and the occurrence of an earthquake.
