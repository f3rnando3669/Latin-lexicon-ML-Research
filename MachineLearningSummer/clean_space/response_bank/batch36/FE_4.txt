For 
To apply <IDAA> (the decomposition of the task of classifying an argument type into specific steps) to the statement "I thought you were a good person, but you weren’t in class today," let's follow a structured step-by-step approach:

### Decomposition of IDA into Specific Steps (D)
1. **Identify the Proposition and Reason**: Determine the main proposition or claim and the reason provided.
2. **Analyze the Logical Relationship**: Evaluate the logical connection between the reason and the proposition.
3. **Compare with Known Defective Argument Types**: Examine whether the identified logical flaw fits any of the predefined defective argument types: <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>.
4. **Classify the Argument**: Assign the most fitting defective argument type based on the analysis.

### Application of IDAA to the Given Statement

1. **Identify the Proposition and Reason**
   - **Proposition**: "You are not a good person."
   - **Reason**: "You weren’t in class today."

2. **Analyze the Logical Relationship**
   - The argument implies a causation where the absence from class is taken as evidence of not being a good person.
   - The logical connection under scrutiny must be examined: Does absence from class logically support the claim of not being a good person?

3. **Compare with Known Defective Argument Types**
   - **Generalization (G)**: This is not a sweeping generalization based on a specific instance.
   - **False Enumeration (FE)**: This does not involve listing fewer or more options than actually exist.
   - **Inappropriate Reason (IR)**: This involves providing a reason that doesn't logically support the proposition. The absence from class does not logically imply that someone is not a good person.
   - **Redundant Reason (RR)**: Not a case of repeating the proposition with different wording.
   - **Weak Causal Basis (WCB)**: The statement does imply a weak causal basis since it ties being absent from class to being a bad person.
   - **False Universals (FU)**: It does not assert universally agreed points without proof.
   - **Double-Edged Phrases (DEP)**: There are no dual interpretations.

4. **Classify the Argument**
   - The reason given (absence from class) does not logically support the proposition (being a bad person).
   - This best fits the category of <IR> (Inappropriate Reason) because the absence from class doesn't logically lead to the conclusion that someone is not a good person.
   - Additionally, it also fits under <WCB> (Weak Causal Basis) because the causal connection inferred is not compelling enough.

### Conclusion
Given that the primary logical flaw is providing a reason that doesn’t logically support the conclusion, the classification of the statement “I thought you were a good person, but you weren’t in class today.” is:

**<IR> (Inappropriate Reason)** 

Thus, the argument is best classified under **<IR>** because the absence from class does not logically define someone's moral character.
Type of Defective Argument for 'I thought you were a good person, but you weren’t in class today.': <IR>
