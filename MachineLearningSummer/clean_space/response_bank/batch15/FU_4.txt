For 
Let's apply the IDAA decomposition to the given string: "Everyone else is doing it, so should you."

### Step 1: Analyze the Proposition
- Proposition: "You should do it."

### Step 2: Identify the Support
- Support: "Everyone else is doing it."

### Step 3: Compare with Argument Types
- We need to determine if the support provided fits any of the defective argument types: <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>.

### Step 4: Apply Heuristics

- **<G>**: Generalization – No specific instance is being generalized to a whole group here.
- **<FE>**: False Enumeration – No enumeration of options is present.
- **<IR>**: Inappropriate Reason – The reason ("everyone else is doing it") may not be directly relevant to why you should do it, but let's check other heuristics first.
- **<RR>**: Redundant Reason – The support is not a restatement of the proposition.
- **<WCB>**: Weak Causal Basis – There isn’t a causal argument being made.
- **<FU>**: False Universals – The argument relies heavily on the assumption that just because everyone is doing something, it is valid or you should do it too. This matches our description of <FU>.
- **<DEP>**: Double-Edged Phrases – The statement isn’t open to multiple interpretations in a way that could be used against the speaker.

### Step 5: Classify the String

Applying the heuristics, we see that "Everyone else is doing it, so should you" primarily relies on the idea that a universal agreement (everyone else is doing it) is sufficient reason for action. This fits the description of **<FU>** (False Universals) argument type.

#### Classification:
The string "Everyone else is doing it, so should you" is classified as **<FU>**.
