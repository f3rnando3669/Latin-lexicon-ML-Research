For 
Applying the process of <IDAA> to the given string, "I thought you were a good person, but you weren’t in class today.":

### Step-by-Step Decomposition of the Task

1. **Step 1: Identify the Argument's Core Proposition:**
   - The implied core proposition is that the person being addressed is not a good person.

2. **Step 2: Identify the Provided Reason:**
   - The reason provided to support the proposition is "you weren’t in class today."

3. **Step 3: Evaluate the Reason:**
   - Check if the reason logically supports the proposition or if it falls into one of the defective argument categories.

4. **Step 4: Classification Based on the Reason:**
   - The reasoning given ("you weren’t in class today") to claim that the person is not a good person does not logically connect with the core proposition. Being absent from class is not inherently indicative of being a good or bad person; the reason does not appropriately support the conclusion that the person is not good.

5. **Resulting Classification:**
   - This argument falls under <IR> (Inappropriate Reason), as the reason provided does not logically support the proposition.

### Summary
Using the decomposition steps outlined, the classification of the argument "I thought you were a good person, but you weren’t in class today." is an **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>)**.
