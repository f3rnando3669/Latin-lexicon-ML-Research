For 
To apply <IDAA> to the statement "People either like coffee or hate it," we will follow the steps for decomposing and classifying the defective argument type:

### Step 1: Identify the defective argument types

The types we need to consider are:
- <G> (Generalization)
- <FE> (False Enumeration)
- <IR> (Inappropriate Reason)
- <RR> (Redundant Reason)
- <WCB> (Weak Causal Basis)
- <FU> (False Universals)
- <DEP> (Double-Edged Phrases)

### Step 2: Analyze the statement

The statement is "People either like coffee or hate it." This suggests that there are only two possible attitudes towards coffee: liking it or hating it. The statement excludes any other potential attitudes or feelings towards coffee, such as indifference or a neutral stance.

### Step 3: Classify the statement

- **Generalization (<G>)**: This statement does not claim a general truth based on a specific instance, so it does not fit <G>.
- **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>)**: The statement does not provide a reason that is irrelevant to a specific proposition, so it does not fit <IR>.
- **Redundant Reason (<RR>)**: There is no repetition of a reason that states the same thing as the proposition using different words, so it does not fit <RR>.
- **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The statement does not offer a weak causal basis for a proposition, so it does not fit <WCB>.
- **False Universals (<FU>)**: The statement does not assert a universally agreed point without proof but provides a limited choice.
- **Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>)**: There is no dual interpretation that can potentially be against the speaker, so it doesn’t fit <DEP>.
- **False Enumeration (<FE>)**: The statement provides only two options (liking or hating coffee) and excludes other possibilities, which makes it a candidate for <FE>.

### Result

The statement “People either like coffee or hate it” fits the description of <FE> (False Enumeration) as it presents an oversimplified dichotomy, ignoring other potential attitudes towards coffee.

Thus, the classification for this statement is <FE>.
