For 
To apply <IDAA> to the given string "Encourages the audience to become part of a group or act because other people are acting in the same way," we will follow the detailed steps of decomposition outlined for <IDA>:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition of <IDA>:

**Step 1:** **Identify the Argument Type:**
- Read the given string carefully: "Encourages the audience to become part of a group or act because other people are acting in the same way."

**Step 2:** **Identify Key Features:**
- The key feature is the encouragement to follow the behavior of others simply because others are doing it. This implies an appeal to follow the majority.

**Step 3:** **Compare with Definitions:**
- Compare the identified features with the definitions of <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, and <DEP>.

**Step 4:** **Classification:**
- The string encourages people to join a group or act in a certain way purely because others are doing the same, without providing any substantial reason other than the popularity of the action. This fits the definition of <FU> (False Universals) which involves appealing to the idea that something should be done because many people are doing it or agreeing with it.

**Step 5:** **Double-check:**
- Recheck to ensure that no other argument types fit better.
    - **<G>:** Not a generalization based on a specific instance.
    - **<FE>:** Not listing fewer or more options than exist.
    - **<IR>:** The reason provided is relevant but weak (appeal to popularity), not entirely inappropriate.
    - **<RR>:** Not repeating the same reason in different words.
    - **<WCB>:** Not presenting a weak causal basis.
    - **<DEP>:** Not a double-edged phrase with dual interpretations.

Since none of the other categories fit better, the classification is confirmed as:

**Result:**
- **<FU> - False Universals**

### Conclusion:
The argument "Encourages the audience to become part of a group or act because other people are acting in the same way" is classified as <FU> because it appeals to a universally agreed point without proof, specifically leveraging the popularity of behavior as validation.
