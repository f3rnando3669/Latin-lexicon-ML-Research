For 
To apply <IDAA> to the string "Officer, I was only driving as fast as everyone around me. I'm sure I wasn't speeding.", we will decompose the classification task <IDA> into specific steps and follow them through.

### Decomposition of the Task `<IDA>` into Steps (`<D>`):
1. **Identify Argument Pattern**:
   - Read the string `<s>` and identify the type of argument it presents.

2. **Match against Definitions**:
   - Compare the identified argument pattern with the definitions of `<G>`, `<FE>`, `<IR>`, `<RR>`, `<WCB>`, `<FU>`, and `<DEP>`.

3. **Determine Criteria**: 
   - Check which criteria of defective arguments fit the string `<s>`.
     - Does it make a broad generalization?
     - Are there listed options that misrepresent reality?
     - Does it provide an illogical reason?
     - Is a redundant reasoning given?
     - Is a weak causal relationship proposed?
     - Does it universally assert an unproven point?
     - Are there any dual interpretations that could be against the speaker?

4. **Classify the Argument**:
   - Based on the criteria, classify the argument into one of the defective argument types.

5. **Verify Classification**:
   - Ensure the classification is correct by cross-referencing the provided examples of each defective argument type.

### Application of `<IDAA>` to String `<s>`:
String `<s>`: "Officer, I was only driving as fast as everyone around me. I'm sure I wasn't speeding."

1. **Identify Argument Pattern**:
   - The string is providing a reason or justification for the speaker's actions (driving speed).

2. **Match against Definitions**:
   - Compare the reason given with the characteristics of each defective argument type.

3. **Determine Criteria**:
   - Does this statement provide a reason for not speeding because others were also driving at the same speed?
     - Yes, it seems to rely on the idea that if everyone else is doing it, it must be okay.

4. **Classify the Argument**:
   - This fits the criteria for `<FU>` (False Universals), where universally agreed points are asserted without proof. In this case, the speaker uses the behavior of others to justify their own actions without any legal or logical basis.

5. **Verify Classification**:
   - Cross-referencing the provided examples of `<FU>` ("Everyone else is buying it, so you should too!" and "You appealed to popularity or the fact that many people do something as an attempted form of validation.") confirms that this argument is trying to validate the behavior based on what others are doing.

### Conclusion:
Based on the decomposition and analysis, the string "Officer, I was only driving as fast as everyone around me. I'm sure I wasn't speeding." is classified as `<FU>` (False Universals).
