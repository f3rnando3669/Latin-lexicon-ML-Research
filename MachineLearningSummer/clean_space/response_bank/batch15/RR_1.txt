For 
To apply \(<IDAA>\) (the decomposition-based classification task) to the string "Paranormal activity is real because I have experienced what can only be described as paranormal activity.", we will follow the defined steps:

### Step 1: Parse the Argument String

The given argument string is:
\[ s = "Paranormal activity is real because I have experienced what can only be described as paranormal activity." \]

### Step 2: Apply the Classification Task \( <IDA> \)

We will examine the argument to determine which of the defective argument types it fits into. Here's a closer look at the statement:

- **Claim**: "Paranormal activity is real"
- **Reason**: "I have experienced what can only be described as paranormal activity"

### Step 3: Validate the Classification 

We analyze whether the reason logically supports the proposition:

- The reason provided, "I have experienced what can only be described as paranormal activity," attempts to validate the claim "Paranormal activity is real" by citing a personal experience.
- The justification for the claim is a restatement of the claim itself without providing independent support or new information.

### Step 4: Provide Justification

This argument fits into the category of Redundant Reason (\(<RR>\)), defined as presenting a reason that says the same thing as the proposition using different words.

- **Reasoning**: The statement "I have experienced what can only be described as paranormal activity" rephrases the claim "Paranormal activity is real." The purported evidence ("I have experienced what can only be described as paranormal activity") simply reiterates the claim without independent corroboration or logical support.

### Step 5: Summarize Results

The classification for the argument string is:

- \( s = "Paranormal activity is real because I have experienced what can only be described as paranormal activity." \) -> \( <RR> \)

In conclusion, the argument "Paranormal activity is real because I have experienced what can only be described as paranormal activity" is classified as \( <RR> \) (Redundant Reason) because the reason provided essentially restates the claim without offering new supporting evidence.
