For 
To apply <IDAA> to the string "My best friend says you’re a liar, so I’m not going to talk to you," we will follow the structured steps:

### Steps to Decompose <IDA>

1. **Identification**: Identify the argument type in the string.
2. **Analysis**: Break down the argument to see the components and their relationships.
3. **Matching**: Compare the structure and content of the string with the definitions of each defective argument type.
4. **Classification**: Assign the appropriate label to the string.

### Applying <IDAA>

**String <s>**: "My best friend says you’re a liar, so I’m not going to talk to you."

1. **Identification**: Recognize the nature of the argument.
   - Argument type: An appeal to an authority or another person's claim.

2. **Analysis**:
   - Proposition: "I’m not going to talk to you."
   - Reason: "My best friend says you’re a liar."

3. **Matching**: Check the reason against the definitions of defective argument types:
   - **Generalization (<G>)**: This argument does not generalize from a specific instance.
   - **False Enumeration (<FE>)**: This argument does not list limited or excessive options.
   - **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>)**: The reason provided ("My best friend says you’re a liar") might not logically support the action (not talking to the person). This appears to be an appeal to an authority without establishing the truth of the claim.
   - **Redundant Reason (<RR>)**: This does not repeat the proposition with different words.
   - **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The cause-and-effect relationship here is weak, as the claim of being a liar by a third party is not substantiated.
   - **False Universals (<FU>)**: There is no unsubstantiated universal claim.
   - **Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>)**: This argument does not use ambiguous language open to dual interpretations.

4. **Classification**: Since the reason provided ("My best friend says you’re a liar") does not logically support the proposition ("so I’m not going to talk to you") and lacks proper establishment, it matches the definition of Inappropriate Reason (<IR>).

Thus, the string "My best friend says you’re a liar, so I’m not going to talk to you" is classified as <IR>.
