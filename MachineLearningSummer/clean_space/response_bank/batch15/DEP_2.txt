Sure, let's apply the <IDAA> process to the given dialogue:

### Argument:
```
Speaker 1: We are using thousands of people, who are going door to door to help us spread the word about social injustice and the need for change.
Speaker 2: Well then, I can’t be a part of this because I was always taught that it’s wrong to use people.
```

### 1. Reading the Argument:
Carefully read and understand the exchange between the two speakers.

### 2. Identifying Key Components:
- **Speaker 1's statement:** Using thousands of people to spread the word about social injustice and the need for change.
- **Speaker 2's response:** Refusal to participate based on being taught that it's wrong to use people.

### 3. Matching Components to Definitions:
Analyze each statement for possible defective argument types.

- **Generalization (<G>):** No evidence of claiming a general truth based on a specific instance.
- **False Enumeration (<FE>):** No limited choices presented.
- **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>):** The argument provided by Speaker 2 seems to be based on a misinterpretation of the word "use."
- **Redundant Reason (<RR>):** No restatement of the proposition using different words.
- **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>):** No causal relationship provided by Speaker 2.
- **False Universals (<FU>):** No universally agreed points asserted without proof.
- **Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>):** Potential dual interpretation of the word "use."

### 4. Matching to a Specific Defective Argument Type:
- **Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>):** This seems to fit best because Speaker 2's argument hinges on the dual interpretation of "use," which could mean exploiting people or simply employing them for a cause. In the context provided by Speaker 1, "use" implies mobilizing individuals for a positive cause. However, Speaker 2 interprets it negatively, as exploitation.

### 5. Classify the Argument:
Classify the argument as <DEP> (Double-Edged Phrases).

### Conclusion:
By breaking down the task into specific steps, we determine that Speaker 2's response is an example of <DEP> because it leverages a double-edged phrase "use" with potential for dual interpretation against the speaker.
