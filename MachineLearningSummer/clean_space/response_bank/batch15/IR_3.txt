For 
Let's decompose the task of classifying the string into specific steps, as outlined by the <IDAA> definition:

### Step 1: **Identification**
Identify the main claim or statement in the string.

**Observation:** The string discusses the logical fallacy known as "moving the goalposts" and provides examples of how arguments for the existence of God evolve as scientific explanations replace older arguments.

### Step 2: **Analysis**
Break down the statement to understand its structure and underlying logic.

**Breakdown:**
- The primary topic is the argument for the existence of God.
- It is noted that as science advances, traditional arguments for God are replaced by new ones.
- Examples provided include the shift from creationism to intelligent design and the origin of life.
- The metaphor of "moving the goalposts" is explained and differentiated from arguments that involve multiple propositions.

### Step 3: **Classification**
Determine which defective argument type best fits the structure and logic of the statement.

**Classification:**
- **Generalization (<G>):** Does not apply as the text does not claim a general truth based on a specific instance.
- **False Enumeration (<FE>):** Does not fit as the text does not list fewer or more options than exist.
- **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>):** Not applicable as the reasons provided are not unrelated or illogical per the proposition.
- **Redundant Reason (<RR>):** Not applicable, because the text does not repetitively state the same thing.
- **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>):** May apply if the examples fail to robustly connect to the proposition about changing arguments.
- **False Universals (<FU>):** Repetition of popular but unsupported claims about the evolving arguments for God's existence. The exact line, "this fallacy frequently used on the Internet," could potentially qualify under Unsupported Popularity.
- **Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>):** Does not fit as the text is not using statements that are open to dual interpretation against the speaker.

The detailed analysis focuses on evolving arguments for God's existence through examples in a non-formal manner, and it touches upon broad claims without presenting verifiable proof directly, which is indicative of **False Universals (<FU>)** as it asserts commonly understood points without academic backing.

Therefore, the string "Perhaps the most classic example of this fallacy is the argument for the existence of God. ..." can be classified primarily under **False Universals (<FU>)** due to the way it's asserting points broadly accepted or discussed in popular context without definitive proofs.
