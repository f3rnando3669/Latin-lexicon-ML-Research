For 
Sure, let's apply the structured decomposition <IDAA> to classify the given statement "You either support Hillary Clinton for President or you don't believe in women's rights":

1. **Step-by-Step Decomposition**:

   1. **Analyze `<s>`**:
      - Read the content: "You either support Hillary Clinton for President or you don't believe in women's rights."
      - Understand the argument: The proposition is implying that supporting Hillary Clinton is synonymous with believing in women's rights.

   2. **Spot Indicator Keywords/Patterns**:
      - Identify keyword: "either/or" structure.
      - Recognize the binary choice presented: Support Hillary Clinton (Option 1) or don't believe in women's rights (Option 2).

   3. **Match with Definitions**:
      - Compare characteristics based on the identified indicator:
        - **<G> (Generalization)**: The statement isn't claiming a general truth based on a specific instance.
        - **<FE> (False Enumeration)**: The statement appears to present a binary choice, asserting there are only two possibilities when there may be more.
        - **<IR> (Inappropriate Reason)**: The reason given (supporting Clinton) logically supports believing in women's rights, which is relevant but not the only possible stance.
        - **<RR> (Redundant Reason)**: No redundant phrasing observed; the statement presents a single argument.
        - **<WCB> (Weak Causal Basis)**: No causal relationship is being presented in this statement.
        - **<FU> (False Universals)**: The statement doesn't assert a universally agreed point without proof but rather presents a binary choice.
        - **<DEP> (Double-Edged Phrases)**: The statement is not open to dual interpretations leading to contradictory understandings.

   4. **Conclude Classification**:
      - The analysis shows that the statement fits best with <FE> (False Enumeration) because it falsely lists only two options (either support Hillary Clinton or don't believe in women's rights) when more options could exist (such as supporting women's rights but preferring another candidate).

**Conclusion:**
The given statement "You either support Hillary Clinton for President or you don't believe in women's rights" is classified as <FE> (False Enumeration).
