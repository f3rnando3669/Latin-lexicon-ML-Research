For 
To apply <IDAA> to the given conversation, we follow the steps outlined in the decomposition (<D>). Here is the application step-by-step:

### Example String:

**Speaker 1:** Jesus was not really crucified.  
**Speaker 2:** How do I know that’s true?  
**Speaker 1:** Because the Quran says so.  
**Speaker 2:** How do I know the Quran is correct?  
**Speaker 1:** Because the Quran is the Word of God, and everything it says is true.  
**Speaker 2:** How do I know that’s true?  
**Speaker 1:** Because God tells us so, here in the Koran.

### Steps:

1. **Identify the Argument:**
   - Proposition: **Speaker 1** claims, "Jesus was not really crucified."
   - Supporting Reason: "Because the Quran says so."
   - Additional Reason: "Because the Quran is the Word of God, and everything it says is true."
   - Circular Reference: "God tells us so, here in the Koran."

2. **Analyze the Argument:**
   - **Speaker 1** uses the Quran as the basis for their claim.
   - The validation of the Quran's truth is also based on the Quran, implying a circular reasoning.
   - The argument does not provide independent evidence outside of the Quran to support its claim.

3. **Match with Defective Argument Types:**
   - The argument primarily rests on circular reasoning, where the evidence provided (the Quran) references itself as the validation.
   - It is not Generalization (<G>), False Enumeration (<FE>), Inappropriate Reason (<IR>), Redundant Reason (<RR>), Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>), False Universals (<FU>), or Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>).

4. **Select the Closest Match:**
   - The argument's primary flaw appears to be the reliance on circular reasoning, where the Quran is used to validate its own claims.

Note: While circular reasoning is not explicitly listed in the provided defective argument types, it shares similarities with the concept of **Redundant Reason (<RR>)**, where a reason given essentially repeats the proposition in different words. 

- **Speaker 1's** argument seems to fit best with **Redundant Reason (<RR>)** because the validation loop repeats the same claim without independent verification.

5. **Output the Classification:**
   - Classification: <RR>

### Conclusion
Based on the decomposition and application steps, the appropriate classification for the conversation is **Redundant Reason (<RR>)**. The argument fails to provide independent evidence, instead, it redundantly reasserts the claim through circular reasoning.
