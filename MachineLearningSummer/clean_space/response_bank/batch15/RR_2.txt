For 
To classify the string "We need to fix our broken judicial system by electing new people." using the task decomposition <D>, let's apply the step-by-step process:

### Step-by-Step Classification:

1. **Initial Analysis:**
   - The argument suggests that in order to fix the judicial system, new people need to be elected.

2. **Identify Key Indicators:**
   - Does it make a broad claim based on a specific instance as in Generalization (<G>)? 
     - No, it's not making a sweeping statement based on limited instances.
   - Does it present a false binary choice or incomplete set of options as in False Enumeration (<FE>)?
     - Potentially. It implies that electing new people is the only way to fix the judicial system, not considering other solutions.
   - Does it provide a reason that doesn't logically support the proposition as in Inappropriate Reason (<IR>)?
     - No, the reason logically relates to the proposition.
   - Does it restate the proposition in different words as in Redundant Reason (<RR>)?
     - No, it doesn't just repeat the proposition.
   - Does it offer a weak causal basis as in Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>)?
     - It could be argued this way if the causal relationship between electing new people and fixing the judicial system isn't properly established, but typically this would need more context.
   - Does it make assertions about universal agreement without proof as in False Universals (<FU>)?
     - No, there's no assertion of universal agreement.
   - Does it use statements open to dual interpretations as in Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>)?
     - No, the statement isn't particularly ambiguous.

3. **Match the Features:**
   - The primary feature here is presenting the transition of electing new people as the sole solution to fixing the judicial system.

4. **Final Classification:**
   - This most closely matches **False Enumeration (<FE>)**, because it restricts the options to just electing new people without considering other potential solutions.

Therefore, the string "We need to fix our broken judicial system by electing new people." would be classified as **<FE>** (False Enumeration).
