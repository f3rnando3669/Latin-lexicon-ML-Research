Great! Let's walk through the application of <IDAA> to classify the statement "It is immoral to kill an innocent human being. Fetuses are innocent human beings. Therefore, it is immoral to kill fetuses."

### Step 1: Collecting Sample Statements
The given statement "It is immoral to kill an innocent human being. Fetuses are innocent human beings. Therefore, it is immoral to kill fetuses." is our sample statement.

### Step 2: Preprocessing for Classification
Here, we would standardize the statement:
- Remove unnecessary punctuation
- Normalize text (e.g., all lowercase)

However, the statement is already clean and well-formed, so minimal preprocessing is necessary.

### Step 3: Feature Selection
Identify key features:
- "It is immoral to kill an innocent human being."
- "Fetuses are innocent human beings."
- "Therefore, it is immoral to kill fetuses."

### Step 4: Training the Model (if automated)
If we were automating this, we would train a model using a dataset of statements labeled with the types <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, and <DEP>. This step would include splitting the dataset into training and validation sets, extracting features, and training the model.

### Step 5: Classification
Determine the type of fallacy manually or use the trained model.

#### Manual Analysis:
- The first sentence establishes a general moral principle: "It is immoral to kill an innocent human being."
- The second sentence makes a categorical statement about fetuses: "Fetuses are innocent human beings."
- The third sentence draws a conclusion based on the first two: "Therefore, it is immoral to kill fetuses."

### Step 6: Validation and Correction
Review the analysis:
- The argument structure is a form of syllogism that seeks to draw a conclusion from two premises.
- The argument assumes universal agreement with the premise "It is immoral to kill an innocent human being" without providing additional proof specific to the status of fetuses.

Let's cross-reference with our types:
1. **<G> (Generalization):** Not applicable; it's not claiming a general truth from a specific instance.
2. **<FE> (False Enumeration):** Not applicable; no enumeration of options.
3. **<IR> (Inappropriate Reason):** Not directly applicable; the reason here follows the logical structure.
4. **<RR> (Redundant Reason):** Not applicable; the conclusion is derived logically from premises.
5. **<WCB> (Weak Causal Basis):** Not applicable; not offering a weak causal nexus.
6. **<FU> (False Universals):** Possibly applicable; it takes "It is immoral to kill an innocent human being" as a universally agreed point without proof, applying it broadly to fetuses.
7. **<DEP> (Double-Edged Phrases):** Not applicable; no dual interpretations are present.

### Step 7: Iterative Improvement
Based on this analysis, we classify the statement:

**Classification: <FU> (False Universals)** - The argument uses the assumption that "It is immoral to kill an innocent human being" is universally accepted and applies it without proving the status of fetuses specifically.

---

Thus, by following the steps of <IDAA>, we classified "It is immoral to kill an innocent human being. Fetuses are innocent human beings. Therefore, it is immoral to kill fetuses." as **<FU> (False Universals)**.
