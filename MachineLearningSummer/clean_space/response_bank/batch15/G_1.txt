For 
Let's apply the decomposition task <IDAA> to classify the string "I heard that the Catholic Church was involved in a sex scandal cover-up. Therefore, my 102-year-old Catholic neighbor, who frequently attends Church, is guilty as well!"

### Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1:** Read and understand the string <s>.
   - String: "I heard that the Catholic Church was involved in a sex scandal cover-up. Therefore, my 102-year-old Catholic neighbor, who frequently attends Church, is guilty as well!"

**Step 2:** Identify keywords or phrases in <s> that indicate the nature of the argument.
   - Keywords: "I heard that the Catholic Church was involved in a sex scandal cover-up." and "my 102-year-old Catholic neighbor, who frequently attends Church, is guilty as well!"

**Step 3:** Match the identified nature with the definitions provided for <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>.
   - This argument infers a general guilt based on a specific instance related to the Catholic Church. This indicates a generalization.
   - Such an inference fits the definition of a generalization since it improperly extends a characteristic of the group to an individual without valid evidence.

**Step 4:** Assign the appropriate classification label to <s>.
   - Label: <G> (Generalization).

Thus, applying <IDAA> to the string "I heard that the Catholic Church was involved in a sex scandal cover-up. Therefore, my 102-year-old Catholic neighbor, who frequently attends Church, is guilty as well!" leads us to classify it as <G>.
