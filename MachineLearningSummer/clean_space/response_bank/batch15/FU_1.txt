For 
Let's apply the decomposition method (<D>) to the task of identifying defective arguments (<IDA>) for the statement "Get Verizon--1 billion people can't be wrong."

### Steps for <IDAA>:

1. **Identify the Proposition**: 
   - The statement is encouraging people to get Verizon by implying that a large number of people using it validates its quality or service.

2. **Analyze the Nature of the Claim**: 
   - The claim is using the fact that many people (1 billion) use Verizon as a justification for why someone else should also use it.

3. **Match the Nature of the Claim to Definitions**:
   - Compare with **<G>**: 
     - Not a generalization based on a specific instance. Not applicable.
   - Compare with **<FE>**: 
     - Not presenting an incorrect number of options. Not applicable.
   - Compare with **<IR>**: 
     - Not providing an inappropriate reason in a way that doesn't logically support the argument. Not applicable.
   - Compare with **<RR>**: 
     - Not restating the same argument in different words. Not applicable.
   - Compare with **<WCB>**: 
     - Not offering a weak causal argument. Not applicable.
   - Compare with **<FU>**:
     - Asserting a universally accepted point without offering proof. The statement implies that because a large number of people use Verizon, it must be the right choice, essentially appealing to popularity as a form of validation.
   - Compare with **<DEP>**: 
     - Not using a statement with dual interpretations. Not applicable.

4. Based on the analysis, the claim mostly aligns with the definition of **False Universals (<FU>)**.

### Conclusion:

The statement "Get Verizon--1 billion people can't be wrong." is classified as **False Universals (<FU>)** because it appeals to the popularity of Verizon as validation for why someone should choose it, asserting a universally accepted point without providing concrete evidence.

Thus, following the decomposition steps for the classification task, we have applied **<IDAA>** to correctly identify the defective argument type for the given statement.
