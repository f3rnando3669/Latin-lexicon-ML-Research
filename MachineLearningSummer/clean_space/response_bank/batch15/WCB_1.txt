For 
Let's apply the decomposition process (<D>) to classify the given string "The reason Donald Trump got elected was because liberals took political correctness too far." under the <IDAA> task.

1. **Identify the Proposition**:
   - The core claim is that the election of Donald Trump was caused by liberals taking political correctness too far.

2. **Determine the Argument Type**:
   - The argument establishes a causal link between two events:
     - Event 1: Liberals taking political correctness too far.
     - Event 2: Donald Trump getting elected.

3. **Match to Fallacy**:
   - **Generalization (G)**: The argument doesn't claim a general truth from a specific instance.
   - **False Enumeration (FE)**: The argument doesn't list options, so it doesn't limit or improperly list choices.
   - **Inappropriate Reason (IR)**: The reason given (political correctness) seems related to the proposition (Trump's election), so it is not unrelated.
   - **Redundant Reason (RR)**: The reason doesn't restate the proposition in a different way; it provides a causal explanation.
   - **Weak Causal Basis (WCB)**: The causal link being proposed (that liberalsâ€™ political correctness led to Trump's election) may not be compelling enough and is open to question. It simplifies a complex socio-political event into a single, possibly insufficient cause.
   - **False Universals (FU)**: The argument doesn't assert universally agreed points without proof.
   - **Double-Edged Phrases (DEP)**: The statement isn't open to dual interpretations that could potentially be used against the speaker.

4. **Classification**:
   - The argument attempts to provide a causal relationship that appears overly simplified and not necessarily compelling enough to justify the claim that liberals' actions directly led to Trump's election. Therefore, it matches the criteria for **Weak Causal Basis (WCB)**.

Thus, the string "The reason Donald Trump got elected was because liberals took political correctness too far." would be classified as <WCB>.
