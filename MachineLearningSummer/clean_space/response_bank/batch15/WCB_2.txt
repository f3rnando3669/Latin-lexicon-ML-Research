To classify the string "Farmer McDonald: Ever since they put up that new power plant across the river, we haven't had a bit of rain. I'm tellin' you, mankind has got too big for its britches when it fiddles around with nature." using the steps from IDAA, we'll proceed as follows:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition for Classifying Defective Argument Types (IDAA):

1. **Identify the Central Claim:**
   - The central claim in the statement is that the new power plant across the river is responsible for the lack of rain.

2. **Analyze the Supporting Evidence or Reasoning:**
   - The reasoning provided is that the construction of the power plant correlates with the lack of rain.

3. **Match Argument to Defective Type:**
   - Compare this reasoning to the defined defective argument types:
     - **<G> Generalization:** This argument does not seem to be generalizing from a specific instance.
     - **<FE> False Enumeration:** This argument does not list options, so it’s not a false enumeration.
     - **<IR> Inappropriate Reason:** The argument seems to be attempting to provide a causal link rather than an irrelevant reason.
     - **<RR> Redundant Reason:** The reason does not simply restate the proposition.
     - **<WCB> Weak Causal Basis:** The causal link provided (power plant causing no rain) is weak and not compelling.
     - **<FU> False Universals:** The argument does not assert a universally agreed point without proof.
     - **<DEP> Double-Edged Phrases:** The argument does not use statements with dual interpretations.

4. **Examine Specific Examples:**
   - The phrase “Ever since they put up that new power plant across the river, we haven't had a bit of rain” indicates an attempt to establish a causal relationship between two events (building a power plant and the lack of rain).

5. **Apply Knowledge of Fallacies:**
   - Understanding the fallacy of weak causal basis (correlation does not imply causation) helps identify this.

6. **Classify the Argument:**
   - Based on the analysis, the string should be classified as <WCB> Weak Causal Basis.

### Conclusion:
The statement "Farmer McDonald: Ever since they put up that new power plant across the river, we haven't had a bit of rain. I'm tellin' you, mankind has got too big for its britches when it fiddles around with nature." is an example of a Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>). The argument weakly links the construction of the power plant with the lack of rain without providing compelling causal evidence.
