For 
To apply <IDAA> (the decomposition steps to identify the defective argument) to the statement "That restaurant is popular because everyone in town goes there.", we follow the steps outlined:

### Steps for <D> in the context of <IDAA>:

**Step 1:** Analyze the statement in <s> to understand its structure and content.

- The statement claims that the restaurant is popular and provides a reason: "because everyone in town goes there."

**Step 2:** Compare the analyzed statement with each defined defective argument type.

- **Generalization (<G>):** This is not a generalized statement based on a specific instance.
- **False Enumeration (<FE>):** The statement doesn't list fewer or more options than actually exist.
- **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>):** The reason provided should logically support the proposition, so we need to check this explicitly.
- **Redundant Reason (<RR>):** The statement and the reason don't seem to restate each other in different words.
- **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>):** There is a causal relationship implied here ("popular" because "everyone goes"), but we need to judge if it is compelling or logical.
- **False Universals (<FU>):** This involves asserting something widely accepted without proof.
- **Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>):** The statement doesn't seem to have dual interpretations.

**Step 3:** Identify which defective argument type matches the analysis of the statement.

- The statement "That restaurant is popular because everyone in town goes there." suggests the restaurant's popularity is based solely on its attendance. This aligns closely with the faulty logic of **False Universals (<FU>)**, where common acceptance (everyone goes) is used as proof of popularity (without further valid reasoning).

However, let's inspect **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The causal relationship doesn't convince. It merely states that the reason for popularity (a broader term involving quality, service, etc.) is solely attendee numbers, a potentially insufficient basis for true popularity.

**Step 4:** Validate the identification by checking if the example fits the defining characteristics of the identified type.

- **False Universals (<FU>):** The argument assumes universal behavior without proof of why the restaurant should be popular.
- **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>):** The evidence (attendance) might not adequately support the proposition (popularity).

Given the statement primarily hinges on popularity purely from attendance figures, it fits **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>)** due to the implied insufficient causal reason.

### Final Identification:

The defective argument type for the statement "That restaurant is popular because everyone in town goes there." is **<WCB> (Weak Causal Basis)**.
