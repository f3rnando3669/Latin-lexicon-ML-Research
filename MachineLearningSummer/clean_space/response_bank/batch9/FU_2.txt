To identify the type of defective argument in the string "Encourages the audience to become part of a group or act because other people are acting in the same way," we will apply the step-by-step decomposition method (<IDAA>) as described.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition for Identification of Defective Argument Types (<IDAA>)

#### Step 1: Identify the Proposition and the Support
- **Proposition**: The audience should become part of a group or act in a certain way.
- **Support**: Other people are acting in the same way.

#### Step 2: Check for Specific Argument Types
- **Check for Generalization (<G>)**: No, it does not make a broad claim based on a specific instance.
- **Check for False Enumeration (<FE>)**: No listing of restricted or exaggerated options.
- **Check for Inappropriate Reason (<IR>)**: No irrelevant reason provided here that does not logically support the proposition.
- **Check for Redundant Reason (<RR>)**: No restatement of the proposition in other words.
- **Check for Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: No weak causal connection offered.
- **Check for False Universals (<FU>)**: Yes, it asserts a universally agreed-upon point without proof by suggesting that one should act because others are doing so, which is appealing to popularity or common practice without providing valid rationale.
- **Check for Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>)**: No dual interpretation present.

#### Step 3: Validate and Categorize
- **Validation**: The argument fits the characteristics of False Universals (<FU>), as it appeals to the audience to follow an action based on the claim that many people are doing it without any further logical reasoning.
- **Category**: **False Universals (<FU>)**

### Conclusion
Thus, the string "Encourages the audience to become part of a group or act because other people are acting in the same way" represents the fallacy of False Universals (<FU>).
