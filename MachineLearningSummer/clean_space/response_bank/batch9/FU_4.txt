For 
Let's apply the detailed decomposition process **<IDAA>** to the given argument "Everyone else is doing it, so should you":

### Decomposition Steps (from **<D>**):

1. **Receive Input String <s>**: 
   - Input is: "Everyone else is doing it, so should you."

2. **Identify Keywords**: 
   - Keywords: "Everyone else," "so should you."
   - These keywords indicate a universal appeal based on what others are doing.

3. **Analyze Sentence Structure**: 
   - The argument is suggesting behavior based on what everyone else is doing.
   - It implies a rationale that if everyone is doing something, then one should follow.

4. **Evaluate Strength of Causal Links**: 
   - The cause (everyone else doing it) is not a substantial reason for an individual to do it. This could lead our investigation towards either <WCB> or <FU>.

5. **Check for Universals**: 
   - The term "everyone else" clearly indicates a universal statement suggesting that what is right for everyone else should be right for you too.
   - This characteristic is a hallmark of <FU> (False Universals).

6. **Identify Ambiguity**: 
   - There is no dual interpretation or ambiguity in the statement which would lean towards <DEP>.


### Make a Decision:

Based on the analysis:
- The argument making use of "everyone else" claims universal agreement or behavior without offering any substantial proof or logical reasoning to support why the individual should follow suit. This is a classic example of <FU> (False Universals).

### Return Result:

- **Output**: <FU>

Therefore, the defective argument type of the string "Everyone else is doing it, so should you" is identified as **<FU> (False Universals)**.
