### Application of Decomposition to <IDA> (<IDAA>)

We will apply the decomposition steps to the given string "My best friend says you’re a liar, so I’m not going to talk to you."

1. **Text Analysis**:
   - **Step 1**: Extract the core claim or proposition from the string.
     - Core claim: "I’m not going to talk to you."
   - **Step 2**: Identify any reasoning or evidence provided to support the claim.
     - Reasoning: "My best friend says you’re a liar."

2. **Pattern Recognition**:
   - **Step 3**: Compare the extracted reasoning with known patterns of defective argument types.
     - Let's assess the reasoning provided: The reasoning ("My best friend says you’re a liar") is used to support the decision ("I’m not going to talk to you").
   - **Step 4**: Determine if the reasoning matches one of the defective argument subtypes.
     - The reasoning here seems to appeal to an authority (the best friend) without providing sufficient evidence about the actual claim made (that the person is a liar).

3. **Classification**:
   - **Step 5**: Classify the defective argument based on the identified pattern.
     - The argument seems to fall under the category where a reason is provided that may not be logically supportive or sufficient to justify the claim. This resembles the pattern of an <IR> Inappropriate Reason, since the authority of the best friend is being used improperly to justify the conclusion.

   Complete the steps:
   - **Step 1**: Extract core claim: "I’m not going to talk to you."
   - **Step 2**: Identify reasoning: "My best friend says you’re a liar."
   - **Step 3**: Compare with known patterns: The reasoning fits the pattern where an inappropriate or insufficient reason is used.
   - **Step 4**: Determine fit: Matches characteristics of <IR> Inappropriate Reason.
   - **Step 5**: Classify: <IR> Inappropriate Reason.

4. **Explanation**:
   - **Step 7**: Provide a rationale: The argument uses the claim of a best friend without providing direct evidence or reasoning to substantiate why the person should be considered a liar or why that would warrant not talking to them.
   - **Step 8**: Cite examples or explanations that align with the classification for clearer understanding: This is similar to cases where someone might say "Don't you want the best for your baby?" as an inappropriate reason to support an unrelated proposition.

By following these steps, the string "My best friend says you’re a liar, so I’m not going to talk to you." is classified as <IR> Inappropriate Reason with the provided rationale.
