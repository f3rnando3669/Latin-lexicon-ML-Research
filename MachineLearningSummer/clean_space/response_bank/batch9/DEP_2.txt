For 
Let's apply the specified steps for **Identifying Defective Arguments Application (IDAA)** to the provided argument:

### Argument:
"Speaker 1: We are using thousands of people, who are going door to door to help us spread the word about social injustice and the need for change.
Speaker: Well then, I can’t be a part of this because I was always been taught that it’s wrong to use people."

### Step-by-Step Breakdown:

1. **Understand the Argument**:
   - **Proposition by Speaker 1**: Their organization is utilizing the collective effort of thousands of people to spread awareness about social injustice and advocate for change.
   - **Response from Speaker 2**: They refuse to participate because they believe it is intrinsically wrong to "use" people.

2. **Categorize the Defective Argument Type**:

   - **<G> (Generalization)**: No generalization of a general truth based on specific instances is apparent here.
   - **<FE> (False Enumeration)**: This does not involve listing limited or excessive options.
   - **<IR> (Inappropriate Reason)**: The reason given by Speaker 2 doesn't logically support their refusal. Speaker 2 interprets "using people" literally, ignoring the contextual meaning related to collective activism and voluntary efforts. Their reason isn't directly relevant to the context provided by Speaker 1. This fits the criteria of **<IR>**.
   - **<RR> (Redundant Reason)**: The response does not merely restate the proposition in different words.
   - **<WCB> (Weak Causal Basis)**: The causal link in terms of ethics and participation might be stretched, but it's not simply about weak substantiation.
   - **<FU> (False Universals)**: The response doesn't assert universally accepted points without proof.
   - **<DEP> (Double-Edged Phrases)**: The phrase by Speaker 2 might have dual interpretations, but it more accurately reflects an inappropriate application of ethical reasoning rather than ambiguously conflicting meanings.

### Conclusion:
The given argument has been evaluated against the criteria for various defective argument types. Based on the step-by-step analysis, the response from Speaker 2 fits most closely with **<IR> (Inappropriate Reason)**. The reason they provide does not logically support their refusal in the context of Speaker 1's proposition.

Thus, the identified defective argument type in the provided conversation is:

**<IR>**
