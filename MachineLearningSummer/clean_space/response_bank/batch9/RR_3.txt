For 
To apply the defined process of <IDAA> to the given argument, let's execute each step systematically:

### Step-by-Step Process:

1. **Read the Argument Statement**:
   - "Speaker 1: Jesus was not really crucified.
   - Speaker 2: How do I know that’s true?
   - Speaker 1: Because the Quran says so.
   - Speaker 2: How do I know the Quran is correct?
   - Speaker 1: Because the Quran is the Word of God, and everything it says is true.
   - Speaker 2: How do I know that’s true?
   - Speaker 1: Because God tells us so, here in the Koran."

2. **Determine the Core Proposition**:
   - The core proposition is that "Jesus was not really crucified."

3. **Identify Supporting Evidence**:
   - The supporting evidence provided revolves around the Quran as an authoritative source, stating that it is the Word of God and thus everything it says is true.

4. **Classify the Defective Argument Type**:
   - Match this to definitions:
     - **Generalization (<G>)**: Not applicable; no broad generalization.
     - **False Enumeration (<FE>)**: Not applicable; does not limit or extend options.
     - **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>)**: Applicable. The reasoning provided is that the Quran is true because it is the Word of God and then stating it is the Word of God is a circular argument. Moreover, claiming the authority of the Quran because God tells us so in the Quran emphasizes the circularity.
     - **Redundant Reason (<RR>)**: Partially applicable. The repetition that the Quran is true because it says so could be seen as a redundant reason, but this aspect is secondary to the circular reasoning.
     - **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: Not applicable; does not establish a causal connection.
     - **False Universals (<FU>)**: Not applicable; does not assert universally agreed points without proof.
     - **Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>)**: Not applicable; not using statements open to dual interpretations.

5. **Validate the Classification**:
   - The argument is fallacious primarily due to the circular reasoning provided in <IR>. The reasoning used to support the proposition relies on the assumption that the Quran is infallible without providing external validation.

6. **Document the Reasoning**:
   - The argument is classified under **Inappropriate Reason (IR)** because it uses circular reasoning to establish the truth value of the Quran and, consequently, the proposition about Jesus not being crucified.

7. **Cross-check for Overlapping Fallacies**:
   - While there is a hint of <RR> due to the repetitive nature of the argument, the primary issue is the relevance and appropriateness of the reasoning, which is best captured under <IR>.

### Conclusion:

In this case, the defective argument type identified is **Inappropriate Reason (IR)** due to the use of circular reasoning to support the proposition. This process confirms that the argument does not provide a valid foundation for the claim based on the logic and evidence presented.
