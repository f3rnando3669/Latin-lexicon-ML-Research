For 
To apply the decomposition of the task of identifying defective arguments (<IDAA>) to the given string, "People either like coffee or hate it," we will follow the defined steps:

### Steps (Application of <D> to <IDA>):

1. **Understand the Statement:**
   - The statement is: "People either like coffee or hate it."

2. **Identify Key Characteristics:**
   - The statement presents a dichotomy, suggesting that there are only two ways people can feel about coffee: they either like it or hate it.

3. **Match to a Defective Argument Type:**
   - This type of argument falls under the definition of **False Enumeration (<FE>)**, as it lists fewer options than actually exist. In reality, there are more nuanced feelings about coffee (e.g., indifference, occasional liking, etc.) that are not acknowledged by the statement.

4. **Confirm the Match:**
   - Upon reviewing the characteristics, the statement clearly fits <FE> because it falsely limits the options available regarding people's feelings about coffee.

5. **Record and Report:**
   - The defective argument type for the given string is **False Enumeration (<FE>)**.

Therefore, the defective argument type for "People either like coffee or hate it." is **False Enumeration (<FE>)**.
