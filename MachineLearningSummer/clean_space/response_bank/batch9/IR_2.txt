To apply the **Identify Defective Argument Application (IDAA)** process to the statement "In the race for mayor, Lara says a vote for her opponent will lead to you losing your job," let's go through the steps one by one:

### Steps for Decomposing the IDA Task:

1. **Read the Argument:**
   - Statement: "In the race for mayor, Lara says a vote for her opponent will lead to you losing your job."

2. **Identify the Core Proposition:**
   - Proposition: "Voting for Lara's opponent will lead to you losing your job."

3. **Analyze the Supporting Reason:**
   - Reason: The assertion is that the consequence of losing your job is directly tied to voting for her opponent.

4. **Match with Defective Argument Types:**
   - This argument seems to present a limited set of extreme outcomes (either you vote for Lara, or you lose your job) without considering other possibilities or providing a logical basis for the claim. 

5. **Select the Most Appropriate Type:**
   - This fits the pattern of **False Enumeration (FE)** because it presents a binary choice ignoring other possible consequences or factors that might influence one's job security.

Thus, applying **IDAA** to the given statement:

**Defective Argument Type:** False Enumeration (FE)
