### Decomposition of IDA (<D>):
1. **Reading and Understanding the Statement**:
   - Read the given statement carefully.
   - Understand the main proposition and the reason or evidence provided.

2. **Identifying the Core Proposition and Reasoning**:
   - Determine what is being claimed or proposed.
   - Identify the reason or evidence that supports this claim.

3. **Classifying the Argument**:
   - Compare the identified proposition and reasoning with the defined defective argument types (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>).
   - Match the reasoning or the logical structure of the statement to one of the predefined defective argument types.

4. **Validating the Classification**:
   - Ensure that the identified defective argument type accurately reflects the logical error in the statement.
   - Confirm that none of the other defective arguments fit better than the chosen one.

### Application to IDA (<IDAA>):
Let's apply these decomposed steps to the statement: "You either support Hillary Clinton for President or you don't believe in women's rights."

**Step 1: Reading and Understanding the Statement**
- Proposition: Support Hillary Clinton for President.
- Reasoning: Non-support implies not believing in women's rights.

**Step 2: Identifying the Core Proposition and Reasoning**
- Core Proposition: Supporting Hillary Clinton for President is necessary.
- Reason: Lack of support implies disbelief in women's rights, presenting a binary choice.

**Step 3: Classifying the Argument**
- This fits the category of False Enumeration (<FE>), as it lists only two options (supporting Hillary Clinton or not believing in women's rights) when more alternatives exist (e.g., one could believe in women's rights but support another candidate).

**Step 4: Validating the Classification**
- After reviewing, the provided options force a false dichotomy, failing to represent the full spectrum of possibilities. No other defective argument types fit better than <FE>.

Result: The argument type is <FE> (False Enumeration).
