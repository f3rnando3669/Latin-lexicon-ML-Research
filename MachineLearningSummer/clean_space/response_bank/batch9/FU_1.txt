For 
Let's apply the decomposition steps (<IDAA>) to the argument: "Get Verizon--1 billion people can't be wrong."

1. **Understanding the Argument**:
   - The argument is trying to persuade someone to choose Verizon as a service provider.

2. **Determine the Claim or Proposition**:
   - The claim is: "Get Verizon."

3. **Analyze Reasoning Provided**:
   - The reasoning given is: "1 billion people can't be wrong."

4. **Compare Reasoning to Defined Defective Argument Types**:
   - Generalization (<G>): Not applicable.
   - False Enumeration (<FE>): Not applicable.
   - Inappropriate Reason (<IR>): Not applicable.
   - Redundant Reason (<RR>): Not applicable.
   - Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>): Not applicable.
   - False Universals (<FU>): Potential match since it refers to a large number of people to validate the claim without actual evidence.
   - Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>): Not applicable.

5. **Identify Patterns**:
   - The argument uses the popularity of Verizon (1 billion people) as a reason to support its claim, assuming that because many people use it, it must be good. This fits the pattern of False Universals.

6. **Classify the Defective Argument**:
   - The argument is classified under False Universals (<FU>).

Therefore, the argument "Get Verizon--1 billion people can't be wrong." represents a <FU> defective argument type based on the steps outlined.
