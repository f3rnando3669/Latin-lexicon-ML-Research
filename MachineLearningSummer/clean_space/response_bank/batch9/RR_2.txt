To identify the type of defective argument in the string "We need to fix our broken judicial system by electing new people," let's follow the decomposed steps (<IDAA>):

### Step 1: Extract and Analyze the Argument
- **Main Proposition**: "We need to fix our broken judicial system."
- **Supporting Reasoning**: "by electing new people."

### Step 2: Compare with Definitions
- Let's compare the components of the argument with the definitions provided for each defective argument type:
  - **Generalization (<G>)**: The argument does not make a sweeping generalization based on a specific instance.
  - **False Enumeration (<FE>)**: The argument does not present limited options or exclude other possibilities.
  - **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>)**: The reasoning given ("by electing new people") needs further scrutiny as to whether it logically supports the proposition.
  - **Redundant Reason (<RR>)**: The argument does not appear to restate the proposition in different words.
  - **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The causal link between the need to fix the judicial system and electing new people may be a potential candidate as it's not inherently clear.
  - **False Universals (<FU>)**: The argument does not assert universally agreed points.
  - **Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>)**: The argument does not appear to use statements open to dual interpretations.

### Step 3: Identify Patterns or Keywords
- The argument hinges on the effect of one action ("elect new people") directly solving a complex issue ("broken judicial system"). This suggests a potential weakness in addressing the complexity of the problem with such a simplistic solution.

### Step 4: Contextual Interpretation
- Interpreting the context, the reasoning provided does not inherently address how electing new people will specifically resolve the issues in the judicial system. This implies a weak causal connection.

### Step 5: Final Identification
- Based on the analysis, the argument "We need to fix our broken judicial system by electing new people" shows a reasoning that is not compelling enough to fully support the proposition.

The logical fallacy represented here is <WCB> - Weak Causal Basis. The assertion that electing new people will fix the judicial system lacks a strong causal linkage and does not sufficiently explain how this action directly addresses the issue at hand.
