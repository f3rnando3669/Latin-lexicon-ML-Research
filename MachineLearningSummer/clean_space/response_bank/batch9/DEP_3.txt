For 
To apply the task of identifying defective argument (\<IDA\>) to the string provided ("I see nobody on the road," said Alice. "I only wish I had such eyes," the king remarked..."To be able to see Nobody! And at that distance, too! Why it's as much as I can do to see real people, by this light."), we will use the decomposition (\<D\>) approach step-by-step as outlined.

### Step-by-Step Process for \<IDAA\>

1. **Keyword Identification**:
   - Key phrases include: "I see nobody on the road," "To be able to see Nobody," "distance," "real people."

2. **Context Analysis**:
   - Alice states that she sees nobody on the road, meaning there is no one present. The king humorously misinterprets this statement to mean that Alice can literally see a person named "Nobody" from a distance, which he finds remarkable compared to his ability to see real people in dim light.

3. **Match Against Definitions**:
   - We need to match this against our list of defective argument types (\<G\>, \<FE\>, \<IR\>, \<RR\>, \<WCB\>, \<FU\>, \<DEP\>).

### Analysis and Matching:

- **Generalization (\<G\>)**: N/A - There’s no generalization based on a single instance.
- **False Enumeration (\<FE\>)**: N/A - There are no limited options presented.
- **Inappropriate Reason (\<IR\>)**: N/A - The reasoning here is more of a humorous misunderstanding rather than a logical reason supporting a proposition.
- **Redundant Reason (\<RR\>)**: N/A - There’s no redundant restatement of a proposition.
- **Weak Causal Basis (\<WCB\>)**: N/A - No causal relationship is presented.
- **False Universals (\<FU\>)**: N/A - No universal claims are asserted without proof.
- **Double-Edged Phrases (\<DEP\>)**: The king’s remark seems to fit this category. It is based on a dual interpretation of Alice's statement. She meant “nobody” as in no person, but the king took it to humorously mean a person named "Nobody."

### Step 4: Provide Reasoning
- The king's response uses the phrase "see Nobody" in a dual interpretation. This dual interpretation creates humorous ambiguity when he wishes he had eyes to see "Nobody" and struggles to see real people in his current light conditions. Thus, it fits the definition of **Double-Edged Phrases (\<DEP\>)**.

**Conclusion**:
The defective argument type for the sample string is **Double-Edged Phrases (\<DEP\>)**.
