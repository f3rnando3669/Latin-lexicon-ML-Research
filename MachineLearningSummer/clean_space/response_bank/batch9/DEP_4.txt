For 
Certainly! Let's apply the structured approach (<IDAA>) to identify the type of defective argument in the given string:

**Given String (<s>):** "It is immoral to kill an innocent human being. Fetuses are innocent human beings. Therefore, it is immoral to kill fetuses."

### Applying <D> to <<IDA>> (<IDAA>):

#### Step 1: Analyze the Given String
- Argument: The argument attempts to establish that killing fetuses is immoral by stating that fetuses are innocent human beings and that it is immoral to kill innocent human beings.

#### Step 2: Identify Key Phrases or Structure
- Key Phrases: "immoral to kill an innocent human being", "fetuses are innocent human beings", "therefore, it is immoral to kill fetuses".

#### Step 3: Compare with Known Templates
- **Generalization (<G>):** Claims a broad truth based on specific instances (e.g., all sports car drivers are too aggressive).
- **False Enumeration (<FE>):** Lists fewer or more options than actually exist (e.g., vote for Smith or live through years of higher taxes).
- **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>):** Provides a reason that doesn't logically support the proposition (e.g., don't you want the best for your baby?).
- **Redundant Reason (<RR>):** Essentially repeats the proposition in other words (e.g., smoking cigarettes is deadly because cigarettes can kill you).
- **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>):** Offers an insufficient reason to support the proposition (e.g., talking to a doctor alleviated a headache).
- **False Universals (<FU>):** Asserts universally agreed points without proof (e.g., everyone knows staying out in the rain can make you sick).
- **Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>):** Uses statements open to dual interpretations (e.g., making the yuletide gay).

#### Step 4: Determine the Match
- The argument is establishing a categorical moral framework by setting up two premises: it is immoral to kill innocent human beings and fetuses are innocent human beings, thus concluding that it is immoral to kill fetuses.
- The structure and reasoning presented here don't seem to fit the templates of generalization, false enumeration, inappropriate reason, weak causal basis, false universals, or double-edged phrases.
- The argument essentially restates the moral judgment (it is immoral to kill innocent human beings) by applying it to a specific case (fetuses). This falls into the category of **Redundant Reasoning (<RR>)**, where the conclusion merely reformulates the premise in different words.

#### Step 5: Output the Identified Type
- **Identified Defective Argument Type:** <RR> (Redundant Reason)

This concludes that the given string "It is immoral to kill an innocent human being. Fetuses are innocent human beings. Therefore, it is immoral to kill fetuses." is an example of a **Redundant Reason (<RR>)** argument type.
