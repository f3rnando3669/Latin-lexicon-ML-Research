For 
Let's apply the steps outlined for the application of decomposition to identify defective argument (<IDAA>) to the statement: "Every day, I eat cereal for breakfast. One time, I had a muffin instead, and there was a major earthquake in my city. I've eaten cereal ever since."

### Step-by-Step <IDAA> Application

1. **Identify the Statement**: 
   - The statement to be analyzed is: "Every day, I eat cereal for breakfast. One time, I had a muffin instead, and there was a major earthquake in my city. I've eaten cereal ever since."

2. **Compare with Definitions**: 
   - Compare the statement against the definitions and examples of each defective argument type:
     - **Generalization (<G>)**: The statement doesn't make a general claim based on a specific instance about a group of people or things.
     - **False Enumeration (<FE>)**: The statement doesn't list fewer or more options than actually exist.
     - **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>)**: The reason provided (eating cereal to prevent earthquakes) does not logically support the proposition.
     - **Redundant Reason (<RR>)**: The reason for eating cereal is not simply restating the proposition in other words.
     - **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The reason for the effect (eating a muffin causing an earthquake) is a weak or non-compelling reason.
     - **False Universals (<FU>)**: No universally agreed point is asserted without proof here.
     - **Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>)**: The statement is not open to dual interpretations that might work against the speaker.

3. **Classify**:
   - By matching the characteristics, the statement fits most closely with **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>)** because the presented causation (eating a muffin causing an earthquake) is not compelling or logical.

4. **Validate**:
   - Validate this classification by contrasting it with other examples of <WCB>:
     - Example from definition: "I had a real bad headache, then saw my doctor. Just by talking with him, my headache started to subside, and I was all better the next day. It was well worth the $200 visit fee."
     - Both examples suggest a weak, non-logical causal relationship.

5. **Result**:
   - The final output is that the defective argument type identified is **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>)**.

### Conclusion

The statement "Every day, I eat cereal for breakfast. One time, I had a muffin instead, and there was a major earthquake in my city. I've eaten cereal ever since." exemplifies a **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>)** because it suggests an implausible causal link between eating a muffin and a major earthquake occurring.
