For 
To apply <IDAA> to the given string, "In the four years that I have been marketing my new and improved brand of past-life regressive biocognitive astral-projective hyperaffective-hypnotic-teleological-metatherapy (buy ten sessions and the next one is free!), not one person has proved it is worthless or that I am unethical for providing a therapy I just made up one day when I realized that no one was referring clients to me anymore. That makes clear what a worthwhile therapy this is and how exceptionally ethical I am to provide it," we will follow the decomposition steps.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Read and Comprehend**:
   Carefully read the string and understand its full context.
   - The speaker claims that because no one has disproved the value or ethics of their therapy, it must be valid and ethical.

2. **Identify Argument Components**:
   - Proposition: The therapy is worthwhile and ethical.
   - Reason: No one has proven it is worthless or unethical.

3. **Compare with Defined Fallacies**:
   Compare the argument components with the definitions of the defective argument types:
   - **Generalization (<G>)**: Claiming a general truth based on a specific instance (not applicable here).
   - **False Enumeration (<FE>)**: Listing fewer or more options than actually exist (not applicable here).
   - **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>)**: Providing a reason that does not logically support the proposition.
   - **Redundant Reason (<RR>)**: Saying the same thing as the proposition but in other words (not applicable here).
   - **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: Offering a reason that is not compelling enough to support the proposition.
   - **False Universals (<FU>)**: Asserting universally agreed points without proof (partially applicable as it uses an appeal to ignorance).
   - **Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>)**: Using statements open to dual interpretations (not applicable here).

4. **Match the Argument to a Fallacy Type**:
   - The argument fits **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>)** because the reason provided (no one has disproved the therapy’s worth or ethics) does not logically support the proposition that the therapy is therefore worthwhile and ethical. It employs an appeal to ignorance, suggesting that the lack of disproof is itself proof of the argument’s validity.

5. **Conclude and Report**:
   - Conclusion: The defective argument type is **<IR> (Inappropriate Reason)**.

### Conclusion

The given string uses **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>)** as its defective argument type, where the speaker’s reasoning that "no one has disproved the therapy" does not logically support the claim that the therapy is therefore worthwhile and ethical.
