For 
Let's apply **IDAA** to identify the type of defective argument in the given string: "The reason Donald Trump got elected was because liberals took political correctness too far."

### Step-by-Step Process (D) for IDA:

1. **Understand the Proposition**:
   - The proposition here implies that Donald Trump's election is a result that needs an explanation.

2. **Identify the Argument**:
   - The argument provided is that Trump's election was due to liberals taking political correctness too far.

3. **Classify the Defective Argument**:
   - We need to compare the argument to our list of defective argument types (G, FE, IR, RR, WCB, FU, DEP).

### Analysis:

**Generalization (G)**:
- This argument does not claim a general truth based on a specific instance.

**False Enumeration (FE)**:
- This argument does not present a limited or excessive list of options.

**Inappropriate Reason (IR)**:
- This argument provides a reason (liberals took political correctness too far) which is not necessarily logically connected to the outcome (Donald Trump getting elected). It suggests a causal relationship that may not be adequately substantiated.

**Redundant Reason (RR)**:
- This argument is not merely rephrasing the proposition.

**Weak Causal Basis (WCB)**:
- This argument does suggest a cause (liberals taking political correctness too far) that may not be compelling or adequately support the proposition. However, the focus would be on the "weakness" of the causal link rather than its inappropriateness.

**False Universals (FU)**:
- This argument does not assert universally agreed points without proof.

**Double-Edged Phrases (DEP)**:
- This argument does not seem to use statements open to dual interpretations against the speaker.

### Conclusion:

The primary issue here is the logical connection between the reason provided and the proposition. The argument provided ("liberals took political correctness too far") does not logically or adequately explain the outcome ("Donald Trump got elected"). Thus, this best fits the category of **Inappropriate Reason (IR)** since it provides a reason that doesn't logically support the proposition.

**Outcome**:
   - The defective argument type for the string "The reason Donald Trump got elected was because liberals took political correctness too far." is **Inappropriate Reason (IR)**.
