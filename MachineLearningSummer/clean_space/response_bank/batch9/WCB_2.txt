### Application of \( IDAA \) to "Farmer McDonald: Ever since they put up that new power plant across the river, we haven't had a bit of rain. I'm tellin' you, mankind has got too big for its britches when it fiddles around with nature."

Let's apply the steps \( (D) \) to break down and identify the argument type.

#### Step-by-step Analysis:

1. **Understand the Argument**: 
   - **Proposition**: "Mankind has got too big for its britches when it fiddles around with nature."
   - **Reason Provided**: "Ever since they put up that new power plant across the river, we haven't had a bit of rain."

2. **Classify the Proposition**: 
   - The proposition suggests a causal relationship between building the power plant and the lack of rain. This could hint at a weak causal connection or inappropriate reasoning.

3. **Match Against Definitions**: 
   - We need to compare the argument with the provided defective argument types. This includes:
     - **Generalization (G)**
     - **False Enumeration (FE)**
     - **Inappropriate Reason (IR)**
     - **Redundant Reason (RR)**
     - **Weak Causal Basis (WCB)**
     - **False Universals (FU)**
     - **Double-Edged Phrases (DEP)**

4. **Identify Logical Structure**: 
   - The logical structure provided by Farmer McDonald is:
     - Power plant construction → No rain.
     - This appears to assert a direct cause and effect without substantial evidence.

5. **Check Examples**: 
   - Let’s check examples specifically related to causation assertions:
     - **Weak Causal Basis (WCB)**: "I had a real bad headache, then saw my doctor. Just by talking with him, my headache started to subside, and I was all better the next day. It was well worth the $200 visit fee."
   - The provided example for WCB closely matches our argument's structure.

6. **Determine the Argument Type**: 
   - The argument suggests a weak causal relationship between the power plant's construction and no rain, similar to concluding cause-effect based on coincidental timing.

7. **Review and Confirm**: 
   - Re-evaluating the argument steps and comparisons with the example, it confirms that the argument rests on a weak causal basis without robust evidence for the causation claim.

Result: The argument represents the "<WCB>" defective argument type—Weak Causal Basis.
