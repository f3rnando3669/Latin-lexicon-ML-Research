Certainly, let's apply the decomposition process to identify the type of defective argument in the given string.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition of <IDA> Applied to the Given String:

**Given String (Argument <s>):**
"Perhaps the most classic example of this fallacy is the argument for the existence of God. Due to the understanding of nature through science, many of the arguments that used to be used for God (or gods) were abandoned, only to be replaced with new ones, usually involving questions to which science has not definitively answered yet. The move from creationism to intelligent design is a prime example. Currently the origin of life is a popular argument for God (although a classic argument from ignorance), and an area where we very well may have a scientific answer in the next decade, at which time, the “origin of life” argument will fade away and be replaced by another, thus moving the figurative goalposts farther back as our understanding of the natural world increases.Exception: This fallacy should not be confused with an argument or set of arguments, with multiple propositions inherent in the argument. The reason for the difference between this kind of argument and the moving the goalposts fallacy, is a subtle one, but indicated by a strong initial claim (“has to be”, “must”, “required for”, etc.) that gets answered and/or what appears to be ad hoc objections that follow eventually leading to an impossible request for proof.
Fun Fact: The name “moving the goalposts” comes from the analogy of kicking a perfect field goal in American football, only to have the goalposts be moved on you. This would be very unfair.

#### Step 1: Input Analysis
- **Input:** The argument provided discusses "moving the goalposts" and provides context and examples.

#### Step 2: Classify Statement
- The nature of the statement involves the behavior of changing arguments or criteria when a specific point has been tackled, often found in debates or discussions.

#### Step 3: Match Against Defective Argument Types
- **Generalization (<G>):** Doesn't seem to fit as it's not claiming a general truth based on a specific instance.
- **False Enumeration (<FE>):** Doesn't seem to fit as it's not listing false options.
- **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>):** Doesn't seem to fit as it doesn't provide irrelevant reasoning.
- **Redundant Reason (<RR>):** Doesn't seem to state the same thing differently.
- **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>):** Doesn't offer a weak reason, it's more about shifting criteria.
- **False Universals (<FU>):** Doesn't assert universally agreed points without proof.
- **Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>):** Doesn't seem to use phrases open to dual interpretations.

None of the predefined defective argument types match directly with the behavior of "moving the goalposts."

#### Step 4: Identify and Label
- The provided text actually identifies "moving the goalposts" itself as a fallacy which doesn't directly map to the defined defective argument types but explains a separate logical fallacy.

#### Step 5: Output
- The detected fallacy in the text is "moving the goalposts," but this doesn't fit directly into the predefined defective argument types in this context. 

### Result
The provided string describes an instance of the "moving the goalposts" fallacy, which is not directly described by the predefined types (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>). If this were a different system with broader classifications, the identifier could better match "moving the goalposts" to its appropriate category.

Hence, in our defined context, this provided argument does not fit into any of the specified defective argument types **<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>**. It is a distinct logical fallacy known as "moving the goalposts."
