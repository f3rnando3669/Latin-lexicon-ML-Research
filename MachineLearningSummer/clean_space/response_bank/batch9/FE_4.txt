For 
To apply IDAA to the string "I thought you were a good person, but you weren’t in class today," we'll follow the decomposition steps laid out:

1. **Understand the Argument in \( s \)**:
   - **Proposition:** The person being addressed is not a good person.
   - **Supporting Reason:** They were not in class today.

2. **Identify the Key Indicators of the Argument Types**:
   - **Generalization (<G>):** Is the claim of not being a good person based on a single instance of not being in class today?
   - **False Enumeration (<FE>):** Are fewer or more options than exist being listed?
   - **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>):** Is the reason given (not being in class) logically supporting the proposition (being a good or bad person)?
   - **Redundant Reason (<RR>):** Does the reason repeat the proposition in other words?
   - **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>):** Is the reason (not being in class) not compelling enough to support the proposition?
   - **False Universals (<FU>):** Are universally agreed points being asserted without proof?
   - **Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>):** Are the phrases open to dual interpretations?

3. **Match Against Known Defective Argument Types**:
   - **Generalization (<G>):** Does the argument generalize the person's character based on a specific instance? Yes, it's concluding that someone is not a good person just because they weren't in class once.
   - **False Enumeration (<FE>):** Not applicable here.
   - **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>):** The logic connecting "missing class" to "not being a good person" is flawed, indicating that the reason does not logically support the proposition.
   - **Redundant Reason (<RR>):** Not applicable here.
   - **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>):** The causal link between not being in class and not being a good person appears weak and not compelling.
   - **False Universals (<FU>):** Not applicable here.
   - **Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>):** Not applicable here.

4. **Execute IDA by Applying the Definitions**:
   - The argument appears to fit well under **Generalization (<G>)**, as it makes a broad claim about a person’s character based on a single instance.
   - It also fits **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>)**, since not being in class is not a sufficient reason to conclude someone is not a good person.
   - Lastly, it fits **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>)** because the causal relationship between missing class and good character is weak.

5. **Validate the Identification**:
   - Both <G> and <IR> accurately reflect the types of defective argument in the statement.
   - Given that the main issue is making a broad judgment based on a single specific instance, **Generalization (<G>)** stands out as the primary defective argument type for this statement.
   - However, the logical flaw in reasoning (<IR>) and weakness of the causal link (<WCB>) further validate the problematic nature of the argument.

Thus, the statement "I thought you were a good person, but you weren’t in class today" primarily represents the defective argument type **Generalization (<G>)**, with elements of **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>)** and **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>)**.
