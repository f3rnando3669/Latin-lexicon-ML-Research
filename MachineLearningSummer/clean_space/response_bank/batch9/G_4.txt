Certainly! Let's apply the decomposed steps (<IDAA>) to identify the type of defective argument for the given string:

Argument <s>: "Three kids in one class failed the Jane Eyre quiz, I guess, all the other classes will all fail it, too."

### Decomposition Steps (<D>) for Identifying Defective Argument Types (<IDAA>):

1. **Comprehension Phase:**
   - **Step 1:** Read the argument "Three kids in one class failed the Jane Eyre quiz, I guess, all the other classes will all fail it, too."
   - **Step 2:** Identify the main assertion: "All the other classes will fail the Jane Eyre quiz."

2. **Pattern Recognition Phase:**
   - **Step 3:** Note phrases like "Three kids in one class failed the Jane Eyre quiz" and "all the other classes will all fail it, too."
   - **Step 4:** Recognize the structure of the argument: a specific instance (three kids failing) is used to make a broad prediction (all other classes will fail).

3. **Evaluation Phase:**
   - **Step 5:** Evaluate reasons or evidence provided: the failure of three kids in one class.
   - **Step 6:** There’s no enumeration of options.
   - **Step 7:** Consider if the reason logically supports the conclusion: Does the failure of three kids logically imply all other classes will fail? No.
   - **Step 8:** The assertion isn’t redundant but overgeneralizes from a specific instance.
   - **Step 9:** No causal explanation is provided.
   - **Step 10:** The argument implies a universal prediction based on a small, specific instance.
   - **Step 11:** No dual interpretation is possible.

4. **Decision Phase:**
   - **Step 12:** The argument fits the type <G> (Generalization) because it takes a specific case (three kids failing) and makes a broad prediction (all other classes will fail).
   - **Step 13:** Confirm that the argument is indeed an example of a generalization.

### Conclusion
The argument <s> "Three kids in one class failed the Jane Eyre quiz, I guess, all the other classes will all fail it, too." is classified as:
<G> (Generalization).

By following the decomposed steps, we have identified the type of defective argument used in the given string.
