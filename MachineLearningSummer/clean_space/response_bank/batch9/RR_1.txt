For 
To apply the steps of <IDAA> to the argument "Paranormal activity is real because I have experienced what can only be described as paranormal activity," let's follow the decomposition steps:

**1. Extract Argument**:
The argument is: "Paranormal activity is real because I have experienced what can only be described as paranormal activity."

**2. Classify the Argument**:
Let's check each potential defective argument type one by one:

- **Generalization (<G>)**: Is this a broad claim based on limited instances?
  - The argument asserts the reality of paranormal activity based on a personal experience. It somewhat generalizes from a single instance, but it may not fit the strict definition of generalization where a broad, sweeping judgment is made about a group or category.

- **False Enumeration (<FE>)**: Does it list fewer or more options than actually exist?
  - It does not provide a choice between limited options or falsely enumerate possibilities.

- **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>)**: Is the reason provided logically supportive of the proposition?
  - The reason ("I have experienced what can only be described as paranormal activity") does not logically support the universal claim that all paranormal activity is real. It provides a personal, anecdotal experience rather than objective evidence.

- **Redundant Reason (<RR>)**: Does the reason restate the proposition without adding new information?
  - Yes, the reason simply reiterates the claim using different words without providing independent evidence or support. The statement "I have experienced what can only be described as paranormal activity" is another way of saying "Paranormal activity is real."

- **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: Is the reason not compelling enough to support the proposition?
  - The argument does indeed offer a personal experience that may not be compelling enough to prove the universal claim, but it is more clearly a redundant reason.

- **False Universals (<FU>)**: Does it assert universally agreed points without proof?
  - No, the argument does not assert universally agreed points but rather makes a specific claim.

- **Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>)**: Are there statements open to dual interpretations?
  - No, the argument does not present any statements that can be interpreted in two different ways.

**3. Compare with Examples**:
The argument "Paranormal activity is real because I have experienced what can only be described as paranormal activity" closely resembles the examples of <RR> (Redundant Reason), where the reason merely restates the proposition without added evidence.

**4. Identify**: 
The argument is most accurately identified as <RR> (Redundant Reason).

**5. Justify**:
The proposition "Paranormal activity is real" is restated as "I have experienced what can only be described as paranormal activity" without providing new information or independent evidence. This lacks the necessary logical support to prove the claim and instead mirrors the initial assertion in different wording.

Thus, by applying <IDAA> to the argument "Paranormal activity is real because I have experienced what can only be described as paranormal activity," we identify it as a Redundant Reason (<RR>).
