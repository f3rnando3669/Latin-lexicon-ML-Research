Sure, let's apply the decomposition process <D> to the statement mentioned:

**Statement:** "The museum's new gemstones and precious minerals exhibit needs more security guards. If you don't agree, then you must be planning to steal a piece of the exhibit."

### Decomposition of the Task (IDAA):

**Step 1: Read and Understand the Argument**
- The proposition is that the exhibit needs more security guards.
- The argument is structured to suggest that disagreeing with this proposition implies an intention to steal from the exhibit.

**Step 2: Identify the Type of Statement**
- This statement provides two choices: agree with the proposition or be accused of having a criminal intent.

**Step 3: Match with Defective Argument Definitions**
- Let's compare with the definitions:
  - <G>: This is not claiming a general truth based on a specific instance.
  - <IR>: No inappropriate reason is directly given.
  - <RR>: The statement isn't saying the same thing in other words.
  - <WCB>: The reason provided is not weak but rather coercive.
  - <FU>: Not asserting a universally agreed point without proof.
  - <DEP>: No dual interpretation present.
  - <FE>: This matches <FE> (False Enumeration) by presenting a false dichotomy: either the exhibit needs more guards, or you intend to steal.

**Step 4: Validate the Categorization**
- The argument lists fewer options than truly exist (it excludes other reasons one might disagree with needing more guards). It falsely limits the choices to agreeing with the proposition or having malicious intent.

Thus, the statement "The museum's new gemstones and precious minerals exhibit needs more security guards. If you don't agree, then you must be planning to steal a piece of the exhibit." is identified as **<FE> (False Enumeration)** because it presents a false dichotomy and limits the options to an unreasonable extent.
