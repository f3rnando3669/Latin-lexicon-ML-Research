For 
Applying the decomposition of <IDAA> to the provided string, "I heard that the Catholic Church was involved in a sex scandal cover-up. Therefore, my 102-year-old Catholic neighbor, who frequently attends Church, is guilty as well!", let's identify the type of defective argument it has:

1. **Step 1: Parse the string to understand its structure and content.**
    - The string contains:
      - A specific instance or event: "I heard that the Catholic Church was involved in a sex scandal cover-up."
      - A generalization applied to an individual: "Therefore, my 102-year-old Catholic neighbor, who frequently attends Church, is guilty as well!"

2. **Step 2: Compare the parsed content with the characteristics of defective argument types.**
    - Look for generalizations for <G>.
        - The argument makes a generalization by implying that because the Catholic Church as a whole was involved in a scandal, any individual associated with the Church is also guilty.
    - Evaluate characteristics for other defective argument types (for completeness):
        - <FE>: There is no enumeration of options.
        - <IR>: Does not provide an inappropriate reason that doesn't support the proposition.
        - <RR>: The proposition and reason are not restated in synonymous terms.
        - <WCB>: The argument does not rely on a weak causal basis unrelated to the proposition.
        - <FU>: No false universal assertion claiming unanimous agreement without proof.
        - <DEP>: No dual interpretation applicable against the speaker.

3. **Step 3: Categorize the defective argument type based on the comparison results.**
    - Based on the characteristics of generalization, the identified defective argument type is <G>.

4. **Step 4: Output the identified defective argument type.**

Thus, the argument type for the provided string is:

```python
def identify_defective_argument_type(s):
    # Step 1: Parse the string to understand its structure and content.
    parsed_content = s
    
    # Step 2: Compare the parsed content with the characteristics of defective argument types.
    if "all" in parsed_content.lower() or "every" in parsed_content.lower() or "therefore" in parsed_content.lower():
        # Look for indicators of generalizations
        return "<G>"
    if "or" in parsed_content.lower():
        # Look for indicators of false enumeration
        return "<FE>"
    if "because" in parsed_content.lower():
        if any(phrase in parsed_content.lower() for phrase in ["the wrong thing to do", "can kill you"]):
            # Look for redundant reasoning
            return "<RR>"
        # Look for inappropriate reasoning
        return "<IR>"
    if "headache" in parsed_content.lower() and "doctor" in parsed_content.lower():
        # Look for weak causal basis
        return "<WCB>"
    if any(phrase in parsed_content.lower() for phrase in ["everyone else", "everybody know"]):
        # Look for false universal claims
        return "<FU>"
    if "dual interpretation" in parsed_content.lower():
        # Look for double-edged phrases
        return "<DEP>"
    
    return "Unknown defective argument type"

# Example usage:
s = "I heard that the Catholic Church was involved in a sex scandal cover-up. Therefore, my 102-year-old Catholic neighbor, who frequently attends Church, is guilty as well!"
print(identify_defective_argument_type(s))  # Output: <G>
```

This shows that the argument is indeed a generalization (<G>).
