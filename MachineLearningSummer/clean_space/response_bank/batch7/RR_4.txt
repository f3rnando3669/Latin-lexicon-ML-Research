For 
Let's apply the outlined steps of **<IDAA>** to analyze and identify the defective argument type in the string "That restaurant is popular because everyone in town goes there."

### Applying **<IDAA>**:
1. **Read and Understand the Argument**:
   - "That restaurant is popular because everyone in town goes there."

2. **Identify the Key Components**:
   - **Proposition**: "That restaurant is popular."
   - **Reasoning**: "Because everyone in town goes there."

3. **Classify the Argument**: Determine which type of defective argument this best fits.
   - **<G>**: Not applicable since it doesn't generalize from a specific instance.
   - **<FE>**: Not focusing on enumerating options.
   - **<IR>**: The reasoning seems to support the proposition.
   - **<RR>**: The reasoning appears to be restating the proposition in other terms.
   - **<WCB>**: Doesn't involve weak causal reasoning.
   - **<FU>**: Doesnâ€™t assert universally agreed points without proof.
   - **<DEP>**: No dual interpretations open against the speaker.

4. **Verify the Classification**:
   - The reason "everyone in town goes there" is essentially restating the idea that the restaurant is popular, hence the same idea is being reiterated in different words.

5. **Output the Conclusion**:
   - The argument type is **<RR>** (Redundant Reason).

Therefore, the string "That restaurant is popular because everyone in town goes there" fits the **<RR>** (Redundant Reason) category.
