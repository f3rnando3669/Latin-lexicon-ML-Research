For 
Let's apply the steps of <IDAA> to the provided string:

String <s>:
"One of our clients doubled their conversions after changing all their landing page text to bright red. Therefore, changing all text to red is a proven way to double conversions."

### Decomposition of Task (D) into Steps for <IDA> applied to the string:

1. **Read the String:**
   - "One of our clients doubled their conversions after changing all their landing page text to bright red. Therefore, changing all text to red is a proven way to double conversions."

2. **Identify the Claim or Proposition:**
   - Proposition: "Changing all text to red is a proven way to double conversions."

3. **Analyze Supporting Reasons:**
   - Reason Given: "One of our clients doubled their conversions after changing all their landing page text to bright red."

4. **Match the Pattern:**
   - Compare this statement to the definitions of defective argument types:
     - **Generalization (<G>):** It claims a general truth ("changing all text to red is a proven way to double conversions") based on a specific instance ("one of our clients doubled their conversions").
     - Other types (<FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>) do not appear to fit as closely based on the given definitions.

5. **Classify the Defective Argument:**
   - This string fits the pattern of **Generalization (<G>)** since it makes a broad claim based on a single instance.

6. **Document the Findings:**
   - Output: <G>

### Conclusion
The defective argument type for the string "One of our clients doubled their conversions after changing all their landing page text to bright red. Therefore, changing all text to red is a proven way to double conversions." is identified as <G> (Generalization).
