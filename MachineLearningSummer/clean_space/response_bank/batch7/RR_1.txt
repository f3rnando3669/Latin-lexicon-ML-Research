For 
Let's apply the task of identifying the type of defective argument \(<s>\) represents by utilizing the \(IDAA\) methodology:

### Understanding the Argument \(s\):

#### Argument:
"Paranormal activity is real because I have experienced what can only be described as paranormal activity."

1. **Understand the Argument:**
   - Proposition: Paranormal activity is real.
   - Reason provided: Because the speaker has experienced something that they describe as paranormal activity.

2. **Classify the Argument Type:**
   - Examine the statement closely for any of the possible defective argument types:
   
     - **Generalization (<G>)**: This argument is not making a broad claim based on a specific instance but rather is concluding the reality of paranormal activity based on a singular personal experience.
     - **False Enumeration (<FE>)**: This argument does not involve presenting a limited set of options.
     - **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>)**: This argument is not providing a reason that is completely unrelated but seems to provide a reason that is redundant.
     - **Redundant Reason (<RR>)**: This argument might fall under this category as it essentially claims "paranormal activity is real because I experienced paranormal activity," which is a form of circular reasoning where the reason does not provide new evidence.
     - **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: This argument does not directly link an event to cause, but the reason given is more about experience validation.
     - **False Universals (<FU>)**: This argument does not assert agreed points without proof universally.
     - **Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>)**: This argument does not utilize statements open to dual interpretations against the speaker.

3. **Determine the Defective Nature:**
   - The argument provided fits the definition of **<RR>** (Redundant Reason) as it essentially repeats the proposition without giving a new reason that logically supports the claim independently.

4. **Label the Argument:**
   - Argument type: <RR>

5. **Confirm the Classification:**
   - Yes, it accurately meets the criteria for **<RR>**. The argument is circular, repeating the claim in different words without offering new evidence.

### Conclusion:
By following these steps systematically, we classify the argument "Paranormal activity is real because I have experienced what can only be described as paranormal activity." as a **Redundant Reason (<RR>)**.
