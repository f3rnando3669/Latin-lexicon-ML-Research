For 
To apply <IDAA> to the given statement "In the race for mayor, Lara says a vote for her opponent will lead to you losing your job. What fallacy has she committed?", we will decompose the task of identifying the type of defective argument using the outlined steps.

### Decomposition of <IDA> Task

#### Step 1: Read and Understand the Argument
Carefully read the provided string:
- **Main Proposition**: Voting for Lara's opponent will lead to losing your job.

#### Step 2: Identify Key Elements
Identify the specific elements in the argument:
- **Enumeration**: The argument seems to imply a binary choice with severe consequences (voting for Laraâ€™s opponent leads to job loss).
- **Relevance**: Consider whether the reason logically supports the main proposition.

#### Step 3: Match the Argument to Defective Types
Based on the identification:
- This statement presents a binary choice: either vote for Lara or lose your job. The argument does not explore other possibilities or provide logical reasoning as to why a vote for the opponent inevitably leads to job loss.
- It lists fewer options than actually exist (there could be other reasons influencing job security not related to voting for a mayoral candidate).

This type of argument falls under:
- **False Enumeration (<FE>)**

#### Step 4: Confirm and Conclude
Double-check the identified type:
- The argument matches the characteristics of False Enumeration. It presents a false dichotomy by suggesting that only two outcomes are possible and doesn't explore a broader or more logical range of consequences.

### Conclusion
The fallacy committed in the argument "In the race for mayor, Lara says a vote for her opponent will lead to you losing your job." is **False Enumeration (<FE>)**.
