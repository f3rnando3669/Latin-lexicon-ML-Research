For 
To identify the type of defective argument in the given string using the decomposition approach (\<IDAA\>), let's follow the steps outlined earlier:

### Given String:
"The museum's new gemstones and precious minerals exhibit needs more security guards. If you don't agree, then you must be planning to steal a piece of the exhibit."

### Step-by-Step Decomposition:

1. **Parsing the Argument**:
    - Proposition: "The museum's new gemstones and precious minerals exhibit needs more security guards."
    - Implication: "If you don't agree, then you must be planning to steal a piece of the exhibit."

2. **Identifying Keywords and Phrases**:
    - Keywords: "needs more security guards", "don't agree", "planning to steal"

3. **Classifying based on Definitions**:
    - The string sets up a false dichotomy: it implies that there are only two choices â€“ either one agrees with increased security or one is planning to steal.

4. **Matching and Verification**:
    - This closely aligns with the definition of **False Enumeration (\<FE\>)**, which lists fewer options than actually exist. The argument forces a binary choice when multiple possibilities exist.

5. **Final Identification**:
    - The argument in this string is best classified as **False Enumeration (\<FE\>)**.

### Conclusion:
By systematically applying the decomposition process (\<IDAA\>), we have determined that the defective argument type in the given string is **False Enumeration (\<FE\>)**. The argument wrongly restricts the options to either agreeing with more security guards or being a potential thief, omitting other reasonable perspectives.
