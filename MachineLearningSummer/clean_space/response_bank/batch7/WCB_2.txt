To apply **IDAA** to the statement:

"Farmer McDonald: Ever since they put up that new power plant across the river, we haven't had a bit of rain. I'm tellin' you, mankind has got too big for its britches when it fiddles around with nature."

we will break down the task into defined specific steps:

### Step 1: Read and Understand the Statement (s)
- Carefully read the given statement to capture its context.
- The statement claims a lack of rain since a power plant was put up and suggests a causal relationship between the two events. The speaker then generalizes about mankind's actions.

### Step 2: Identify Key Components
- The key components in the statement are:
  - Lack of rain since the power plant was established.
  - The suggestion that mankind's actions are disrupting nature.
  - The implicit causal link between the power plant and the lack of rain.

### Step 3: Compare to Definitions
- **Generalization (<G>)**: Not strongly evident as it does not generalize based on specific instances but rather infers a specific instance to a broader situation.
- **False Enumeration (<FE>)**: Not applicable as there is no false dichotomy or limited listing of options.
- **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>)**: Not evident as the main argument does not feature an illogical reason unrelated to the proposition.
- **Redundant Reason (<RR>)**: Not applicable since the statement doesn't restate its proposition but uses a seemingly logical association.
- **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The statement provides a reason (new power plant causing no rain) that is not compelling or scientifically supported to suggest such an effect.
- **False Universals (<FU>)**: Mildly present, as there is a general assertion without proof but it’s secondary to the main issue.
- **Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>)**: Not applicable, since the statement doesn’t highlight a dual interpretation that contradicts the speaker.

### Step 4: Determine Argument Type
- The most fitting defective argument type is **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>)** given that the statement claims a lack of rain is caused by the new power plant without strong supporting evidence.

### Step 5: Confirm or Refine With Examples
- This matches well with provided examples under **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>)**, such as attributing an earthquake to a specific breakfast choice or a single individual’s responsibility for school-wide performance issues.

Hence, the statement "Farmer McDonald: Ever since they put up that new power plant across the river, we haven't had a bit of rain. I'm tellin' you, mankind has got too big for its britches when it fiddles around with nature." falls under **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>)**.
