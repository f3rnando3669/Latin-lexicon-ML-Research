### Application of IDAA to "People either like coffee or hate it."

Let's decompose the task of identifying the defective argument in the given string using the steps we've defined.

1. **Understand the Proposition (<s>)**:
    - **Step 1.1**: Read the entire string (<s>) and identify the main claim or statement being made.
      - The proposition is: "People either like coffee or hate it."
    - **Step 1.2**: Look for any qualifiers or specific instances cited in the proposition.
      - There are no specific instances or qualifiers; the statement broadly categorizes people's preferences.

2. **Identify the Reason**:
    - **Step 2.1**: Extract the supporting reason or evidence provided in the proposition.
      - The proposition does not provide a reason; it asserts a dichotomy.
    - **Step 2.2**: Note the relationship between the claim and the reason.
      - The relationship is an all-or-nothing claim without supporting evidence.

3. **Match with Defective Argument Types**:
    - **Generalization (<G>)**:
        - **Step 3.1.1**: Check if the claim is making a broad generalization based on limited instances.
          - Not applicable; it's not a generalization but a dichotomy.
    - **False Enumeration (<FE>)**:
        - **Step 3.2.1**: Check if the claim artificially limits the options to fewer or more than actually exist.
          - **Applicable**: The claim limits people's preferences to two extreme options: liking or hating coffee, ignoring the possibility of neutral feelings or other complexities.
    - **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>)**:
        - **Step 3.3.1**: Check if the reason provided does not logically support the proposition.
          - Not applicable; no reason/evidence is given, just a statement.
    - **Redundant Reason (<RR>)**:
        - **Step 3.4.1**: Check if the reason given is just a restatement of the claim.
          - Not applicable; no reason is given.
    - **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>)**:
        - **Step 3.5.1**: Check if the reason is not strong enough to support the claim.
          - Not applicable; no causal reasoning involved.
    - **False Universals (<FU>)**:
        - **Step 3.6.1**: Check if the claim asserts universally accepted points without proof.
          - Not applicable; it's a dichotomy, not a universally accepted point.
    - **Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>)**:
        - **Step 3.7.1**: Check if the statement can be interpreted in two ways, potentially against the speaker.
          - Not applicable; the statement is straightforward in its dichotomy.

4. **Verify Classification**:
    - **Step 4.1**: Compare the identified defective argument type against the detailed characteristics of the type.
      - The identified type is **False Enumeration (<FE>)**.
      - The statement fits the characteristic of <FE> because it lists only two options (like or hate) for people's preferences toward coffee, ignoring other possibilities.
    - **Step 4.2**: Ensure that the identification is accurate by cross-checking with multiple examples if necessary.
      - Cross-checking confirms this is similar to other false dichotomies (e.g., "You are either with us or against us.").

### Conclusion
The defective argument type in the given string "People either like coffee or hate it." is **False Enumeration (<FE>)**.
