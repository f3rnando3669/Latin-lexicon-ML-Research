For 
To apply the decomposition approach (<D>) to the task of identifying the type of defective argument (<IDA>) in the given string <s>, we'll follow the specific steps outlined:

### Given String <s>
"My best friend says you’re a liar, so I’m not going to talk to you."

### Step-by-Step Breakdown:
1. **Step 1: Analyze the Argument Structure**
   - **Main Proposition:** "I’m not going to talk to you."
   - **Supporting Statement:** "My best friend says you’re a liar."

2. **Step 2: Categorize the Argument Type**
   - Evaluate the supporting statement to determine if it logically supports the main proposition.

3. **Step 3: Identify Keywords and Phrases**
   - Keywords and phrases to look out for in this statement include "My best friend says", which suggests reliance on someone else's opinion without providing concrete evidence.

4. **Step 4: Confirm the Argument Type**
   - The argument relies heavily on the opinion of someone else ("My best friend says") without providing substantial evidence or independent reasoning.

This kind of reasoning doesn't fit neatly into **Generalization (<G>)** because it’s not making a broad claim based on a specific instance, nor does it fit into **False Enumeration (<FE>)**, **Redundant Reason (<RR>)**, **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>)**, or **Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>)**.

Upon closer examination, the argument primarily relies on an accepted authority without proof, which aligns with **False Universals (<FU>)**. These arguments often include references to what everyone thinks or what is commonly accepted without providing proper evidence.

### Conclusion
The identified defective argument type for the given string <s> is **<FU> (False Universals)**, as it asserts a point based on an unproven assumption or assertion from a trusted source.
