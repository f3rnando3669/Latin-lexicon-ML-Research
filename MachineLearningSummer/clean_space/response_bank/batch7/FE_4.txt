For 
Sure, let's apply the steps of <IDAA> to the given argument:

**String (<s>):** "I thought you were a good person, but you weren’t in class today."

**Steps (Decomposition <D>):**

1. **Identify the Nature of the Claim:**
   - The statement makes a judgment about someone’s character based on a specific action (not being in class).

2. **Compare with Defined Argument Types:**
   - **<G> (Generalization):** Claims a general truth based on a specific instance.
     - Not quite, because this is not about a general truth but about a judgment on a single person.
   - **<FE> (False Enumeration):** Lists fewer or more options than actually exist.
     - Yes, this applies because it implies that being in class is the sole measure of being a good person.
   - **<IR> (Inappropriate Reason):** Provides a reason that doesn't logically support the proposition.
     - This doesn't fit, as the reason does pertain to the person's actions.
   - **<RR> (Redundant Reason):** Repeats the proposition using different words.
     - Not applicable here.
   - **<WCB> (Weak Causal Basis):** Offers a reason not compelling enough to support the proposition.
     - Not quite, as the focus is on the enumeration of options.
   - **<FU> (False Universals):** Asserts universally agreed points without proof.
     - Doesn’t fit this context.
   - **<DEP> (Double-Edged Phrases):** Uses statements open to dual interpretations.
     - Not applicable here.

3. **Match with Correct Type:**
   - The argument implies that not being in class directly translates to not being a good person. This is an example of <FE> (False Enumeration), as it unfairly limits the measure of "being a good person" to a single event of class attendance.

Therefore, the defective argument type for the string "I thought you were a good person, but you weren’t in class today." is identified as **<FE> (False Enumeration)**.
