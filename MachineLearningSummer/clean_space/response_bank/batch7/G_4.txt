For 
To apply **IDAA** (Application of Decomposition to IDA) to the string "Three kids in one class failed the Jane Eyre quiz, I guess all the other classes will all fail it, too," we will follow the decomposed steps outlined previously.

### Step-by-Step Application:

1. **Extracting the Argument**:
   - Parse the string to understand its structure and the argument it makes:
     - The string provides an observation: "Three kids in one class failed the Jane Eyre quiz."
     - The conclusion drawn from this observation is: "I guess all the other classes will all fail it, too."
   - The proposition here is that the performance of all classes can be inferred from the performance of just one class.

2. **Classifying the Argument**:
   - **Generalization (<G>)**: Check if the argument claims a general truth based on a limited instance:
     - The observation is limited to three kids in one class.
     - The conclusion generalizes the limited instance to all classes.

3. **Verifying Classification**:
   - Compare the initial classification with typical examples of <G>:
     - Typical examples of **Generalization** include: "All sports car drivers are too aggressive!" and "Even though it's only the first day, I can tell this is going to be a boring course."
     - These examples show a pattern of deriving a broad conclusion based on specific instances, similar to the argument in question.

4. **Providing Explanation**:
   - The statement "Three kids in one class failed the Jane Eyre quiz, I guess all the other classes will all fail it, too" fits the classification of **Generalization** because it takes a limited instance (three kids in one class) and extrapolates it to a broader scope (all the other classes), which is logically unsound as it does not account for the variability and conditions of other classes.

### Conclusion:

The string "Three kids in one class failed the Jane Eyre quiz, I guess all the other classes will all fail it, too" is classified under the defective argument type **Generalization (<G>)**.

So, the identification type of the defective argument in the given string <s> is:

```
< G >
```
