### Step-by-Step Breakdown of IDA using IDAA on Given String:

**String (<s>):** "The reason Donald Trump got elected was because liberals took political correctness too far."

#### Step 1: Identify the Core Proposition
- **Core Proposition:** "The reason Donald Trump got elected was because liberals took political correctness too far."

#### Step 2: Analyze the Supporting Reason(s)
- **Reason:** "Liberals took political correctness too far."
  
#### Step 3: Compare with Known Defective Argument Types
1. **Generalization (<G>):** The argument does not claim a general truth based on a specific instance. It instead offers a causal relationship.
2. **False Enumeration (<FE>):** This argument is not providing a limited set of choices or enumerating options.
3. **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>):** The argument does connect the reason directly to the election outcome, but we need to determine if this reason is logically sound.
4. **Redundant Reason (<RR>):** The argument's reason is not restating the proposition in different words.
5. **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>):** The reason seems to correlate political correctness and election outcome without a compelling or detailed explanation. There's an implicit assumption without thorough causational evidence.
6. **False Universals (<FU>):** This argument is not asserting a universal truth based on popularity or without proof.
7. **Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>):** There is no dual interpretation open to significantly contradict the speaker.

#### Step 4: Match and Classify
- **Classification:** The statement implies a causal relationship ("liberals took political correctness too far" leading directly to "Donald Trump got elected") without providing a substantial, detailed explanation. Given that it makes a strong claim without enough compelling evidence, this argument type is best classified as **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>)**.

### Conclusion
By following the decomposition steps, we can determine that the string "The reason Donald Trump got elected was because liberals took political correctness too far." is an example of **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>)**.
