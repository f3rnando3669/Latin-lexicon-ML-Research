For 
To apply the IDAA process to the given argument "We need to fix our broken judicial system by electing new people," let's break down the steps and identify the logical fallacy:

### Steps for Decomposition (D) of IDA

1. **Analyze the Structure of the Argument**: 
   - Main proposition: We need to fix our broken judicial system.
   - Supporting statement: By electing new people.

2. **Identify the Key Elements**:
   - Core claim: To fix our judicial system.
   - Supposed solution or reason: Electing new people.

3. **Compare Against Defined Types**:
   - **Generalization (<G>)**: It is not basing a general truth on a specific instance.
   - **False Enumeration (<FE>)**: It does not present a false dichotomy or limited options; hence does not enumerate fewer or more options than exist.
   - **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>)**: The reason given (electing new people) does not logically follow from the need to fix the judicial system. The connection between the problem (broken judicial system) and solution (electing new people) does not have clear logical support. More detailed reasoning connecting these elements is absent.
   - **Redundant Reason (<RR>)**: There is no repetition of the same idea in different words.
   - **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The given reason might be viewed as not definitive enough to establish that electing new people will indeed fix the judicial system. But this is weaker compared to <IR>.
   - **False Universals (<FU>)**: It does not claim a universal truth; it is specific to the judicial system and does not imply everyone does this.
   - **Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>)**: There is no dual interpretation or ambiguity in the statement presented.

4. **Determine the Type**:
   - The argument most closely fits **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>)**. The reasoning provided (electing new people) does not logically and substantively support fixing the broken judicial system without further evidence or elaboration.

5. **Provide Justification**:
   - The connection between "fixing the judicial system" and "electing new people" is not logically clear within the argument. There is no logical or direct explanation provided that substantiates how electing new people will necessarily lead to fixing the judicial system. Thus, it uses an inappropriate reason to support its main proposition.

Hence, the given string "We need to fix our broken judicial system by electing new people. This logical fallacy is called..." is an example of **<IR> (Inappropriate Reason)**.
