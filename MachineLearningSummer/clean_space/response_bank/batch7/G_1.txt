For 
To apply the process of identifying the type of defective argument in the string provided, we will follow the decomposed steps defined in the previous section. The task is to apply <IDAA> to the string: 

"I heard that the Catholic Church was involved in a sex scandal cover-up. Therefore, my 102-year-old Catholic neighbor, who frequently attends Church, is guilty as well!"

### Step-by-Step Breakdown (<IDAA>)

1. **Analyze Context**
   - The argument is making a claim about the guilt of an individual based on their association with a larger group (the Catholic Church).

2. **Examine Specifics**
   - Specific instance: The Catholic Church was involved in a sex scandal cover-up.
   - General claim: My 102-year-old Catholic neighbor is guilty as well.

3. **Compare with Definitions**
   - Identify if the argument:
     - Claims a general truth based on a specific instance (Generalization, <G>).
     - Lists fewer or more options than actually exist (False Enumeration, <FE>).
     - Provides a reason that doesn't logically support the proposition (Inappropriate Reason, <IR>).
     - Repeats the claim with different wording (Redundant Reason, <RR>).
     - Offers a weak reason for the proposition (Weak Causal Basis, <WCB>).
     - Asserts universally agreed points without proof (False Universals, <FU>).
     - Uses statements open to dual interpretations (Double-Edged Phrases, <DEP>).

4. **Identify Indicators**
   - The argument uses a specific incident involving the Catholic Church to make a sweeping generalization about an individual based on their association with the Church.

5. **Assign Appropriate Label**
   - This argument falls under **Generalization (<G>)** because it is making a broad claim about the neighbor's guilt based on an instance involving a much larger group.

### Conclusion

The identified defective argument type for the string "I heard that the Catholic Church was involved in a sex scandal cover-up. Therefore, my 102-year-old Catholic neighbor, who frequently attends Church, is guilty as well!" is **Generalization (<G>)**.
