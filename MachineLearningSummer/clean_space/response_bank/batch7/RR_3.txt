For 
To apply **<IDAA>** to the given string, let's break down the process step-by-step:

**String <s>:** 
"Speaker 1: Jesus was not really crucified.
Speaker 2: How do I know that’s true?
Speaker 1: Because the Quran says so.
Speaker 2: How do I know the Quran is correct?
Speaker 1: Because the Quran is the Word of God, and everything it says is true.
Speaker 2: How do I know that’s true?
Speaker 1: Because God tells us so, here in the Koran."

### Step 1: Understanding the Input String <s>

- **Speaker 1's Proposition**: Jesus was not really crucified.
- **Speaker 1's Supporting Statements**:
  1. The Quran says Jesus was not crucified.
  2. The Quran is the Word of God.
  3. Everything the Quran says is true because it is the Word of God.
  4. God tells us that the Quran is true.

### Step 2: Identifying Argument Components

- **Main Proposition**: Jesus was not really crucified.
- **Supporting Statements**:
  - The Quran says so.
  - The Quran is the Word of God, and everything it says is true.
  - God tells us in the Quran that everything it says is true.

### Step 3: Matching Argument Components to Defective Argument Types

**Analysis**:
1. **Circular Reasoning (also known as Begging the Question)**: The argument is essentially circular because it relies on the Quran's authority to validate itself. Speaker 1 claims the Quran is true because it is the Word of God, and this assertion comes from the Quran itself.

2. The key problem here is that the argument never provides independent validation outside of the Quran's own claims.

### Defective Argument Type Identification

- **<RR> (Redundant Reason)**: This argument exhibits characteristics of Redundant Reasoning. The reasoning is circular, and each claim supports the other without introducing any new, independent evidence to validate the primary assertion.

Thus, the given string <s> contains the defective argument type **<RR> (Redundant Reason)**.

**Summary**:
- **<IDAA>** has been applied to identify the defective argument type.
- **Steps**:
  1. Read and understand the string <s>.
  2. Identify main proposition and supporting statements.
  3. Match these to the defective argument types definitions.
- **Conclusion**: The argument in the string is identified as **<RR> (Redundant Reason)** due to circular reasoning.
