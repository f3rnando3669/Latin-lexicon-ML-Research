For 
To identify the type of defective argument in the string "Get Verizon--1 billion people can't be wrong" using the decomposed steps \( <IDAA> \), we proceed as follows:

### Application of \<IDAA\>

1. **Input String**:
   - \( <s> = \) "Get Verizon--1 billion people can't be wrong."

2. **Apply Step 1 of \<D\>**:
   - **Read and Parse \( <s> \)**: Understand the argument being made. The string suggests that because 1 billion people have chosen Verizon, it is the correct choice for everyone.

3. **Apply Step 2 of \<D\>**: Determine the argument type.
   - **Check for Generalization \( <G> \)**:
     - This argument does not make a broad claim based on a limited set of specific instances. It rather relies on a large number of people making the same choice.
     
   - **Check for False Enumeration \( <FE> \)**:
     - This argument isn't presenting fewer or more options than actually exist. It is instead suggesting a decision based on popularity.
     
   - **Check for Inappropriate Reason \( <IR> \)**:
     - The reasoning is directly connected to the proposition (popularity as a rationale) but it does not appear inappropriate the way \(<IR>\) arguments usually are.
     
   - **Check for Redundant Reason \( <RR> \)**:
     - This is not simply rephrasing the proposition. It provides a reason (user count) for the proposition but does not form a \( <RR> \).
     
   - **Check for Weak Causal Basis \( <WCB> \)**:
     - The argument is not providing a weak causal relation; rather, it is falling towards reasoning based on quantity rather than direct causality.
     
   - **Check for False Universals \( <FU> \)**:
     - **Yes**, this is using a universally agreed point (large user base) without providing actual proof or reasoning for the quality or suitability of Verizon for an individual user. It asserts popularity as validation.
     
   - **Check for Double-Edged Phrases \( <DEP> \)**:
     - This does not introduce phrases with dual interpretations.

4. **Apply Step 3 of \<D\>**:
   - Based on the detections, this argument matches with **False Universals \(<FU>\)**.
   - Output: **<FU>**

Given the analysis and the steps followed, the identified defective argument type for the string "Get Verizon--1 billion people can't be wrong." is:

**<FU> (False Universals)**
