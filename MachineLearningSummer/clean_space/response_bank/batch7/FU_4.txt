For 
To apply <IDAA> to identify the type of defective argument in the string "“Everyone else is doing it, so should you”," we'll follow the steps outlined in the decomposition of IDA (<D>):

### Step-by-Step IDAA:

#### Step 1: Understand the Argument in <s>
- Argument: "Everyone else is doing it, so should you."

#### Step 2: Identify Key Elements of the Argument
- Proposition: "You should do it."
- Supporting Reason: "Everyone else is doing it."

#### Step 3: Match the Argument to a Defective Argument Type
- **Check Generalization (<G>):** This argument doesn't generalize from a specific instance to a broad claim.
- **Check False Enumeration (<FE>):** This argument doesn't limit or expand the options available.
- **Check Inappropriate Reason (<IR>):** While popularity is offered as a reason, it’s not necessarily illogical but indirect.
- **Check Redundant Reason (<RR>):** The supporting reason isn't a restatement of the proposition.
- **Check Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>):** The provided reason isn’t a weak causal link but rather an appeal to popularity.
- **Check False Universals (<FU>):** Yes, the argument asserts a universally agreed point or appeal to popularity without proper proof.
- **Check Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>):** This argument isn't open to dual interpretations.

#### Step 4: Assign the Defective Argument Type Label
Based on the analysis, the defective argument type label that fits is **False Universals (<FU>)**. The argument "Everyone else is doing it, so should you” reflects an attempt to validate the action based on what everyone else is supposedly doing without offering substantive justifications.

Thus, the identified defective argument type for the string "Everyone else is doing it, so should you” is **<FU>**.
