For 
Let's apply the decomposition of the task of identifying a defective argument type (<IDAA>) to the given statement:

### Step 1: Identification of Argument Type

**Argument Presented:**

- Speaker 1: "We are using thousands of people, who are going door to door to help us spread the word about social injustice and the need for change."
- Speaker 2: "Well then, I can’t be a part of this because I was always been taught that it’s wrong to use people."

**Initial Analysis:**

- **Speaker 1's Argument:** Promoting social injustice awareness through people going door to door.
- **Speaker 2's Argument:** Refusal to participate because they were taught it’s wrong to "use people."

### Step 2: Validation of Identified Type

**Breaking Down Speaker 2's Response:**

- Speaker 2 misinterprets the term “using” people, taking it literally as exploiting people rather than understanding it in the context of mobilizing volunteers for a cause.
- This appears to be an instance where the phrase is open to dual interpretations, potentially against the speaker (Speaker 2).

### Comparison With Definitions:

- **Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>)**:
  - This type involves statements open to dual interpretations, potentially against the speaker.
  - **Example:** "The officer told me to freeze but it was too hot out to be freezing, so I was justified in running away."

**Verification:**

Given the context, the term “using people” is intended to mean “mobilizing volunteers,” but Speaker 2 interprets it as “exploiting people,” leading to a refusal to participate.

### Step 3: Documentation and Explanation

**Identified Type: Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>)**

**Rationale:**

- The phrase "using people" has been interpreted in two ways:
  - _Speaker 1's Intent:_ Mobilizing volunteers for a cause.
  - _Speaker 2's Interpretation:_ Exploiting people, which goes against their ethical beliefs.
- This dual interpretation leads Speaker 2 to refuse participation based on a misunderstanding of the context in which the term is used.

**Conclusion:**

The argument presented by Speaker 2 is a classic example of **Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>)**, where the phrase "using people" is open to dual interpretations, leading to a misinterpretation and rejection of the initial proposal.

Hence, the provided argument fits into the category of **Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>)**.
