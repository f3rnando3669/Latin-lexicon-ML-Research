For 
To apply the task of identifying the type of defective argument in the string "You either support Hillary Clinton for President or you don't believe in women's rights," we’ll follow the detailed steps outlined in the decomposition of \(<IDA>\):

**Step-by-Step Decomposition of \(<IDA>\):**

1. **Understand the Argument Types:** Familiarize yourself with the definitions and examples for each defective argument type (\(<G>\), \(<FE>\), \(<IR>\), \(<RR>\), \(<WCB>\), \(<FU>\), \(<DEP>\)).

2. **Identify Key Elements in \(<s>\):** 
   - “support Hillary Clinton for President” (Option 1)
   - “don't believe in women's rights” (Option 2)

3. **Match Elements to Definitions:**
   - This statement offers two distinct choices.
   - **False Enumeration (\(<FE>\)):** It presents a binary choice, suggesting that supporting Hillary Clinton is the only way to believe in women's rights, excluding other possibilities.

4. **Determine the Closest Match:** 
   - **False Enumeration (\(<FE>\))** is the likely candidate because the statement falsely limits the options to only two, implying that one must either support Hillary Clinton or not believe in women's rights.

5. **Verify Your Conclusion:** 
   - Re-read and confirm that the statement does not acknowledge other possible stances on women's rights or other candidates who may support women's rights. This reinforces the classification as \(<FE>\).

6. **Document the Identified Type:** 
   - Identified Argument Type for \(<s>\): \(<FE>\)
   - Justification: The string imposes an either-or scenario, suggesting that supporting women's rights is exclusively linked to supporting Hillary Clinton, thereby ignoring other potential options and viewpoints.

Therefore, the defective argument type for "You either support Hillary Clinton for President or you don't believe in women's rights" falls under False Enumeration (\(<FE>\)). This follows from the fact that the statement incorrectly narrows the options to just two, without considering other possibilities.
