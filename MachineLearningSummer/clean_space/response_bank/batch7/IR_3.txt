To apply the process of identifying the type of defective argument for the given string, let's follow the defined steps:

### Example String:
"Perhaps the most classic example of this fallacy is the argument for the existence of God. Due to the understanding of nature through science, many of the arguments that used to be used for God (or gods) were abandoned, only to be replaced with new ones, usually involving questions to which science has not definitively answered yet. The move from creationism to intelligent design is a prime example. Currently the origin of life is a popular argument for God (although a classic argument from ignorance), and an area where we very well may have a scientific answer in the next decade, at which time, the 'origin of life' argument will fade away and be replaced by another, thus moving the figurative goalposts farther back as our understanding of the natural world increases. Exception: This fallacy should not be confused with an argument or set of arguments, with multiple propositions inherent in the argument. The reason for the difference between this kind of argument and the moving the goalposts fallacy, is a subtle one, but indicated by a strong initial claim ('has to be', 'must', 'required for', etc.) that gets answered and/or what appears to be ad hoc objections that follow eventually leading to an impossible request for proof. Fun Fact: The name 'moving the goalposts' comes from the analogy of kicking a perfect field goal in American football, only to have the goalposts be moved on you. This would be very unfair. References: This a logical fallacy frequently used on the Internet. No academic sources could be found. Questions about this fallacy? Ask our community!"

### <IDAA> Steps:

**Step 1:** Read and understand the string.
- Statement: The argument discusses a logical fallacy known as "moving the goalposts."

**Step 2:** Identify the main proposition or claim.
- Proposition: The writer claims that arguments for the existence of God are frequently modified and replaced as scientific understanding advances, which fits the notion of "moving the goalposts."

**Step 3:** Analyze the reasoning.
- The core idea is that proponents of the argument for God's existence substitute old arguments for new ones that fit current gaps in scientific knowledge, thus perpetually adjusting the standards or evidence required.

**Step 4:** Match the identified type of defective argument.
- The description given highlights how the argument for God persists by shifting to new, unaddressed questions whenever old ones are answered, aligning with the concept of "moving the goalposts." However, for classification based on the predefined types, we need to determine if it fits the criteria of Generalization, False Enumeration, Inappropriate Reason, Redundant Reason, Weak Causal Basis, False Universals, or Double-Edged Phrases:
  - **Generalization (<G>)**: No, it doesn't claim a general truth based on a specific instance.
  - **False Enumeration (<FE>)**: No, it doesn't restrict or inflate options artificially.
  - **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>)**: No, the reason's flaw isn't necessarily that it doesn't logically support the proposition.
  - **Redundant Reason (<RR>)**: No, it isn't merely restating the main proposition.
  - **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: No, it isn’t solely about weak causation.
  - **False Universals (<FU>)**: Yes, the statement asserts that this strategy of moving goalposts universally applies to arguments for God's existence.
  - **Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>)**: No, it doesn’t involve a statement with dual interpretations.

### Answer:
- The defective argument type for the given string is **<FU> False Universals** because it universally claims that arguments for God's existence perpetually adjust as science advances, without specific proof.
