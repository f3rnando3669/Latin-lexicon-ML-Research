For 
To apply <IDAA> to the given argument, we will follow the specific steps described in the decomposition process:

### Argument (s):
"Every day, I eat cereal for breakfast. One time, I had a muffin instead, and there was a major earthquake in my city. I've eaten cereal ever since."

### Step-by-Step Application:

1. **Step 1: Read the Argument:**
   - The argument reads: "Every day, I eat cereal for breakfast. One time, I had a muffin instead, and there was a major earthquake in my city. I've eaten cereal ever since."

2. **Step 2: Determine the Proposition:**
   - Proposition: Eating cereal is necessary to avoid earthquakes.

3. **Step 3: Analyze Reasoning:**
   - Reasoning: The change from eating cereal to eating a muffin once correlated with a major earthquake, implying that eating cereal prevents earthquakes.

4. **Step 4: Match to Defective Argument Type:**
   - The reasoning suggests a correlation between two events (eating cereal and preventing earthquakes) without providing a logical or causal basis for the connection. This is characteristic of offering a reason that is not compelling enough to support the proposition.

5. **Step 5: Identify and Label:**
   - This argument is identified as having a **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>)**, since the correlation between eating habits and natural disasters is unfounded and lacks a compelling causal connection.

### Conclusion:
The defective argument type for the given argument "Every day, I eat cereal for breakfast. One time, I had a muffin instead, and there was a major earthquake in my city. I've eaten cereal ever since." is identified as **<WCB> (Weak Causal Basis)**.
