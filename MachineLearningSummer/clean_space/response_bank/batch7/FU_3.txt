For 
To apply the task decomposition (IDAA) to the given argument string, "Officer, I was only driving as fast as everyone around me. I'm sure I wasn't speeding.", let's follow the systematic steps:

1. **Analyze the structure of the argument.**
   - The argument consists of a justification for driving at a certain speed based on the behavior of others on the road.

2. **Identify any generalizing statements. (<G>)**
   - The argument doesn't appear to be making a broad generalization from a specific instance.

3. **Check for false choices or omissions. (<FE>)**
   - The argument isn't presenting a limited range of choices or omitting other options.

4. **Look for reasons provided and assess their relevance. (<IR>)**
   - The reason provided ("I was only driving as fast as everyone around me") is used to justify the lack of speeding, but it's not logically relevant because speeding is determined by the speed limit, not the speed of surrounding drivers. This step suggests the argument could be classified under this category.

5. **Examine the argument for redundancy. (<RR>)**
   - The argument doesn't seem to be stating the same thing in different words.

6. **Assess the strength of any causal connections. (<WCB>)**
   - The causality here is weak, but the main issue isn't an inappropriate causal connection; it's more about the irrelevance of the reason given.

7. **Identify any universally asserted points. (<FU>)**
   - There is an implicit assumption that because everyone else is speeding, it must be acceptable, but this is more related to the irrelevance of peer behavior than to a universally asserted point.

8. **Detect any ambiguous or dual interpretation phrases. (<DEP>)**
   - The argument doesn't contain phrases that have dual interpretations working against the speaker.

Given these considerations, the argument "Officer, I was only driving as fast as everyone around me. I'm sure I wasn't speeding." is best classified as <IR> (Inappropriate Reason), because the justification provided (driving speed relative to others) does not logically support the conclusion (not speeding).
