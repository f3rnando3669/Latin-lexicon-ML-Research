### Application of Decomposition to Identification of Defective Argument (<IDAA>)

Let's apply the decomposition steps to the given argument:

#### Example Argument: "You need to go to the party with me, otherwise you’ll just be bored at home."

#### Step 1: Parse the Argument
- Argument: "You need to go to the party with me, otherwise you’ll just be bored at home."

#### Step 2: Identify the Claim
- Main Proposition: "You need to go to the party with me."

#### Step 3: Analyze the Reason
- Reasoning Provided: "Otherwise you’ll just be bored at home."

#### Step 4: Compare with Definitions
- Compare the reasoning and proposition with our defined defective argument types:
  1. **<G> (Generalization Error):** Does not involve a general truth based on a specific instance.
  2. **<IR> (Irrelevant Reason):** The reason "Otherwise you’ll just be bored at home" does not directly support the necessity of going to the party; instead, it assumes that staying home is the only alternative and that it is necessarily negative.
  3. **<FE> (False Exhaustiveness):** Lists only two options—going to the party or being bored at home—while ignoring other potential alternatives (e.g., staying home and doing something fun, going somewhere else).
  4. **<RR> (Redundancy):** Does not restate the proposition in other words.
  5. **<WCB> (Weak Compelling Basis):** The argument could also be seen as offering a weak reason that may not compel someone to go to the party.
  6. **<FU> (Fallacy of Universal Claim):** Does not assert universally agreed points without proof.
  7. **<DEP> (Dual-Edged Proposition):** Does not involve statements open to dual interpretations.

#### Step 5: Determine the Type
- Based on the analysis, the most fitting types are:
  - **<FE> (False Exhaustiveness)** for listing fewer options than actually exist.
  - Additionally, one might argue **<WCB> (Weak Compelling Basis)** if the focus is on the weak nature of the argument that staying home will necessarily lead to boredom.

### Conclusion
- **Primary Type of Defective Argument:** **<FE> (False Exhaustiveness)**
- **Secondary Consideration (if applicable):** **<WCB> (Weak Compelling Basis)**

The defective argument primarily lists fewer options than actually exist, presenting a false dichotomy. Hence, the identified type is **<FE> (False Exhaustiveness)**.
