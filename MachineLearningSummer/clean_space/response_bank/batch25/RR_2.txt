For 
To apply \(IDAA\) to the string "We need to fix our broken judicial system by electing new people." and classify the logical fallacy, we can follow the steps outlined earlier:

### Step 1: Understand and Specify the Task
We need to classify the given string to determine what type of defective argument it represents, according to the categories defined: Generalization \(<G>\), False Enumeration \(<FE>\), Inappropriate Reason \(<IR>\), Redundant Reason \(<RR>\), Weak Causal Basis \(<WCB>\), False Universals \(<FU>\), and Double-Edged Phrases \(<DEP>\).

### Step 2: Define Criteria for Each Type
To classify the string accurately, recall the criteria for each type:
- **Generalization (G):** The string claims a general truth based on a specific instance.
- **False Enumeration (FE):** The string lists fewer or more options than actually exist.
- **Inappropriate Reason (IR):** The string provides a reason that doesn’t logically support the proposition.
- **Redundant Reason (RR):** The string presents a reason that is essentially the same as the proposition.
- **Weak Causal Basis (WCB):** The string offers a weak or insufficient causal basis for a conclusion.
- **False Universals (FU):** The string makes a universal claim without proof.
- **Double-Edged Phrases (DEP):** The string uses statements open to dual interpretation, potentially against the speaker.

### Step 3: Analyze the Structure of the String
Let's assess the structure of the string: "We need to fix our broken judicial system by electing new people."
- The string makes a claim about fixing the judicial system.
- It suggests that the way to fix it is by electing new people.

### Step 4: Match Against Criteria
- **Generalization (G):** Is the argument generalizing from a specific instance? No, it doesn’t seem to generalize from a specific example.
- **False Enumeration (FE):** Does the argument limit options? Yes, it implies that the only way to fix the judicial system is by electing new people, though there could be other ways.
- **Inappropriate Reason (IR):** Does the reason provided logically support the proposition? This doesn’t apply as closely, as the reasoning isn't obviously illogical.
- **Redundant Reason (RR):** Is the reason simply restating the proposition? No, it offers a specific action.
- **Weak Causal Basis (WCB):** Is the causal connection weak? A claim that electing new people alone will fix the judicial system might oversimplify the issue, suggesting a weak causal basis.
- **False Universals (FU):** Does it make a universal claim without proof? This doesn’t apply here.
- **Double-Edged Phrases (DEP):** Are there dual interpretations that could work against the speaker? No clear dual interpretation here.

### Step 5: Classify the String
Based on the analysis:
- There is an element of **False Enumeration \(<FE>\)** because it lists fewer options than actually exist, suggesting that electing new people is the sole solution to fixing the judicial system.
- There is also an element of **Weak Causal Basis \(<WCB>\)** because it assumes that merely electing new people will resolve complex issues within the judicial system, which may not be a strong or sufficient reason.

**Most fitting classification based on matching criteria and logical evaluation:**
- **False Enumeration (FE)**

Therefore, the string "We need to fix our broken judicial system by electing new people." can primarily be classified as False Enumeration \(<FE>\).

This logical fallacy is called False Enumeration (FE).
