For 
Let's apply <IDAA> step-by-step to the provided string:

**Example <s>:** "I see nobody on the road," said Alice.
"I only wish I had such eyes," the king remarked..."To be able to see Nobody! And at that distance, too! Why it's as much as I can do to see real people, by this light."

**Step 1: Understand and Identify the Argument Structure in <s>**
   - Alice's claim: "I see nobody on the road."
   - The king's remark introduces a humorous misunderstanding of this claim, suggesting he envies Alice's ability to see "Nobody" as if "Nobody" were a real person.
   - The king's supporting rationale: Remarking on the difficulty of seeing "Nobody" compared to seeing real people by the dim light.

**Step 2: Categorize the Argument by Type**
   - This passage relies on the dual interpretation of the word "nobody." Alice means she sees no one on the road, while the king humorously interprets it as seeing a person named "Nobody."

**Step 3: Validate the Categorization**
   - The dialogue clearly plays on two interpretations of the word "nobody," which fits the definition of <DEP> (Double-Edged Phrases), where a statement is open to dual interpretations.

**Step 4: Apply the Classification**
   - Classify <s> as <DEP>.

**Step 5: Document the Process**
   - The string "I see nobody on the road," said Alice.
"I only wish I had such eyes," the king remarked..."To be able to see Nobody! And at that distance, too! Why it's as much as I can do to see real people, by this light." was classified as <DEP> according to the steps outlined.

By following these steps, we effectively decomposed and categorized the argument type in the given string. The classification result is:
   - **Classification:** <DEP>
