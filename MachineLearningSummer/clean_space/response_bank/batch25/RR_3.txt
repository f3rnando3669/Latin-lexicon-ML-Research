Sure, let's apply <IDAA>, the decompositional approach, to classify the argument in the provided string.

### Step-by-Step Application of <IDAA> to the String

#### 1. Understand the Argument Type Definitions
We have them already defined:
- **<G>**: Generalization
- **<FE>**: False Enumeration
- **<IR>**: Inappropriate Reason
- **<RR>**: Redundant Reason
- **<WCB>**: Weak Causal Basis
- **<FU>**: False Universals
- **<DEP>**: Double-Edged Phrases

#### 2. Analyze the Given String (<s>)
Let's break down the conversation:
- **Speaker 1**: Jesus was not really crucified.
- **Speaker 2**: How do I know that’s true?
- **Speaker 1**: Because the Quran says so.
- **Speaker 2**: How do I know the Quran is correct?
- **Speaker 1**: Because the Quran is the Word of God, and everything it says is true.
- **Speaker 2**: How do I know that’s true?
- **Speaker 1**: Because God tells us so, here in the Koran.

#### 3. Compare the String Against Each Argument Type
- **<G>**: There doesn’t appear to be a generalization based on a specific instance.
- **<FE>**: No fewer or more options than actually exist are listed.
- **<IR>**: The reasons provided may seem to support the proposition, but they are circular.
- **<RR>**: The statements appear to be repeating the initial claim in a circular logic manner.
- **<WCB>**: There’s a weak causal relationship where the truth of the Quran is assumed based on the assertion that it is the Word of God.
- **<FU>**: Assertions that the Quran is true because it is the Word of God and vice versa assume points without proof.
- **<DEP>**: No dual interpretation is involved in this statement.

#### 4. Classify the String
The provided string primarily fits under **Redundant Reason (<RR>)** because each subsequent reason given by Speaker 1 essentially restates the same claim (that the Quran is true because it says so), creating a circular argument.

#### 5. Document the Classification Process
- **<G>**: No generalization from a specific instance.
- **<FE>**: Not limiting options incorrectly.
- **<IR>**: Circular reasoning not necessarily inappropriate, but...
- **<RR>**: Circular logic; different words saying the same thing repetitively.
- **<WCB>**: Weak causal relationship indirect here.
- **<FU>**: Assuming universally agreed points without proof.
- **<DEP>**: Not dual interpretations.

The string was entirely analyzed, and upon comparison, the argument fits best under **Redundant Reason (<RR>)** as it restates the proposition in different forms without offering new supporting evidence.

This structured decompositional approach leads us to classify the provided argument accurately. The string represents a **Redundant Reason (<RR>)** fallacy due to its circular and repetitive logic.
