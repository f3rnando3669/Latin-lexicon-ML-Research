Certainly! Let's apply the IDAA process step by step to classify the string "The reason Donald Trump got elected was because liberals took political correctness too far."

### Decomposition of IDAA:

1. **Step 1: Understand the Definitions**
    - We need to understand the definitions of <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, and <DEP>.

2. **Step 2: Parse the Statement**
    - The statement is: "The reason Donald Trump got elected was because liberals took political correctness too far."

3. **Step 3: Identify the Nature of the Claim**
    - The claim is about the reason for Donald Trump's election. It attributes his election victory to liberals taking political correctness too far.

4. **Step 4: Match the Argument Types**
    - We need to compare this claim against the definitions of the defective argument types to determine which one fits best.

5. **Step 5: Assess Specific Criteria**
    - **Generalization (<G>)**: This statement doesn't make a general claim based on a specific instance.
    - **False Enumeration (<FE>)**: The statement doesn't provide a list of options.
    - **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>)**: This might be a candidate. We need to determine if the reason given (liberals took political correctness too far) logically supports the proposition (Trump's election).
    - **Redundant Reason (<RR>)**: The reason provided is not restating the proposition in different words.
    - **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: This might be a candidate. We need to evaluate if the causal link between 'liberals taking political correctness too far' and 'Trump getting elected' is strong enough.
    - **False Universals (<FU>)**: The statement is not asserting a universally agreed point without proof.
    - **Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>)**: The statement doesn't provide a dual interpretation that could backfire against the speaker.

6. **Validate the Classification**
    - We need to focus on <IR> and <WCB>:
      - **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>)**: We should validate if the reason provided (liberals took political correctness too far) is irrelevant to the proposition (Trump's election). However, there might be some logical connection, albeit debatable.
      - **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The reason provided could be seen as a weak causal link. The claim that Trump's election was caused solely by liberals taking political correctness too far is not compelling enough. It oversimplifies a complex event by highlighting just one factor out of many.

After closely examining these types, the most fitting classification for the argument is:

**<WCB> (Weak Causal Basis)**

### Conclusion:
The string "The reason Donald Trump got elected was because liberals took political correctness too far." has been classified as <WCB> because it offers a weak causal basis by attributing a complex political event to a single factor without substantial support.
