For 
Sure, let's apply the defined steps of <IDAA> to classify the given string:

### Step 1: Understand the Argument

1. **Identify the Core Proposition**:
   - Speaker 1's core proposition is about spreading the word about social injustice and the need for change.
   - Speaker 2's core proposition is that they can't be part of the initiative because using people is wrong.

### Step 2: Determine the Argument's Form

2. **Identify the Argument Type**:
   - Analyze Speaker 2's argument response. It doesn't address the main proposition about social injustice directly but instead focuses on the wording "using people."

### Step 3: Compare the Argument Against Definitions

3. **Match Against Definitions**:
   - Compare Speaker 2's argument to the predefined defective argument types.
   - Speaker 2 seems to be misinterpreting "using people" (which likely means employing volunteers) as exploitation, leading to an unreasonable conclusion.

### Step 4: Verify Logical Consistency

4. **Check the Logical Consistency**:
   - The reasoning does not logically support the proposition. By interpreting "using people" literally, the speaker provides an inappropriate reason to reject the main message about social injustice.

### Step 5: Identify Potential Ambiguities

5. **Identify Ambiguous Statements (for <DEP>)**:
   - The term "using people" is a double-edged phrase that can be interpreted as either employing people to help a cause (positive connotation) or exploiting people (negative connotation).

### Step 6: Assign the Defective Argument Type

6. **Assign the Defective Argument Type**:
   - Based on the ambiguous nature of the term and the inappropriate reasoning provided, this statement fits <DEP> (Double-Edged Phrases).

### Step 7: Validation Check

7. **Cross-check and Validation**:
   - Cross-checking with the definition and additional examples, this classification seems consistent and accurate.

### Conclusion

By following the structured steps, we can classify the argument in the given string as <DEP> (Double-Edged Phrases). This classification fits because the speaker's reasoning relies on an ambiguous interpretation of the phrase "using people," which does not logically support the proposition against social injustice initiatives.
