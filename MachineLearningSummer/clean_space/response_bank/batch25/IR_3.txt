For 
To classify the provided text using the structured approach of <IDAA>, we will follow the outlined steps:

### Decomposition Steps (<D>):

1. **Understand the Task Specification:**
   - We are classifying the text as one of <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>.

2. **Define Decision Criteria:**
   - **<G> (Generalization):** Based on specific instances claiming a general truth.
   - **<FE> (False Enumeration):** Presenting fewer or more options than exist.
   - **<IR> (Inappropriate Reason):** Providing illogical support.
   - **<RR> (Redundant Reason):** Providing a redundant restatement as a new reason.
   - **<WCB> (Weak Causal Basis):** Weak or non-compelling causal basis.
   - **<FU> (False Universals):** Asserting without proof universally agreed points.
   - **<DEP> (Double-Edged Phrases):** Statements open to dual interpretations.

3. **Preprocessing:**
   - No significant preprocessing is required for the given text as it is already clear and well-structured.

4. **Analyze the Input:**
   - The text discusses the fallacy of "moving the goalposts" and provides an example involving arguments for the existence of God. It talks about how arguments evolve and change when challenged by scientific progress.

5. **Match Against Decision Criteria:**

   - **Generalization:** The text does not claim a general truth based on specific instances. It instead explains an evolving argument.
   
   - **False Enumeration:** The text does not list any options incorrectly.
   
   - **Inappropriate Reason:** The text does not provide a reason that fails to logically support its main point.
   
   - **Redundant Reason:** The text does not repeat the same reason using different words.
   
   - **Weak Causal Basis:** The text does not offer a weak causal basis for an argument; instead, it describes a logical fallacy.
   
   - **False Universals:** The text does not assert universally agreed points without proof.
   
   - **Double-Edged Phrases:** The text does not use statements open to dual interpretations in a way that could undermine the speaker's position.

6. **Classify and Conclude:**
   - The text does not seem to fit any of the defined defective argument types directly. It is more of an explanation of a logical fallacy rather than an argument committing one of the fallacies we have criteria for. 

### Summary of Steps for <IDAA>:

1. **Understand the categories**: Done.
2. **Define criteria for classification**: Done.
3. (Optional) **Preprocess the string**: Not needed.
4. **Analyze the string**: The string describes the fallacy of "moving the goalposts."
5. **Compare to criteria**: The string does not fit any single defined defective argument type.
6. **Classify the string**: The string is not an example of any defective argument types provided.

### Conclusion:
The string provided is an explanatory text about the "moving the goalposts" fallacy. It does not commit any of the fallacies as defined by <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>. As such, under the current classification schema, it would be classified as **none of the above**.

If the task was specifically to find examples of <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP> within the text, we could proceed to search within for specific sentences matching those criteria. However, the main body of text as provided does not fit any of those fallacies directly.
