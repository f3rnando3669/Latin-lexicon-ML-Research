For 
To apply <IDAA> to the string "Encourages the audience to become part of a group or act because other people are acting in the same way," we will go through the decomposed steps methodically as outlined previously.

### Step 1: Understand the Definitions
- Reviewed and understood definitions (provided above):
  - **<G>: Generalization**
  - **<FE>: False Enumeration**
  - **<IR>: Inappropriate Reason**
  - **<RR>: Redundant Reason**
  - **<WCB>: Weak Causal Basis**
  - **<FU>: False Universals**
  - **<DEP>: Double-Edged Phrases**

### Step 2: Identify Key Characteristics
- Extract the key characteristics of each type:
  - **<G>: Making a broad claim based on a specific instance.
  - **<FE>: Listing limited or excessive options.
  - **<IR>: Providing an irrelevant reason.
  - **<RR>: Presenting a redundant reason.
  - **<WCB>: Weakly supported causal relationship.
  - **<FU>: Making universally agreed claims without proof.
  - **<DEP>: Using statements that have dual interpretations.

### Step 3: Analyze the Given String
- String <s>: "Encourages the audience to become part of a group or act because other people are acting in the same way."
  - Components: Encouragement to join a group or act, justification based on others' actions.

### Step 4: Match the Characteristics
- The string suggests action based on the behavior of others, which indicates an appeal to popularity.
- This aligns with **<FU>: False Universals**, as it relies on asserting the validity of an action based on the fact that others are doing it.

### Step 5: Select the Closest Match
- The string aligns closely with **<FU>**: False Universals, as it leverages the idea that one should act because others are acting in the same way without providing substantive reasons.

### Step 6: Validate the Classification
- Re-examining the string confirms that the encouragement is based solely on the actions of others, fitting the classification of **<FU>**.

### Step 7: Document the Classification
- Classification: **<FU>: False Universals**
- Reason: The string encourages action based on the appeal to popularity, asserting that one should join a group or act a certain way because others are doing so, typical of false universals.

By following these steps, we have systematically classified the sample string as an example of **<FU>: False Universals**:

**Classification: <FU>**
**Reason:** The string employs a universal appeal, encouraging the audience to act similarly to others, qualifying it as a false universal argument without substantive justification.
