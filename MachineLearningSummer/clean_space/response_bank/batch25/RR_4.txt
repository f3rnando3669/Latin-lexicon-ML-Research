For 
Let's apply the defined decomposition steps (IDAA) to classify the string "That restaurant is popular because everyone in town goes there."

**Example String:** "That restaurant is popular because everyone in town goes there."

### Step 1: Parse the Sentence
- Subject: That restaurant
- Predicate: is popular
- Reason: because everyone in town goes there

### Step 2: Identify Argument Style
- The sentence provides a reason for the restaurant's popularity, claiming it is due to the fact that everyone in town goes there.

### Step 3: Check for Specific Indicators
- The reason given is based on the behavior of the majority ("everyone in town goes there").

### Step 4: Match to Definitions
- The fallacy of asserting universally agreed points or basing a point on popularity falls under the definition of <FU> (False Universals). The sentence assumes the restaurant's popularity can be validated solely because many people go there, which is an appeal to popularity.

### Step 5: Classify
- The string "That restaurant is popular because everyone in town goes there." is classified as <FU>.

This process systematically identifies the fallacy and matches it to the correct definition, ensuring accurate classification.
