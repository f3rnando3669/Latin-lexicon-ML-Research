Sure, let's apply the IDAA methodology step-by-step to the statement: "I drank bottled water and now I am sick, so the water must have made me sick."

1. **Understand the Definitions:**  
   - <G>: Generalizing from specific instances.
   - <FE>: Listing fewer or more options than exist.
   - <IR>: Providing an irrelevant reason.
   - <RR>: Reasons that restate the proposition.
   - <WCB>: Weak causal link.
   - <FU>: Asserting universals without proof.
   - <DEP>: Ambiguous or dual interpretations.

2. **Analyze the String <s>:**  
   "I drank bottled water and now I am sick, so the water must have made me sick."

3. **Identify Key Features:**  
   - The argument suggests a direct causal relationship between drinking bottled water and getting sick.

4. **Match Features to Definitions:**  
   - This argument assumes a causal link between drinking bottled water and becoming sick without considering other possible causes for the sickness. 

5. **Assign the Classification:**  
   - This fits the definition of <WCB>: Weak Causal Basis. The argument offers a causal basis that is not compelling enough to establish a direct cause-and-effect relationship.

6. **Verify the Classification:**  
   - Reevaluating, the statement does indeed suggest a weak causal link without sufficient evidence, confirming that it is best classified under <WCB>.

Thus, the string "I drank bottled water and now I am sick, so the water must have made me sick." is of type <WCB> (Weak Causal Basis).
