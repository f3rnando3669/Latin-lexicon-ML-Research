For 
To apply <IDAA> to the string "Farmer McDonald: Ever since they put up that new power plant across the river, we haven't had a bit of rain. I'm tellin' you, mankind has got too big for its britches when it fiddles around with nature.", we will decompose the task step-by-step:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (D) of IDA:

1. **Identify the Context and Proposition**:
   - Context: Farmer McDonald is commenting on lack of rain and attributing it to the new power plant.
   - Proposition: The new power plant caused the lack of rain.

2. **Analyze the Structure of the Argument**:
   - The argument structure: There is a correlation drawn between the new power plant's existence and the lack of rain. It then leads to a general statement about mankind interfering with nature.

3. **Compare Argument Types Definitions**:
   - <G> (Generalization): Claims a general truth based on a specific instance.
   - <FE> (False Enumeration): Lists fewer or more options than actually exist.
   - <IR> (Inappropriate Reason): Provides a reason that doesn't logically support the proposition.
   - <RR> (Redundant Reason): Appears as a new reason but says the same thing using different words.
   - <WCB> (Weak Causal Basis): Offers a causal basis that isnâ€™t compelling enough.
   - <FU> (False Universals): Asserts universally agreed points without proof.
   - <DEP> (Double-Edged Phrases): Uses statements open to dual interpretations.

4. **Match Characteristics to Definitions**:
   - The statement seems to fit <WCB> (Weak Causal Basis) because Farmer McDonald attributes the absence of rain to the new power plant without providing compelling scientific evidence to support this causal link. The reasoning is based on correlation without substantiating causation.
   - Additionally, the suggestion that "mankind has got too big for its britches when it fiddles around with nature" may also hint at a <G> (Generalization) since it generalizes the idea that any interference by mankind in nature is detrimental.

5. **Classify the Argument**:
   - Primary classification: <WCB> (Weak Causal Basis) due to the weak causal link offered between the power plant and the lack of rain.
   - Secondary classification: Potentially <G> (Generalization), considering the broader generalization about mankind's interference with nature.

6. **Justify the Classification**:
   - The primary classification as <WCB> is justified because the argument relies on a correlation (power plant and lack of rain) without presenting compelling evidence for causation. It is a weak causal basis since the lack of rain can result from various other factors.
   - The secondary classification as <G> can be considered since Farmer McDonald extrapolates a general truth (mankind's interference with nature is always negative) based on the specific instance of the power plant.

By following these steps, we accurately classify the argument type in the given string using a clear and systematic process.
