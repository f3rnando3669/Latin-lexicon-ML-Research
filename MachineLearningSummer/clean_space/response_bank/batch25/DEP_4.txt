For 
Let's apply the previously defined step-by-step decomposition for <IDAA> to the statement: "It is immoral to kill an innocent human being. Fetuses are innocent human beings. Therefore, it is immoral to kill fetuses."

### Step-by-Step Decomposition for <IDAA>

1. **Input Identification**:
   - Input string <s>: "It is immoral to kill an innocent human being. Fetuses are innocent human beings. Therefore, it is immoral to kill fetuses."

2. **Argument Recognition**:
   - The string presents a structured argument attempting to derive a conclusion from premises.
     - Premise 1: "It is immoral to kill an innocent human being."
     - Premise 2: "Fetuses are innocent human beings."
     - Conclusion: "Therefore, it is immoral to kill fetuses."

3. **Classification Criteria Mapping**:
   - **<G> Generalization**: Not applicable as it isn’t making a generalized statement based on a specific instance.
   - **<FE> False Enumeration**: Not applicable as it doesn’t list options.
   - **<IR> Inappropriate Reason**: Examine if the premises logically support the conclusion.
   - **<RR> Redundant Reason**: Check if the conclusion is simply a restatement of the premises in other words.
   - **<WCB> Weak Causal Basis**: Not applicable as it doesn’t involve a cause-and-effect scenario.
   - **<FU> False Universals**: Not applicable as it doesn’t assert universally agreed points without proof.
   - **<DEP> Double-Edged Phrases**: Not applicable as it doesn’t provide dual interpretations.

4. **Keyword Matching and Context Analysis**:
   - Analyze keywords:
     - "It is immoral to kill an innocent human being." is a moral assertion.
     - "Fetuses are innocent human beings." is a categorical statement.
     - "Therefore, it is immoral to kill fetuses." implies a logical conclusion from the premises.

5. **Type Assertion**:
   - Evaluate if the argument uses premises that logically connect to the conclusion. The argument asserts that killing innocent human beings is immoral and categorizes fetuses as innocent human beings to derive the conclusion.
   - It doesn’t provide an irrelevant reason, but it needs to be checked if it restates the initial proposition.

6. **Review and Validation**:
   - The conclusion "it is immoral to kill fetuses" appears to be a rephrasing of the premises "It is immoral to kill an innocent human being" and "Fetuses are innocent human beings."
   - The key issue might be redundancy in presenting the same moral judgment framed in slightly different terms.

Conclusively, the argument has a redundancy aspect where the conclusion doesn’t introduce new information but rehashes the premises. 

Thus, the string <s> "It is immoral to kill an innocent human being. Fetuses are innocent human beings. Therefore, it is immoral to kill fetuses." can be classified as of type <RR> (Redundant Reason).
