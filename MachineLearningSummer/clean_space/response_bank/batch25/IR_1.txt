For 
Let's apply the step-by-step approach \(IDAA\) to classify the string "My best friend says you’re a liar, so I’m not going to talk to you."

### Step 1: Understand the Types of Defective Arguments
First, let's recall the definitions:
- **Generalization (G)**
- **False Enumeration (FE)**
- **Inappropriate Reason (IR)**
- **Redundant Reason (RR)**
- **Weak Causal Basis (WCB)**
- **False Universals (FU)**
- **Double-Edged Phrases (DEP)**

### Step 2: Preliminary Identification
Read the string carefully:
"My best friend says you’re a liar, so I’m not going to talk to you."

### Step 3: Check for Generalization (G)
- The string does not make a broad claim based on a limited instance. It doesn’t use words like "always", "all", "every", "never".

### Step 4: Check for False Enumeration (FE)
- The string does not list fewer or more options than actually exist. There’s no dichotomy or limited choice presented.

### Step 5: Check for Inappropriate Reason (IR)
- This step looks promising. The reason "My best friend says you’re a liar" doesn’t logically support the proposition "I’m not going to talk to you." It's based on hearsay and an ad hominem attack rather than a logical argument.

### Step 6: Check for Redundant Reason (RR)
- The string does not repeat the proposition in different words.

### Step 7: Check for Weak Causal Basis (WCB)
- The string does not claim a causal relationship based on minimal or anecdotal evidence.

### Step 8: Check for False Universals (FU)
- The string does not assert any universally agreed points without proof.

### Step 9: Check for Double-Edged Phrases (DEP)
- The string is not open to dual interpretations that could work against the speaker.

### Step 10: Classification
Based on the analysis:
- **\(s\) is best classified as \(⟨IR⟩\) since the given reason ("My best friend says you’re a liar") does not logically support the resulting action ("I’m not going to talk to you").**

### Step 11: Verification and Final Decision
Reviewing the classification, it appears accurate. The argument provided is clearly an \(⟨IR⟩\)—an Inappropriate Reason.

### Conclusion
The string "My best friend says you’re a liar, so I’m not going to talk to you." has been classified as an \(⟨IR⟩\) under the IDAA decomposition.
