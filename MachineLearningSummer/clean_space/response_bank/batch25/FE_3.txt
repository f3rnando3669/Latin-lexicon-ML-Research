Sure, let's apply the steps of IDAA to classify the statement "People either like coffee or hate it."

### Decomposition of IDA into Specific Steps (IDAA)

1. **Extract the Proposition:**
   - Proposition: "People either like coffee or hate it."

2. **Identify Distinguishing Features:**
   - Keywords: "either", "or", "like coffee", "hate it"

3. **Compare with Definitions:**
   - <G> Generalization: Asserting a general truth based on a specific instance.
     - The statement does generalize about people's preferences, but the main issue is it presents only two options.
   - <FE> False Enumeration: Listing fewer or more options than actually exist.
     - The statement offers only two distinct choices, implying that there are no other possible stances on coffee.
   - <IR> Inappropriate Reason: Providing a reason that doesn't logically support the proposition.
     - The statement does not provide a supporting reason, so this doesn't apply.
   - <RR> Redundant Reason: Saying the same thing using different words.
     - The statement does not repeat the proposition in a different form.
   - <WCB> Weak Causal Basis: Offering a weak causal relationship.
     - The statement does not establish a causal relationship.
   - <FU> False Universals: Asserting universally agreed points without proof.
     - The statement does generalize but doesn't directly assert universal agreement.
   - <DEP> Double-Edged Phrases: Using phrases open to dual interpretations.
     - The statement is straightforward and doesn't have dual interpretations.

4. **Apply Logical Analysis:**
   - Evaluate if the statement presents a false dilemma by eliminating other possible preferences or neutral stances towards coffee.

5. **Conclude with Classification:**
   - The statement clearly presents only two options ("like coffee" or "hate it"), neglecting the possibility that people might be indifferent, have mixed feelings, or accept coffee under certain circumstances but not others. This limitation fits the definition of False Enumeration.

### Conclusion
The classification of the statement "People either like coffee or hate it." is <FE> (False Enumeration).
