For 
Certainly! Let's apply the <IDAA> method to the given string "You either support Hillary Clinton for President or you don't believe in women's rights."

### Step 1: Understand the Criteria for Each Defective Argument Type

- **<G>: Generalization** - Claiming a general truth based on a specific instance.
- **<FE>: False Enumeration** - Listing fewer or more options than actually exist.
- **<IR>: Inappropriate Reason** - Providing a reason that doesn't logically support the proposition.
- **<RR>: Redundant Reason** - When it appears to be presented as a new reason but says the same thing using different words.
- **<WCB>: Weak Causal Basis** - Offering a causal basis that is not compelling enough to support the proposition.
- **<FU>: False Universals** - Asserting universally agreed points without proof.
- **<DEP>: Double-Edged Phrases** - Using statements open to dual interpretations, potentially against the speaker.

### Step 2: Extract and Parse the String
- Proposition: "You either support Hillary Clinton for President or you don't believe in women's rights."

### Step 3: Identify Key Components in the Argument
- Explicit options presented: Support Hillary Clinton for President / Don't believe in women's rights.
- Implication that not supporting Hillary Clinton equates to not believing in women's rights.

### Step 4: Match Components to Defective Argument Types
- **False Enumeration (<FE>)**: The proposition simplifies the options to just two, excluding other possibilities such as supporting other candidates while still believing in women's rights.
- Consider if any other defective argument types fit this statement:
  - **<G>**: It doesn't generalize a truth based on a single instance.
  - **<IR>**: The reasoning isn't illogical per se; it's more about limiting choices.
  - **<RR>**: The proposition and the reason are not redundantly rephrased versions.
  - **<WCB>**: The causal link is not the focus here.
  - **<FU>**: It doesn't universally assert a point without proof.
  - **<DEP>**: No dual interpretations leading to opposing outcomes.

### Step 5: Make the Classification
- The argument provides only two options when more exist, making it fit the criteria for **False Enumeration (<FE>)**.

### Step 6: Validate Classification
- Review each step to ensure that the string fits <FE> effectively:
  - It limits options unfairly, fitting the False Enumeration type.
  - None of the other defective argument types apply as neatly to this scenario.

Therefore, the classification for the string "You either support Hillary Clinton for President or you don't believe in women's rights" is **<FE>** (False Enumeration).
