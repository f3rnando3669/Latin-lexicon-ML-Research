For 
To apply our structured approach <IDAA> to the string "Everyone else is doing it, so should you", let's break down the classification process step-by-step.

### Example String <s>:
"Everyone else is doing it, so should you."

### Step-by-Step Classification:

1. **Identify the Statement's Structure and Purpose:**
   - **Structure:** The string asserts that because a majority (or everyone) is doing something, the listener should also do the same.
   - **Purpose:** The purpose is to compel the listener to follow the majority based on the appeal to common action.

2. **Match Against Known Patterns:**
   - The phrase "Everyone else is doing it" is a clear indicator of trying to make a behavior seem right because it is popular.

3. **Evaluate Specific Criteria for Each Argument Type:**
   - **Generalization (<G>):** Does <s> generalize a specific instance?
     - No, it doesn't generalize from a specific instance to a broad category.
   - **False Enumeration (<FE>):** Does <s> list fewer or more options than exist?
     - No, it doesn't involve listing options but is compelling action based on popularity.
   - **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>):** Does <s> provide a reason that doesnâ€™t logically support the proposition?
     - It indirectly does so, but more specific patterns can be identified.
   - **Redundant Reason (<RR>):** Does <s> rephrase the original proposition as a new reason?
     - No, it isn't simply rephrasing the main proposition.
   - **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>):** Does <s> offer a weak causal basis?
     - No, it doesn't imply a causal relationship but rather appeals to action based on majority behavior.
   - **False Universals (<FU>):** Does <s> assert universally agreed points without proof?
     - Yes, it asserts that because "everyone else" is doing something, it must be correct, without providing real proof.
   - **Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>):** Does <s> use statements open to dual interpretations?
     - No, the statement is quite clear in its intent without dual meanings.

4. **Verify Accuracy by Rechecking:**
   - Rechecking the criteria, the argument most closely fits the False Universals pattern by appealing to popularity for validation.

5. **Classify the Argument Type:**
   - Based on the thorough evaluation, <s> "Everyone else is doing it, so should you" will be classified as <FU> (False Universals).

### Conclusion
By following these steps, the string "Everyone else is doing it, so should you" is classified as <FU> (False Universals). This methodical analysis ensures that the classification process is accurate and consistent.
