### Application of \( <IDAA> \) to the Given String:

Let's follow the step-by-step decomposition to classify the string "I heard that the Catholic Church was involved in a sex scandal cover-up. Therefore, my 102-year-old Catholic neighbor, who frequently attends Church, is guilty as well!" into the appropriate defective argument type.

#### Step 1: Identify the Proposition:
- Proposition: "My 102-year-old Catholic neighbor, who frequently attends Church, is guilty as well."

#### Step 2: Recognize Potential Defective Argument Types:
- We need to consider if this proposition exhibits characteristics of Generalization (<G>), False Enumeration (<FE>), Inappropriate Reason (<IR>), Redundant Reason (<RR>), Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>), False Universals (<FU>), or Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>).

#### Step 3: Match Definitions to Clues in the Proposition:
- **Generalization (<G>)**: This seems like it might apply here, as the argument is making a broad claim about a specific individual based on a wider, unrelated instance.
- **False Enumeration (<FE>)**: This does not seem to involve limiting options.
- **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>)**: This could potentially apply if the reason given does not logically support the conclusion.
- **Redundant Reason (<RR>)**: No noticeable redundant reasoning here.
- **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The proposition might have a weak causal link, but that doesn't seem to be the main issue.
- **False Universals (<FU>)**: This doesn’t seem to apply, as it does not assert a universally agreed point.
- **Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>)**: There’s no dual interpretation involved.

#### Step 4: Narrow Down and Confirm Defective Type:
- The argument draws an unwarranted generalization from the actions of the Catholic Church as an institution to an individual member of that church.
- This aligns closely with a **Generalization (<G>)**, because it is making a broad and unsupported leap from a general instance to a specific case.

#### Step 5: Classify the String:
- **<s>**: "I heard that the Catholic Church was involved in a sex scandal cover-up. Therefore, my 102-year-old Catholic neighbor, who frequently attends Church, is guilty as well!"
- **Defective Argument Type**: **<G>** (Generalization).

### Summary:
By applying the decomposed steps of \( <D> \) to classify the string \( <s> \), we determined that the argument represents a **Generalization (<G>)**. The argument erroneously applies a specific instance (the Catholic Church's involvement in a scandal) to a particular individual (the neighbor), without justifiable reasoning.
