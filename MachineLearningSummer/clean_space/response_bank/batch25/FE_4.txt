For 
Let's apply the step-by-step decomposition process (\<D\>) to classify the given string "I thought you were a good person, but you weren’t in class today." as one of the defective argument types (\<G>, \<FE>, \<IR>, \<RR>, \<WCB>, \<FU>, or \<DEP>). 

### Decomposition (\<D\>) of the Task (\<IDA\>):

1. **Identify the Argument:**
   - Parse the given string \(<s>\) to understand the complete argument presented.

2. **Extract Key Elements:**
   - Identify key phrases or structures in the argument that fit one of the known fallacy patterns.

3. **Match Against Definitions:**
   - Compare the identified key elements and overall structure of the argument against the definitions of the defective argument types.

4. **Classify the Argument:**
   - Based on the matching criteria, assign the corresponding defective argument type to the string \(<s>\).

5. **Verify the Classification:**
   - Double-check the classification to ensure it aligns correctly with the definitions provided for each fallacy type.

### Step-by-Step Application of \(\<IDAA>\):

1. **Identify the Argument:**
   - The given string is: "I thought you were a good person, but you weren’t in class today."

2. **Extract Key Elements:**
   - Key phrases: 
     - Premise: "I thought you were a good person"
     - Contrasting conjunction: "but"
     - Reason: "you weren’t in class today"

3. **Match Against Definitions:**
   - Inappropriate Reason (\(<IR>\)): Providing a reason that doesn't logically support the proposition.
   - The argument links being a good person to attendance in class, which is not a logical or direct connection. Being absent from class does not inherently reflect on one's overall character as a good person.

4. **Classify the Argument:**
   - The argument "I thought you were a good person, but you weren’t in class today." is most closely classified as an Inappropriate Reason (\(<IR>\)).

5. **Verify the Classification:**
   - Review if it fits \(<IR>\): The statement indeed presents an inappropriate reason (absence from class) to make a judgment about the person's character, which is not a valid or relevant connection.

So, the given string \(<s>\) "I thought you were a good person, but you weren’t in class today." is classified as \<IR>.
