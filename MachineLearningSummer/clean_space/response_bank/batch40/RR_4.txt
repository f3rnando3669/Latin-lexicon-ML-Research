For 
To apply <IDAA> (the application of D, which is the decomposition of t, to IDA) to the statement "That restaurant is popular because everyone in town goes there," let's break the process down into specific steps:

1. **Step 1: Identify the Proposition (P) and Reason (R) in the statement**
2. **Step 2: Determine which part of the argument (P, R, PR) is defective**
3. **Step 3: Classify the defect using the given types (G, FE, IR, RR, WCB, FU, DEP)**

**Step 1: Identify the Proposition (P) and Reason (R)**
- Proposition (P): "That restaurant is popular"
- Reason (R): "because everyone in town goes there"

**Step 2: Determine which part of the argument is defective**
- We need to analyze the reason (R) to see if it conclusively demonstrates the proposition (P) or if it is a valid reasoning or not.

**Step 3: Classify the defect using the given types**
- Let's break down each defect type to see if it fits the reasoning:
  - **Generalization (G)**: This defect pertains to a hasty generalization. It doesn't quite fit our statement because the statement does not make a broad claim about all situations.
  - **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: This defect happens when possibilities are not fully considered, often posing a false dichotomy. It also doesn't fit our statement.
  - **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: This defect occurs when the reason given does not conclusively prove the proposition.
  - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: This defect occurs when the reason is merely a repetition of the original proposition in slightly different words.
  - **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: This defect arises when the causal connection provided is weak or not compelling.
  - **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**: Here, an argument assumes something must be true because many people believe it to be true. It fits our analysis as the statement assumes the restaurant's popularity based solely on local patronage.
  - **Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)**: This defect occurs when the statement can be interpreted in more than one way. It doesnâ€™t fit our scenario as the language is clear.

Given these considerations, the statement "That restaurant is popular because everyone in town goes there" most closely aligns with the defect of **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**. The claim assumes popularity based simply on the assertion that everyone goes there, relying on popularity or common agreement as validation of the proposition.

Thus, the classification for the string is:
<s> = "That restaurant is popular because everyone in town goes there."
<IDA> of <s> = **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**.
