To apply the task of classifying the statement "<s>" to the given defective argument types step by step, we'll follow the structured approach defined as IDAA:

**Step 1: Identify the Argument Type of <s>**
   
First, let's analyze the given statement:
**"Encourages the audience to become part of a group or act because other people are acting in the same way."**

We need to determine which defective argument type this description aligns with among the following: Generalization (<G>), Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>), Inconclusive Reason (<IR>), Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>), Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>), Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>), or Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>).

**Step 2: Analyze Description**

Let's break down the given statement:

**"Encourages the audience to become part of a group or act because other people are acting in the same way."**

- Encourages the audience → advocacy or persuasion
- Join a group or act → action driven by behavior
- Because others are doing it → rationale based on popularity

**Step 3: Match with Definitions**

Next, we map the description to the defective argument types:

- <G> (Generalization): Assertion applicable to all based on a part or majority → Not relevant to peer pressure or popularity.
- <FE> (Incomplete Enumeration): Claiming complete possibilities while missing some → Not relevant to popularity.
- <IR> (Inconclusive Reason): Reason not conclusively demonstrating correctness → Not related to trend-following.
- <RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition): Reason says the same as proposition → No repetition here.
- <WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis): Weak or non-compelling causal argument → Not relevant to popularity.
- <FU> (Presumptuous Consensus): Assumed certainty based on universal agreement → Directly matches the description of urging based on others’ actions.
- <DEP> (Ambiguous Language Use): PR taken in another sense than intended → Not related to context ambiguity.

**Step 4: Conclusion**

From the analysis, the statement most closely aligns with the definition of <FU> (Presumptuous Consensus):

- This type involves encouraging someone to join in or act because a larger group is doing so, assuming that the consensus or behavior validates the action.

**Final Classification: <FU>**

Thus, the argument type for the string "<s>": "Encourages the audience to become part of a group or act because other people are acting in the same way." is classified as:

**FU** (Presumptuous Consensus)
