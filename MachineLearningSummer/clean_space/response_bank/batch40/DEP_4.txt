For 
To apply <IDAA> to the task of classifying the argument, "It is immoral to kill an innocent human being. Fetuses are innocent human beings. Therefore, it is immoral to kill fetuses," we will decompose the task (<t>) of classifying this argument into specific steps (<D>). Let's proceed step by step:

### Step 1: Identify the Elements of the Argument
Break down the argument into its basic componentsâ€”Proposition (<P>), Reason (<R>), and Proof of <R> (<PR>).

- **Proposition (<P>):** "It is immoral to kill fetuses."
- **Reason (<R>):** "Fetuses are innocent human beings."
- **Proof of <R> (<PR>):** "It is immoral to kill an innocent human being."

### Step 2: Determine if the Proposition (<P>) Has Defects
Evaluate the Proposition (<P>) to see if it falls into any of the defective argument categories:
- **Generalization (<G>):** Assertion based on some or a majority but not all
  - No, this is not a generalization.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):** Claim of complete enumeration but missing possibilities
  - No, this does not enumerate possibilities.

Conclusion: The Proposition (<P>) does not have defects of type <G> or <FE>.

### Step 3: Determine if the Reason (<R>) Has Defects
Evaluate the Reason (<R>) to see if it falls into any of the defective argument categories:
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):** <R> does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of <P>
  - The reason provided is, "Fetuses are innocent human beings," which does support the proposition based on the provided definitions.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** Weak causal basis for <P>
  - The reason given ("Fetuses are innocent human beings") is logically tied to the proposition ("it is immoral to kill fetuses") given the initial principle that it is immoral to kill an innocent human being.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):** <R> repeats the same as <P>
  - The Reason does not simply restate the Proposition without adding information.

Conclusion: The Reason (<R>) does not have defects of type <IR>, <WCB>, or <RR>.

### Step 4: Determine if the Proof of <R> (<PR>) Has Defects
Evaluate the Proof of <R> (<PR>) to see if it falls into any of the defective argument categories:
- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** Assuming certainty because "it is universally agreed upon"
  - The statement "It is immoral to kill an innocent human being" seems to be taken as a given, but it doesn't claim universal agreement explicitly.
  - It could be argued that the moral principle is generally accepted and could thus be close to <FU> if it assumes universal moral consensus without additional support.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):** Can be taken in another sense than intended
  - The language does not appear to be ambiguous as intended.

Conclusion: The Proof of <R> (<PR>) does not have defects of type <DEP> but could potentially be argued to lean towards <FU> if one questions the universal acceptance of the moral principle without further justification.

### Step 5: Final Classification
Based on the steps and evaluations, the argument does not clearly fit into any of the defective argument types <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <WCB>, <RR>, or <DEP>. However, there is a potential for it to be considered <FU> if the moral principle is in dispute and relies on presumed universal consensus. Thus:

**Classification: Potential <FU>** (Presumptuous Consensus)

This final step indicates that the argument might rely on the presumed universal moral principle without additional support, which aligns with <FU>.
