For 
To classify the given string "Get Verizon--1 billion people can't be wrong." using the process <IDAA> (the application of decomposition to the task of classifying defective arguments), we will break down the steps to identify which defect, among <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>, best fits the argument presented.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition

**Step 1: Identify the Proposition (P) and Reason (R)**

- **Proposition (P):** "Get Verizon"
- **Reason (R):** "1 billion people can't be wrong"

**Step 2: Examine the Reason (R) to see if it matches any defective argument types**

1. **Generalization (<G>):** 
   - Check if (P) is an assertion based on one part or majority and referred to all.
   - "Get Verizon" does not look like a generalization based on specific parts or individuals.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):**
   - Check if (P) omits some possibilities.
   - "Get Verizon" does not imply enumeration of possibilities directly.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):**
   - Check if (R) fails to conclusively demonstrate (P).
   - "1 billion people can't be wrong" is intended to demonstrate that Verizon is a good choice but does not provide a conclusive basis for (P) beyond popularity.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):**
   - Check if (R) does not strongly support (P).
   - "1 billion people can't be wrong" provides a weak causal basis as popularity alone is not compelling evidence of quality.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):**
   - Check if (R) repeats (P) in different words.
   - "1 billion people can't be wrong" does not simply restate "Get Verizon."

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):**
   - Check if (R) assumes agreement because of the number of people.
   - "1 billion people can't be wrong" assumes the correctness of (P) based on the large number of users, which fits the definition of <FU>.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):**
   - Check if (PR) is ambiguous.
   - The language in "1 billion people can't be wrong" is not ambiguous but rather clear in presenting the consensus argument.

**Step 3: Classify String (s)**

Based on the analysis, the Reason (R) "1 billion people can't be wrong" fits best with the defective argument type:

- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):** The argument assumes that because a large number of people use Verizon, it must be the correct choice, which is a logical fallacy appealing to popularity.

### Conclusion
The classification for the string "Get Verizon--1 billion people can't be wrong." is:

- **<FU> (Presumptuous Consensus)**
