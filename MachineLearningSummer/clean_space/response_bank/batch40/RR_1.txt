For 
To apply IDAA (the decomposition of the task of classifying the string as one of the specific defective argument types), we will break down the task into specific steps as follows:

1. **Identify the proposition (_P_):**
   - The statement "Paranormal activity is real" is the proposition. It sets forth what the speaker intends to prove.

2. **Identify the reason (_R_):**
   - The statement "because I have experienced what can only be described as paranormal activity" is the reason. It provides the causal basis for the proposition.

3. **Classify the argument type based on defects in _P_:**
   - _G_ (Generalization): The proposition does not make a generalization about a group or category.
   - _FE_ (Incomplete Enumeration): The proposition is not attempting to enumerate all possibilities.

4. **Classify the argument type based on defects in _R_:**
   - _IR_ (Inconclusive Reason): The reason provided is based on personal experience and thus lacks conclusive proof or evidence that is universally accepted. The reasoning here is subjective and relies solely on the speaker's personal experience.
   - _WCB_ (Insufficient Causal Basis): The subjective experience of the speaker does not provide strong or compelling evidence for the truth of the proposition.
   - _RR_ (Faulty Repetition of Proposition): This is not the case because the reason is not a direct repetition of the proposition.

5. **Classify the argument type based on defects in _PR_:**
   - Since we are not given corroborative proof (_PR_) in this specific string, we skip this classification.
   - However, if we were to elaborate, a presumptuous consensus (_FU_) or ambiguous language use (_DEP_) would not apply based on the provided string.

**Conclusion:**
Given the analysis of the reason (_R_), the argument defect that best classifies this string is:

- **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason):** The reason given (personal experience of the speaker) does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition that paranormal activity is real. Personal anecdotes, being subjective, do not provide universally accepted evidence.

Therefore, the task of classifying the string "Paranormal activity is real because I have experienced what can only be described as paranormal activity" fits the defect type <IR> (Inconclusive Reason).
