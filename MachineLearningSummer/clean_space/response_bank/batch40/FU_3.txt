For 
To apply the process ⟨IDAA⟩ to the string "Officer, I was only driving as fast as everyone around me. I'm sure I wasn't speeding.", we will decompose the advanced task ⟨IDA⟩ into specific steps. These steps will allow us to classify the given string as one of the defective argument types ⟨G⟩, ⟨FE⟩, ⟨IR⟩, ⟨RR⟩, ⟨WCB⟩, ⟨FU⟩, or ⟨DEP⟩.

### Step 1: Identify the Proposition (⟨P⟩) and Reason (⟨R⟩)

In the given string:
- **Proposition (⟨P⟩)**: "I wasn't speeding."
- **Reason (⟨R⟩)**: "I was only driving as fast as everyone around me."

### Step 2: Evaluate the Proposition and Reason

Evaluate if the given reason ⟨R⟩ suffices to establish the truth of the proposition ⟨P⟩, and check if it falls into any of the defective argument categories.

#### Analysis:
- The speaker argues that their speed was justified because it matched the speed of the surrounding drivers (proposition supported by reason).

### Step 3: Compare against Defective Argument Types

#### Type ⟨G⟩ (Generalization)
- This does not apply, as the argument is not generalizing a group characteristic but rather justifying an individual action by comparison to others.

#### Type ⟨FE⟩ (Incomplete Enumeration)
- This does not apply as no exhaustive enumeration of possibilities is presented or implied as complete.

#### Type ⟨IR⟩ (Inconclusive Reason)
- This does not apply because while the argument might use irrelevant justification in theory, it is considered insufficient rather than inconclusive.

#### Type ⟨RR⟩ (Faulty Repetition of Proposition)
- This does not apply because the Reason is not a mere repetition of the Proposition.

#### Type ⟨WCB⟩ (Insufficient Causal Basis)
- This does not apply because it is not related to the inadequacy of causal explanations.

#### Type ⟨FU⟩ (Presumptuous Consensus)
- This applies here, as the argument presumes that because everyone else is doing it (driving at a high speed), it is acceptable for them as well. This is often referred to as the bandwagon fallacy or appeal to popularity.

#### Type ⟨DEP⟩ (Ambiguous Language Use)
- This does not apply as the language used is clear and unambiguous.

### Conclusion
- The given string "Officer, I was only driving as fast as everyone around me. I'm sure I wasn't speeding." is classified as type ⟨FU⟩ (Presumptuous Consensus).

So, ⟨IDAA⟩ applied to the string results in the classification: **⟨FU⟩ (Presumptuous Consensus)**.
