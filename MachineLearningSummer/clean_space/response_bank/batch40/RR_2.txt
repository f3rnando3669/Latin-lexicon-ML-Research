For 
To apply the task <IDAA> to the statement "We need to fix our broken judicial system by electing new people. This logical fallacy is called...", we will decompose the task of classifying the string as one of the defective argument types into specific steps. These steps will help us determine the fallacy type accurately.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>)**: 
   - Determine what is being proposed or claimed in the statement.
   - In this statement: 
     - **Proposition (<P>)**: "We need to fix our broken judicial system by electing new people."
     
2. **Identify the Reason (<R>)**: 
   - Determine the causal basis or reasoning that supports the proposition.
   - In this case, the reason could be implicit (i.e., the broken state of the judicial system necessitates new elections).

3. **Examine the Defects in <P>**:
   - Check if <P> contains any generalization or incomplete enumeration.
   - Is the claim "Our judicial system is broken" a generalization?
     - While this could be deploying a subjective and generalized view without substantial evidence, it does not explicitly carry the hallmark of a generalization fallacy because it directs the focus on "electing new people."

4. **Examine the Defects in <R>**:
   - Check if <R> is inconclusive, insufficient, or repetitive.
   - Is the reasoning to "fix a broken system by electing new people" inconclusive?
     - **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The reason does not provide a concrete link between the action of electing new people and how it will fix the system. It assumes causation without evidence.
   - Is the causation suggested insufficient?
     - **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):** The statement assumes that electing new people will directly fix the system without providing substantive causal evidence that this will indeed solve the problem.

5. **Examine the Proof (<PR>)**:
   - Determine if the proof is presumptuous or ambiguous.
   - The statement lacks detailed proof entirely, focusing instead on the proposal.
   - Since the proof aspect is not developed, defects in proof do not directly apply.

### Classification

Based on the examination steps:

- **Primary Defective Argument Type Identified**:
  - **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The statement "We need to fix our broken judicial system by electing new people" does not provide a compelling causal basis, as it does not explain specifically how electing new people will mend the judicial system's issuesâ€”it merely asserts it.

### Conclusion

The logical fallacy in the argument "We need to fix our broken judicial system by electing new people" primarily falls under the **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)** category because the causal link between the proposed action (electing new people) and the intended outcome (fixing the judicial system) is weak and unsubstantiated.
