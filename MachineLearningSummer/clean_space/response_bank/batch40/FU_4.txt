For 
Let's apply the process of <IDAA> to classify the string "Everyone else is doing it, so should you." Here is the step-by-step decomposition of the task:

1. **Identify the Task <IDA>:** The task is to classify the given string using the defined types: <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>.

2. **Analyze the String:**
   - The string "Everyone else is doing it, so should you" suggests that a certain action should be taken because it is being widely practiced by others.

3. **Evaluate Against Definitions:**
   - **<G> (Generalization):** This is not simply a broad assertion about a group; it’s attempting to influence behavior based on what others are doing.
   - **<FE> (Incomplete Enumeration):** This string does not claim a complete enumeration of possibilities.
   - **<IR> (Inconclusive Reason):** The reason given is not evaluated by the nature of who is saying it but rather by the popularity of the action.
   - **<WCB> (Insufficient Causal Basis):** This string does not provide a causal basis for an argument.
   - **<RR> (Faulty Repetition of Proposition):** This string does not merely repeat the proposition as the reason.
   - **<FU> (Presumptuous Consensus):** This suggests that an action is valid simply because many people are doing it (appeal to popularity).
   - **<DEP> (Ambiguous Language Use):** The language here is not ambiguous; it’s clear and direct.

4. **Match with Type:**
   - The string fits the definition of <FU> (Presumptuous Consensus) as it uses the argument that an action should be carried out because it is what others are doing, which is an attempt to validate based on popularity.

So, applying <IDAA> to the string "Everyone else is doing it, so should you" results in classifying it as:
```
<FU>
```
