For 
To apply **IDAA** to the string "Don't you want the best for your baby?", we'll begin by breaking down the advanced task **IDA** (classifying the string as one of the defective argument types: **G**, **FE**, **IR**, **RR**, **WCB**, **FU**, or **DEP**) into specific steps. 

### Decomposition of Task **(D)**:
1. **Identify Proposition (P):** Identify the core statement or proposition being put forth.
2. **Identify Reason (R):** Determine if a reason is provided that supports the proposition.
3. **Identify Proof of Reason (PR):** Check for evidence or proof substantiating the reason.
4. **Classify the Defective Argument:** Based on the characteristics of the argument, classify which defective argument type it fits into (G, FE, IR, RR, WCB, FU, DEP).

### Step-by-Step Application of Decomposition to **IDA**:

#### Step 1: Identify Proposition (P)
- In this case, the statement "Don't you want the best for your baby?" implicitly assumes an underlying proposition: "You should do (or believe) X because you want the best for your baby."

#### Step 2: Identify Reason (R)
- The reason is implied: the best action for your baby correlates to agreeing to or doing a suggested action, though this action is not specified.

#### Step 3: Identify Proof of Reason (PR)
- There is no explicit proof or evidence given that describes what "the best" is or why it necessarily supports a particular action.

#### Step 4: Classify the Defective Argument

- Let’s evaluate possible types of defective arguments:
  - **G (Generalization):** Not applicable as there is no broad generalization based on an insufficient sample.
  - **FE (Incomplete Enumeration):** Not applicable as it mentions no enumeration of choices.
  - **IR (Inconclusive Reason):** There is no specific reason or causal basis here to evaluate conclusiveness.
  - **RR (Faulty Repetition):** Not applicable as the reason is not just repeating the proposition.
  - **WCB (Insufficient Causal Basis):** Without detail, there is no causal basis here at all.
  - **FU (Presumptuous Consensus):** Applicable. The statement implicitly appeals to a universal desire (best for your baby), implying that the proposed action must naturally follow from this consensus.
  - **DEP (Ambiguous Language Use):** Not applicable. There’s no ambiguous language or wordplay involved.

Given the implicit appeal to a commonly held desire without further substantiation or specifics, the argument appears to be appealing to a presumptive unanimous agreement on wanting the best for one’s baby. This fits as a **Presumptuous Consensus (FU)**.

### Conclusion
The string "Don't you want the best for your baby?" is classified as **FU (Presumptuous Consensus)**.
