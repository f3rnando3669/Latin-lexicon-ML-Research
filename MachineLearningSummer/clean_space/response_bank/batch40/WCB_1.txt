For 
To apply the process of <IDAA> to the string "The reason Donald Trump got elected was because liberals took political correctness too far," we must decompose the advanced task of classifying the string into specific steps and then execute these steps.

### Decomposition of Task <t> (Classification <IDA> into Specific Steps)

1. **Identify the parts of the argument**: Determine the `Proposition` (<P>), the `Reason` (<R>), and any `Proof of Reason` (<PR>).
2. **Check for defects in Proposition (<P>)**: Determine if <P> exhibits **Generalization** (<G>) or **Incomplete Enumeration** (<FE>).
3. **Check for defects in Reason (<R>)**: Determine if <R> exhibits **Inconclusive Reason** (<IR>), **Insufficient Causal Basis** (<WCB>), or **Faulty Repetition of Proposition** (<RR>).
4. **Check for defects in Proof of Reason (<PR>)**: Determine if <PR> exhibits **Presumptuous Consensus** (<FU>) or **Ambiguous Language Use** (<DEP>).

### Application of Steps to the Given String

#### Step 1: Identify the parts of the argument
- **Proposition** (<P>): "Donald Trump got elected."
- **Reason** (<R>): "liberals took political correctness too far."

#### Step 2: Check for defects in Proposition (<P>)
- **Generalization** (<G>): Not applicable. The proposition does not seem to generalize from a part or majority to a whole.
- **Incomplete Enumeration** (<FE>): Not applicable. The proposition does not claim to enumerate all possibilities.

#### Step 3: Check for defects in Reason (<R>)
- **Inconclusive Reason** (<IR>): **Applicable**. The reason given ("liberals took political correctness too far") does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition ("Donald Trump got elected"). It is an opinion-based causal claim rather than a definitive causal link.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis** (<WCB>): **Applicable**. The causal basis provided is weak and not compelling enough to establish the truth of the proposition. Claiming that "liberals took political correctness too far" without providing more robust evidence or context does not adequately support why "Donald Trump got elected."
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition** (<RR>): Not applicable. The reason provided is different from the proposition itself and does not simply repeat it.

#### Step 4: Check for defects in Proof of Reason (<PR>)
- **Presumptuous Consensus** (<FU>): **Applicable**. The provided reason assumes a consensus about liberals taking political correctness too far without substantiating this claim or proving that it's a universally agreed-upon fact.
- **Ambiguous Language Use** (<DEP>): Not applicable. The language in the provided reason is clear in the context it is used.

### Conclusion
The string "The reason Donald Trump got elected was because liberals took political correctness too far." exhibits the following defects:

- **Inconclusive Reason** (<IR>)
- **Insufficient Causal Basis** (<WCB>)
- **Presumptuous Consensus** (<FU>)

Therefore, the classification of the string under <IDA> would include <IR>, <WCB>, and <FU>.
