For 
To apply <IDAA> to the provided string "Three kids in one class failed the Jane Eyre quiz, I guess, all the other classes will all fail it, too.," we need to perform a decomposition of the task of classifying the type of defective argument and then step-by-step apply this process to identify the specific type.

### Step 1: Understand the Proposition <P>
First, identify the proposition in the argument.
- Proposition (<P>): "all the other classes will all fail it, too."

### Step 2: Identify the Reason <R>
Next, identify the reason provided for the proposition.
- Reason (<R>): "Three kids in one class failed the Jane Eyre quiz."

### Step 3: Examine the Argument Structure
Determine if the argument presented is defective by examining the structure and logic behind the Reason (<R>), and how it supports the Proposition (<P>).

### Step 4: Apply Defective Argument Types
Based on the structuring of <P> and <R>, we apply the definitions of the known defective argument types:
1. **<G>: Generalization** - Assertion based on some one part or on a majority of individuals but generalized to all.
2. **<FE>: Incomplete Enumeration** - Claim to have made a complete enumeration of possibilities, but miss out on some.
3. **<IR>: Inconclusive Reason** - Reason does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition.
4. **<RR>: Faulty Repetition of Proposition** - Reason appears to just restate the proposition without adding causual evidence.
5. **<WCB>: Insufficient Causal Basis** - Reason presented is not compelling or convincing enough.
6. **<FU>: Presumptuous Consensus** - Assuming something is true because it is universally agreed upon.
7. **<DEP>: Ambiguous Language Use** - Language that can be taken in another sense than the speaker intended.

### Step 5: Match the Defective Argument Type
Matching the identified elements from Steps 1-4, determine the defect type of the argument.

- The proposition "all the other classes will all fail it, too" is based on the performance of just three kids in one class.
- The assertion applies the failure of a small, specific group (three kids) to a much larger group (all the other classes).

### Classification of <s> as Type <G> (Generalization)
The argument "Three kids in one class failed the Jane Eyre quiz, I guess, all the other classes will all fail it, too." fits the definition of Generalization where the proposition is based on an assertion grounded on one part or a majority, but not necessarily applicable to all, is referred to the whole.

Therefore, the classification is:
```
<s> == <G>
```

The argument "Three kids in one class failed the Jane Eyre quiz, I guess, all the other classes will all fail it, too." is of the defective argument type **<G>: Generalization**.
