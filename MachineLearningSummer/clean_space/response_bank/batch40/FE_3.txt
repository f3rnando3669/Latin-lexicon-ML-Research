For 
To apply **<IDAA>** to the statement "People either like coffee or hate it," we need to decompose the task of identifying the defect in the argument using the defined steps.

1. **Identify the Proposition** (<P>):
   - The statement "People either like coffee or hate it" is our proposition.

2. **Determine if the Proposition is Defective**:
   - Check against the types of defects in <P>: Generalization (<G>) and Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>).

3. **Classify the Defective Type**:
   - **Generalization (<G>)**: "All sports car drivers are too aggressive!" is an example of <G>, which asserts something about a group based on a limited observation.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: "Vote for Smith or live through four more years of higher taxes." is an example of <FE>, which implies there are only two options when there might be more.

4. **Analyze the Proposition**:
   - "People either like coffee or hate it" implies there are only two possible attitudes towards coffee, which may ignore other potential views such as indifference or neutrality.

5. **Match the Defect**:
   - The proposition suggests a binary choice without considering other possibilities, leading to an incomplete set of options.

6. **Conclude the Classification**:
   - The statement "People either like coffee or hate it" fits the definition of Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>) because it does not account for all pertinent possibilities such as being indifferent or having a mixed opinion about coffee.

Therefore, the correct classification for the statement "People either like coffee or hate it" using **<IDAA>** is **<FE> (Incomplete Enumeration)**.
