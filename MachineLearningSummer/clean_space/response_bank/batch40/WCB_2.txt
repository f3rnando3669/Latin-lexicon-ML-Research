To apply IDAA to the given argument by Farmer McDonald, we'll break down the advanced task (t) of classifying the argument into specific steps (D). Each step will address a component of the argument and identify if it matches one of the defective argument types: Generalization (<G>), Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>), Inconclusive Reason (<IR>), Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>), Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>), Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>), or Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>).

### Step-by-Step Decomposition

1. **Identify Proposition (<P>), Reason (<R>), and Proof of Reason (<PR>):**
   - Proposition (<P>): "Mankind has got too big for its britches when it fiddles around with nature."
   - Reason (<R>): "Ever since they put up that new power plant across the river, we haven't had a bit of rain."
   - Proof of Reason (<PR>): Not explicitly provided; it's implied the lack of rain is evidence.

2. **Classify Any Defects in Proposition (<P>):**
   - Check for Generalization (<G>): Does <P> make an unwarranted universal claim based on insufficient evidence?
     
     "Mankind has got too big for its britches when it fiddles around with nature." - This is a broad generalization with very little evidence provided. 
     
     **Classification:** <G>

     **Reasoning:** The statement is a sweeping generalization about mankind's interaction with nature based on a limited observation.

3. **Classify Any Defects in Reason (<R>):**
   - Check for Inconclusive Reason (<IR>): Does <R> definitively support <P>?
     
     "Ever since they put up that new power plant across the river, we haven't had a bit of rain." - There’s no clear causal link established between the construction of the power plant and the lack of rain. It’s a temporal correlation but doesn’t prove causation.
     
     **Classification:** <IR>
     
     **Reasoning:** The reason given does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition. The lack of rain could be caused by many other factors unrelated to the power plant.

   - Check for Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>): Is the causal basis weak?
     
     **Classification:** <WCB>
     
     **Reasoning:** The reasoning provided is weak because it relies on a temporal association rather than a compelling causal relationship.

4. **Classify Any Defects in Proof of Reason (<PR>):**
   - Check for Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>): Is there an unjustified assumption of universal agreement?
     
     There’s no explicit consensus appeal in the argument provided.
     
     **Classification:** Not applicable.

   - Check for Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>): Is there ambiguous language in the argument?
     
     The language is clear and specific in its context.
     
     **Classification:** Not applicable.

### Final Classification
- **Generalization (<G>)**: The statement is an unwarranted sweeping generalization.
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: The reason does not definitively support the proposition.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The causal connection is weak and unsupported by strong evidence.

Thus, applying IDAA to the given argument, we classify it with defects of type <G>, <IR>, and <WCB>.
