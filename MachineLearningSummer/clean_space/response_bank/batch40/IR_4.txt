For 
Applying <IDAA> to classify the string according to the specified defective argument types involves the following steps:

### Step 1:  Identify the Proposition (<P>), Reason (<R>), and Proof (<PR>)

#### String Breakdown:
- **Proposition (<P>)**: The string provides a discussion on the "moving the goalposts" fallacy in arguments for the existence of God.
- **Reason (<R>)**: The reason seems to be that as science progresses, arguments for the existence of God are replaced by new ones.
- **Proof (<PR>)**: The proof involves examples like the transition from creationism to intelligent design and the current argument about the origin of life.

### Step 2: Determine if there is any recognized defect within the disclosed Proposition (<P>), Reason (<R>), or Proof (<PR>)

#### Investigation of <P>:
- This does not immediately seem like a defective <P> (Generalization or Incomplete Enumeration). 

#### Investigation of <R>:
- The discussion about shifting arguments as science progresses may not clearly fall under Inconclusive Reason (<IR>), Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>), or Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>).

#### Investigation of <PR>:
- Further consideration for defects like Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>) or Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>).

### Step 3: Analyze in detail the given string for types <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, and <DEP>.

#### Review:

1. **Generalization (<G>)**: The string does not appear to generalize a particular group's behavior unreasonably.
   
2. **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: The string does not limit individuals to two choices from a potentially larger set.

3. **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: This can be tricky as it depends on whether the provided reasoning is viewed as sufficient. The argument may be a form of weak reasoning against the overall proposition but does not specifically label an incorrect reason used for <P>.

4. **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: Again, this is subjective depending on acceptance of the causality presented, but there isn't a significant example claiming weak causal evidence explicitly.

5. **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: The argument itself is not restating the proposition as its reasoning.

6. **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: Key phrases to note:
   - "Currently the origin of life is a popular argument for God (although a classic argument from ignorance)".
   - "We very well may have a scientific answer in the next decade."
   - This marks an assumption shared among general scientific community expectations and opinions, hinting it is universally agreed that scientific advancement will further disprove these arguments.

7. **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**: No apparent ambiguous language in the technical sense as used here was observed.

### Step 4: Classification

Through the detailed analysis, the most fitting classification from the defective argument types described is:
- **<FU> (Presumptuous Consensus)**: The string assumes that understanding and answers through science are universally agreed upon and that religious arguments will continually be disproved as a rule, reflecting a consensus on scientific progression debunking theological claims.

Thus, the classification <IDAA> applied to the string results primarily in:

**Type**: **<FU> (Presumptuous Consensus)**
