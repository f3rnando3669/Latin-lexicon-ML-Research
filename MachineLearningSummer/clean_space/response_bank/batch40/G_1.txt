For 
To apply the process of IDAA (the application of decomposition to the task of classifying a statement as one of the given defective argument types), we need to break the task down into specific, systematic steps and then work through each. Here are the steps we'll follow:

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):** Determine the main assertion or claim made in the string.
   
2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):** Determine the causal or supporting statement that backs up the Proposition.
   
3. **Check for Defects in <P>:** Assess if the Proposition has any defects falling into the categories of Generalization (<G>) or Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>).

4. **Check for Defects in <R>:** Evaluate if the Reason supporting the Proposition has any defects such as Inconclusive Reason (<IR>), Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>), or Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>).

5. **Check for Defects in <PR>:** Determine if there is a defect in the Proof of Reason, considering Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>) and Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>).

6. **Classify the Defective Argument:** Based on the defects identified, classify the string into one of the defined defective argument types.

Now, letâ€™s apply these steps to the given string:

*String: "I heard that the Catholic Church was involved in a sex scandal cover-up. Therefore, my 102-year-old Catholic neighbor, who frequently attends Church, is guilty as well!"*

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):** 
   - The main claim is: "my 102-year-old Catholic neighbor, who frequently attends Church, is guilty as well."

2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   - The supporting statement is: "I heard that the Catholic Church was involved in a sex scandal cover-up."

3. **Check for Defects in <P>:** 
   - *Generalization (<G>):* The Proposition asserts that because the Catholic Church was involved in a scandal, it applies to an individual neighbor. This takes a single instance or group behavior and generalizes it to an individual within that group.
   - *Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):* Not applicable as the Proposition does not involve an enumeration of possibilities.

4. **Check for Defects in <R>:**
   - *Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):* The Reason does not conclusively support the claim. Involvement of some members of the Catholic Church does not prove the guilt of every individual Catholic.
   - *Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):* The causal connection between the Catholic Church cover-up and the guilt of the neighbor is weak.
   - *Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):* Not applicable here; the Reason is different from the Proposition.

5. **Check for Defects in <PR>:**
   - *Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):* Not applicable, as this defect involves assuming consensus rather than logical proof.
   - *Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):* Not applicable since the language is not ambiguous in its interpretation.

6. **Classify the Defective Argument:**
   - The argument fits the defect type of *Generalization (<G>)*, as it incorrectly generalizes the behavior of a group to an individual member of that group.
   - Additionally, it shows characteristics of *Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)* because the Reason cited does not conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the Proposition.

### Conclusion:
The string "I heard that the Catholic Church was involved in a sex scandal cover-up. Therefore, my 102-year-old Catholic neighbor, who frequently attends Church, is guilty as well!" exhibits the defective argument types of **Generalization (<G>)** and **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**.
