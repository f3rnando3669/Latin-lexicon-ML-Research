For 
To apply the IDAA (the application of decomposition to the task of classifying a string into a defective argument type) to the provided argument, we will break the task down into specific steps and perform each step in sequence.

Here is the argument:
"Speaker 1: We are using thousands of people, who are going door to door to help us spread the word about social injustice and the need for change.
Speaker 2: Well then, I can’t be a part of this because I was always been taught that it’s wrong to use people."

Step 1: Identify the Proposition (P) and Reason (R) in the Argument

- **Proposition (P)**: This is the claim presented by Speaker 2: "I can’t be a part of this."
- **Reason (R)**: This is the causal basis provided by Speaker 2 for their Proposition: "because I was always been taught that it’s wrong to use people."

Step 2: Analyze the Reason (R) for Defective Argument Types

We will now classify the Reason (R) "because I was always been taught that it’s wrong to use people" based on the defined defective argument types:

- **Generalization (G)**: This applies if the Reason is based on asserting that a generalization is true for all cases. Not applicable here.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (FE)**: This applies if the Reason claims completeness but misses some possibilities. Not applicable here.
- **Inconclusive Reason (IR)**: This applies if the Reason does not conclusively support the Proposition. Possibly applicable.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**: This applies if the Reason is weak in terms of the causal basis submitted. Possibly applicable.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)**: This applies if the Reason is simply repeating the Proposition. Not applicable here.

Step 3: Examine the Reason for Specific Defective Argument Types

Let's further scrutinize if the Reason fits **Inconclusive Reason (IR)** or **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**:

**Inconclusive Reason (IR)**:
- The Reason "because I was always been taught that it’s wrong to use people" does not demonstrably challenge the actual activity of spreading awareness about social injustice. The assertion is based on a teaching or belief rather than an examination of the specific context of the Proposition.

**Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**:
- The causal basis submitted (being taught that it’s wrong) is personal and does not directly address the ethical considerations of using people for raising awareness on social issues. Hence, this reason is weak for supporting the avoidance of involvement in the stated activity.

Step 4: Conclude the Classification

Both **IR** (Inconclusive Reason) and **WCB** (Insufficient Causal Basis) are potentially valid classifications. We see that the Reason provided does not conclusively support the Proposition and presents a weak causal basis.

Step 5: Finalize and Classify as One Defective Argument Type

Given the analysis, the most fitting classification for the Reason (R) "because I was always been taught that it’s wrong to use people" is **Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)**, as it presents a weak argument without strong causal support.

**Final Classification: WCB (Insufficient Causal Basis)**
