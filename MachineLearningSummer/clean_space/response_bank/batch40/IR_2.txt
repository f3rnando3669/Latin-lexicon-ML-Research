For 
To apply <IDAA> (the application of task decomposition to the task of classifying a defective argument), we'll break down the task into specific steps and classify the given string. Here's the string we need to classify: `"My best friend says you’re a liar, so I’m not going to talk to you."`

### Step-by-Step Decomposition

1. **Understand the Argument Structure**:
   - Identify the Proposition (<P>), Reason (<R>), and Proof of Reason (<PR>) within the string.

2. **Recognize Possible Types of Defective Arguments**:
   - Review definitions of <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <WCB>, <RR>, <FU>, and <DEP>.

3. **Classify the Defective Argument**:
   - Compare the argument against definitions and examples of each defective argument type.

### Step 1: Understand the Argument Structure

- **Proposition (<P>)**: "I’m not going to talk to you."
  - This is the conclusion that the speaker is presenting.
  
- **Reason (<R>)**: "My best friend says you’re a liar."
  - This is the justification provided for the <P>.

- **Proof of Reason (<PR>)**: Not explicitly present in the string. The statement does not provide further evidence or arguments to support the reason.

### Step 2: Recognize Possible Types of Defective Arguments

- **<G> Generalization**: An overreaching statement that applies to all based on a part.
  - Example: "All sports car drivers are too aggressive."
  
- **<FE> Incomplete Enumeration**: Claiming to have covered all possibilities without doing so.
  - Example: "Vote for Smith or live through four more years of higher taxes."
  
- **<IR> Inconclusive Reason**: The reason does not conclusively support the proposition.
  - Example: "We cannot listen to John’s opinion on global warming because he is a tree hugger."
  
- **<WCB> Insufficient Causal Basis**: Weak causal relationship provided for the proposition.
  - Example: "I had a real bad headache, then saw my doctor. Just by talking with him, my headache started to subside, and I was all better the next day."
  
- **<RR> Faulty Repetition of Proposition**: The reason is merely a repetition of the proposition.
  - Example: "This legislation is sinful because it is the wrong thing to do."
  
- **<FU> Presumptuous Consensus**: Assuming something to be true because it is universally agreed upon.
  - Example: "Everybody knows that staying out in the rain can make you sick."
  
- **<DEP> Ambiguous Language Use**: Language that can be interpreted in another way than intended.
  - Example: "Make the yuletide gay."

### Step 3: Classify the Defective Argument

We need to classify the given string `"My best friend says you’re a liar, so I’m not going to talk to you."`

- **Generalization (<G>)**: Does not fit, as the statement is not asserting something based on a part applied to all.
- **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>)**: Not applicable, no enumeration of possibilities is involved.
- **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>)**: Potential candidate. The reason provided is that the best friend’s opinion is being used as the basis for the proposition, which is an attempt to appeal to authority rather than a conclusive reason.
- **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: Not applicable, no weak causal relationship is being described explicitly.
- **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>)**: Not applicable, the reason and proposition are distinct.
- **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>)**: Not applicable, no consensus or universal agreement is claimed.
- **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>)**: Not applicable, the language is clear and unambiguous.

### Conclusion

The defective argument type that best classifies the given string is **<IR> Inconclusive Reason**.

**Classification: <IR> Inconclusive Reason**.
