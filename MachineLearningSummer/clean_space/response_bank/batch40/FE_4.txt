For 
To apply the process of IDAA (the application of the decomposition of an advanced task into specific steps) to the task of classifying the given string "I thought you were a good person, but you weren’t in class today." as one of the defective argument types, we need to follow a structured approach. Here is the step-by-step breakdown of this process:

1. **Identify the Proposition (P)**:
   - This is the statement or assertion that is being made. In the given string, the proposition appears to be: "I thought you were a good person."

2. **Identify the Reason (R)**:
   - This is the justification or causal basis provided for the proposition. In the given string, the reason seems to be: "but you weren’t in class today."

3. **Analyze the Structure**:
   - Here's the structure of the statement:
     - Proposition (P): "I thought you were a good person."
     - Reason (R): "but you weren’t in class today."
   
4. **Classify the Defective Argument Type**:
   - We need to classify the reason based on the defined defective argument types (G, FE, IR, RR, WCB, FU, DEP).

**Step-by-Step Classification**:

1. **Is it a Generalization (G)?**
   - No, this statement is not making a universal generalization based on limited examples. It is more about an expectation not being met.

2. **Is it an Incomplete Enumeration (FE)?**
   - No, this statement is not presenting a limited set of options or possibilities.

3. **Is it an Inconclusive Reason (IR)?**
   - This looks plausible. The reason provided ("you weren’t in class today") does not conclusively demonstrate that the person is not a good person. Missing a class could be due to various reasons that do not impact overall character.

4. **Is it Insufficient Causal Basis (WCB)?**
   - Potentially. The causal basis (not being in class) is weak in supporting the proposition (not being a good person). It's insufficient to establish the claim convincingly.

5. **Is it a Faulty Repetition of Proposition (RR)?**
   - No, the reason is not merely a restatement of the proposition.

6. **Is it a Presumptuous Consensus (FU)?**
   - No, there is no appeal to a popular consensus or universal agreement in this statement.

7. **Is it an Ambiguous Language Use (DEP)?**
   - No, there is no ambiguous language use in this statement that could mislead the interpretation.

**Conclusion**:
Given the above analysis, the most fitting classification for this statement is either IR (Inconclusive Reason) or WCB (Insufficient Causal Basis). Both reflect the fact that the provided reason does not adequately support the proposition.

The final classification:
- <IR> (Inconclusive Reason): "I thought you were a good person, but you weren’t in class today."
