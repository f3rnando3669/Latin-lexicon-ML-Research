For 
To apply the process of <IDAA> (decomposing and analyzing the classification task) to the string "You either support Hillary Clinton for President or you don't believe in women's rights", we will follow these steps:

### Step 1: Understand <IDA>
<IDA> is the task of classifying the string <s> as one of the identified defective argument types: <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>.

### Step 2: Decompose the Task <IDA> into Specific Steps (<D>)
   
1. **Identify and Understand the Proposition (<P>):**
   - What is the main claim being asserted in the argument?
   
2. **Identify and Understand the Reason (<R>):**
   - What is the reasoning or basis given to support the proposition?

3. **Analyze Each Defective Argument Type in Relation to <P> and <R>:**
   - Generalization (<G>): Check if the proposition is unjustifiably extrapolated to all cases.
   - Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>): Evaluate if the proposition presents a false dichotomy or incomplete options.
   - Inconclusive Reason (<IR>): Assess if the reason provided does not adequately support the proposition.
   - Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>): Determine if the reason merely repeats the proposition.
   - Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>): Examine if the causal link provided is weak or unconvincing.
   - Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>): Investigate if the proof assumes consensus without evidence.
   - Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>): Look for ambiguous terms that can be misunderstood.

### Step 3: Apply This Decomposition to the Given String

1. **Identify the Proposition (<P>):**
   - Proposition: "You either support Hillary Clinton for President or you don't believe in women's rights."
   
2. **Identify the Reason (<R>):**
   - Implied Reason: Supporting Hillary Clinton is equated with believing in women's rights.

3. **Analyze Each Defective Argument Type:**
   - **Generalization (<G>):**
     - Not applicable. The argument does not generalize a specific observation to all cases.
   
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>):**
     - Applicable. The argument presents a false dichotomy, suggesting that "you either support Hillary Clinton or you don't believe in women's rights," which fails to acknowledge other possible positions such as supporting womenâ€™s rights but preferring another candidate.
   
   - **Inconclusive Reason (<IR>):**
     - Not applicable. It is not about the conclusiveness of the reason but the structure of the options given.

   - **Faulty Repetition of Proposition (<RR>):**
     - Not applicable. The reason does not repeat the proposition.

   - **Insufficient Causal Basis (<WCB>):**
     - Not applicable. The argument is not presenting a weak causal basis but rather a dichotomous choice.

   - **Presumptuous Consensus (<FU>):**
     - Not applicable. There's no assumption of universal agreement being made here.

   - **Ambiguous Language Use (<DEP>):**
     - Not applicable. The language used is not ambiguous, but rather the structure is faulty.

### Step 4: Final Classification of the String
Based on the decomposition and analysis of the task, the string "You either support Hillary Clinton for President or you don't believe in women's rights" fits the definition of Incomplete Enumeration (<FE>).

**Classification: <FE>**
