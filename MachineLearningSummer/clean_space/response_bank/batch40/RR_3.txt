To apply the concept of IDAA to the given string, we need to classify the argument as one of the defective argument types. Let's break down the process step-by-step using the definition of IDAA:

### Step 1: Identify the Components of the Argument
- **Proposition (P)**: Jesus was not really crucified.
- **Reason (R)**: The Quran says so.
- **Proof of Reason (PR)**: The Quran is the Word of God, and everything it says is true.

### Step 2: Examine for Defects in Each Component
1. **Examine P for Defects like G or FE**
   - In this case, "Jesus was not really crucified" does not appear to be a generalization or an incomplete enumeration. So, it's not G or FE.

2. **Examine R for Defects like IR, WCB, or RR**
   - The Reason (R) given is "The Quran says so."
   - This does not present a logical basis that conclusively supports the proposition; it is an assertion relying on the authority of a religious text, which may or may not be accepted universally, falling into:
     - **IR (Inconclusive Reason)** since the assertion "The Quran says so" does not necessarily conclusively demonstrate the correctness of the proposition "Jesus was not really crucified."
   - Additionally, the argument relies heavily on the religious belief that "the Quran is the Word of God" which can be taken as:
     - **RR (Faulty Repetition of Proposition)** because it essentially repeats the initial assertion in another form without providing new evidence: "The Quran says so" and "The Quran is the Word of God."

3. **Examine PR for Defects like FU or DEP**
   - The PR states "The Quran is the Word of God, and everything it says is true."
   - This entire segment restates the argument's proposition with additional assertion about the Quran's infallibility without new evidence:
     - **FU (Presumptuous Consensus)** could be this context as it is assuming the Quran's divinity and infallibility is universally agreed upon, which is still in dispute.

### Step 3: Classify the Entire String (s) Based on Defects Identified

Upon evaluating each part of the argument, we can identify:
- The Reason (R) component exhibits defects that align with **IR (Inconclusive Reason)** and potentially **RR (Faulty Repetition of Proposition)** as both parts of the argument simply restate the initial assertion from different perspectives.
- The Proof (PR) component seems to assume a consensus that the Quran is infallible without providing external evidence, which could be classified under **FU (Presumptuous Consensus)**.

### Result
The argument string can be classified primarily under **IR (Inconclusive Reason)** and has elements of **RR (Faulty Repetition of Proposition)** and **FU (Presumptuous Consensus)**.

Therefore, the correct classification of the given argument string is: **IR**, **RR**, and **FU**.
