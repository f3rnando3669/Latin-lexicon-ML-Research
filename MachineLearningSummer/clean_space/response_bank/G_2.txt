For 
Let's apply the decomposition steps to identify the defective argument type of the given string:

### Example String (s):
"It is warmer this year in Las Vegas as compared to last year; therefore, global warming is rapidly accelerating."

### Step-by-Step Decomposition:

**Step 1: Read and Understand the Argument**
   - Carefully read the given string to grasp the argument being made.
   - The argument suggests that because it is warmer in Las Vegas this year compared to last year, global warming is rapidly accelerating.

**Step 2: Identify the Core Proposition**
   - Core proposition: "Global warming is rapidly accelerating."

**Step 3: Analyze the Reasoning**
   - Reasoning provided: The acceleration of global warming is deduced from the observation that it is warmer in Las Vegas this year compared to last year.

**Step 4: Match with Defective Argument Types**
   - Compare the reasoning and structure of the argument against the definitions of the defective argument types:
     - <G> Claims a general truth based on a specific instance.
     - <FE> Lists fewer or more options than actually exist.
     - <IR> Provides a reason that doesn't logically support the proposition.
     - <RR> Repeats the same idea in different words.
     - <WCB> Offers a non-compelling reason.
     - <FU> Asserts universally agreed points without proof.
     - <DEP> Uses statements open to dual interpretations.
   
   - The reasoning in this argument attempts to generalize a global condition (global warming) based on a local instance (temperature change in Las Vegas). Specifically, it draws a broad conclusion about global warming trends from a specific and isolated observation made in one location over a short period.

**Step 5: Make a Determination**
   - The defective argument type for the given string is best classified as <G>: claiming a general truth based on a specific instance.

### Conclusion

By applying the steps of decomposition to <IDA>, we efficiently determine that the argument in the string "It is warmer this year in Las Vegas as compared to last year; therefore, global warming is rapidly accelerating." is of type <G> â€“ claiming a general truth (rapid acceleration of global warming) based on a specific instance (warmer year in Las Vegas).
