For 
Let's apply the decomposition steps defined in <D> to the argument given in the string <s>:

### Given Argument:
"Officer, I was only driving as fast as everyone around me. I'm sure I wasn't speeding."

### Application of <D> to <IDA> (<IDAA>):

1. **Read and Understand the Argument**:
   - We carefully read the given string to comprehend its context and content.

2. **Identify the Key Proposition**:
   - The main claim or proposition here is: "I wasn't speeding."

3. **Analyze the Reasoning**:
   - The support provided for the main claim ("I wasn't speeding") is: "I was only driving as fast as everyone around me."

4. **Match Against Known Defective Argument Types**:
   a. **Generalization (<G>)**: Is the argument claiming a general truth based on a specific instance? 
      - No, it’s not making a generalized statement.
   b. **False Enumeration (<FE>)**: Is the argument listing fewer or more options than actually exist?
      - No, it doesn’t present a limited or exaggerated number of choices.
   c. **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>)**: Is the reasoning provided not logically supporting the proposition?
      - Let's consider this. The reasoning here is: "I was only driving as fast as everyone around me." This doesn’t logically support the claim "I wasn't speeding," because even if everyone else was speeding, it doesn't make speeding legal or acceptable. This reasoning is irrelevant to whether the person was actually speeding.
   d. **Redundant Reason (<RR>)**: Is the reasoning saying the same thing as the proposition but in other words?
      - No, it doesn't restate the proposition in another form.
   e. **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: Is the reason compelling enough to support the claim?
      - No, the argument’s reasoning is more irrelevant than weakly compelling.
   f. **False Universals (<FU>)**: Is the argument asserting universally agreed points without proof?
      - No, it does not assert universally accepted notions.
   g. **Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>)**: Is the statement open to dual interpretations, potentially against the speaker?
      - No, it does not present an ambiguity that leaves it open to dual meanings.

5. **Select the Closest Match**:
   - From the above analysis, the closest and most appropriate match is **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>)**. The reason provided does not logically support the proposition that the individual wasn’t speeding; it merely shifts attention to the behavior of others.

6. **Justify Your Choice**:
   - The justification for identifying this argument as <IR> is based on the fact that the argument provides a reason (others were driving fast) that is not relevant to the main claim (that the individual wasn’t speeding). The speed of other drivers does not justify or negate the fact of someone’s speeding. Thus, it fails to logically support the proposition.

### Conclusion:
The defective argument type in the given string "Officer, I was only driving as fast as everyone around me. I'm sure I wasn't speeding." is **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>)**.
