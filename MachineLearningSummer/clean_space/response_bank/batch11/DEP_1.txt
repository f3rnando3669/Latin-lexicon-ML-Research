For 
Certainly! Let's apply the steps for **Identifying Defective Arguments** (<IDAA>) to the given string:

**Given string <s>**: "When the judge asked the defendant why he hadn't paid his parking fines, he said that he shouldn't have to pay them because the sign said 'Fine for parking here' and so he naturally presumed that it would be fine to park there."

### Step 1: Understand the Argument

- **Proposition**: The defendant believes he shouldn't have to pay the fines.
- **Reason given**: The sign saying "Fine for parking here" was interpreted to mean that parking there was acceptable.

### Step 2: Match the Argument to a Defective Type

- Let's break down the argument:
  - The argument hinges on the interpretation of the word "fine." The defendant interprets it as meaning "acceptable" rather than understanding its intended meaning of a monetary penalty.
  
  - This type of argument involves exploiting the dual interpretation of a phrase to support an argument.

### Step 3: Verify the Classification

- **Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>)**: This type specifically deals with statements open to dual interpretations, potentially against the speaker.
  - The argument's core is about the dual interpretation of the word "fine."
  - The defendant uses this ambiguous wording to justify not paying the parking fines.

### Step 4: Label the Argument
- Based on the verification, the argument can be classified as **Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>)**.

Therefore, the defective argument type for the given string is **Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>)**.
