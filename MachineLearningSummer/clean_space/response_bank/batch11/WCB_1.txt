To identify the defective argument type in the string "The reason Donald Trump got elected was because liberals took political correctness too far," we'll apply the decomposition method (IDAA) as outlined.

### Step-by-step decomposition (D) of the task:

1. **Comprehend the Argument (CA):**
   - Understanding the content: The argument posits that Donald Trump’s election was due to an overextension of political correctness by liberals.

2. **Identify the Argument Features (IAF):**
   - The argument involves a causal relationship between two factors: Trump’s election and the actions of liberals concerning political correctness.

3. **Compare with Defective Argument Types (CDAT):**
   - <G> (Generalization): Doesn't fit since the argument isn’t making a broad generalization based on a specific instance.
   - <FE> (False Enumeration): Doesn't fit because the argument isn’t listing limited options.
   - <IR> (Inappropriate Reason): Might fit as there is a question whether political correctness by liberals could solely justify Trump’s election.
   - <RR> (Redundant Reason): Doesn't fit because the argument isn’t merely restating itself.
   - <WCB> (Weak Causal Basis): Might fit as the reasoning provided might not be compelling enough to explain the complex phenomenon of a presidential election.
   - <FU> (False Universals): Doesn't fit because the argument doesn’t rely on universally agreed points without proof.
   - <DEP> (Double-Edged Phrases): Doesn't fit as there isn’t an issue with dual interpretation in this context.

4. **Select the Most Accurate Defective Argument Type (SADAT):**
   - The determining factor here is whether the reasoning is strong enough to support the proposition.
   - Considering the complexity of electoral outcomes compared to the simplification offered in the argument, <WCB> (Weak Causal Basis) seems the most fitting.

5. **Verify the Choice (VC):**
   - To verify, cross-reference with examples: The idea that a single factor (liberals taking political correctness too far) can explain a complex event like a presidential election fits well with the notion of a weak causal basis.

### Application (IDAA):

By going through the steps systematically, we conclude that the defective argument type for the string "The reason Donald Trump got elected was because liberals took political correctness too far" is:

**<WCB> (Weak Causal Basis)**

The argument provides a reason that is not compelling enough to adequately support the proposition, making it a weak causal basis for explaining Trump’s election.
