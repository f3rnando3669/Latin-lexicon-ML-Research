For 
To apply <IDAA> (the decomposition of the task of identifying defective arguments) to the statement "It is immoral to kill an innocent human being. Fetuses are innocent human beings. Therefore, it is immoral to kill fetuses," we will follow the structured steps outlined earlier:

### Steps for Task IDAA (Applying Decomposition to Identifying Defective Arguments)

1. **Read and Understand Statement:**
   - Carefully read the statement: "It is immoral to kill an innocent human being. Fetuses are innocent human beings. Therefore, it is immoral to kill fetuses."
   - Understand the claim: The argument states a moral principle, applies it to a specific group (fetuses), and draws a conclusion based on this application.

2. **Identify Key Features of the Argument:**
   - Key statements include:
     - It is immoral to kill an innocent human being.
     - Fetuses are innocent human beings.
     - Therefore, it is immoral to kill fetuses.
   - This appears to be a syllogistic argument where a general moral principle is applied to a specific case.

3. **Match Against Definitions:**
   - Check the argument characteristics against the types of defective arguments:
     - **Generalization (G):** Not applicable, since the argument does not make a sweeping generalization based on a single instance.
     - **False Enumeration (FE):** Not applicable, since the argument does not list fewer or more options than actually exist.
     - **Inappropriate Reason (IR):** Not applicable, since the reasons seem logically connected to the conclusion.
     - **Redundant Reason (RR):** Not applicable, as the argument does not restate the proposition but rather presents premises leading to a conclusion.
     - **Weak Causal Basis (WCB):** Not applicable, as the argument does not present a weak causality.
     - **False Universals (FU):** Not applicable, as the argument does not attempt to appeal to universally agreed points without proof.
     - **Double-Edged Phrases (DEP):** Not directly applicable, as the argument does not use statements open to dual interpretations.

4. **Check for Ambiguities:**
   - Confirm that the statement does not fit multiple categories. The argument appears logically valid at first glance, matching a syllogistic structure rather than a known fallacious type.

5. **Assign the Correct Type:**
   - On further inspection: The statement appears to be structurally a legitimate syllogism. However, if we base our task strictly on identifying defective arguments, it may not fit neatly into any of the provided defective argument types, as it appears to be a logically sound deductive argument.

6. **Validation:**
   - Comparing with examples doesn't highlight any clear fallacious reasoning in this case.

### Conclusion

Applying the well-outlined steps of <IDAA> to this statement, it does not clearly fit any of the defective argument types (G, FE, IR, RR, WCB, FU, DEP). It seems to present a logically structured syllogistic argument rather than a defective one. Therefore, based on the definitions provided, we can conclude that this particular argument does not exemplify any of the predefined defective argument types.
