### Application of IDAA to the Given Statement:

Statement: "Encourages the audience to become part of a group or act because other people are acting in the same way."

1. **Parse the Statement**:
   - Understand that the core of the argument is the encouragement to join or act based on others' behaviors.

2. **Identify Components**:
   - Main Claim/Action: Encourages to become part of a group or to perform an action.
   - Reason: Because other people are acting in the same way.

3. **Cross-reference**:
   - Compare the identified components against the definitions of defective argument types:
     - Generalization: No specific instance is generalizing a broad claim here.
     - False Enumeration: No listing of options or limitation thereof.
     - Inappropriate Reason: The reason seems to support the claim but needs to establish its appropriateness.
     - Redundant Reason: Doesn't merely rephrase the proposition.
     - Weak Causal Basis: Not arguing with weak causality; rather focuses on peer actions.
     - **False Universals (FU):** Asserting the action should be done because everyone else is doing it.
     - Double-Edged Phrases: No dual interpretations here.

4. **Match with Templates**:
   - This fits the template for False Universals:
     - "Stating that something should be done (or agreed to) because everyone else thinks this way."
     - "You appealed to popularity or the fact that many people do something as an attempted form of validation."
     - "Everybody else is doing it, why don't you?"

5. **Diagnose the Defect**:
   - Type: False Universals (FU)

### Conclusion:

The given statement "Encourages the audience to become part of a group or act because other people are acting in the same way" is a False Universal (FU).
