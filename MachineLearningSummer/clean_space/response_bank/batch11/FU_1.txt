For 
Let's apply the structured breakdown (<D>) to the task of identifying the defective argument type (<IDAA>) for the string "Get Verizon--1 billion people can't be wrong."

### Applying Decomposition (<IDAA>) Steps

**Step 1: Understanding the Argument**
- **Analyze**: The argument suggests that Verizon is a good choice because 1 billion people have chosen it, implying that their choice is correct.

**Step 2: Identifying the Proposition and Reasoning**
- **Proposition**: Verizon is the right choice (or you should get Verizon).
- **Reasoning**: The fact that 1 billion people have chosen Verizon.

**Step 3: Classifying the Reasoning**
- **Nature of Reasoning**: The argument relies on the popularity of Verizon (the fact that many people are using it) as evidence for its correctness or desirability.

**Step 4: Mapping to Defective Argument Types**
- **Compare with Known Types**:
  - **False Universals (<FU>)**: This type asserts universally agreed points without proof, often relying on popularity or widespread belief as validation.
  - The reasoning here is that because 1 billion people have chosen Verizon, it must be the right or best choice, which aligns with the concept of appealing to popularity.

**Step 5: Conclusion**
- **Type of Defective Argument**: **False Universals (<FU>)**.

### Conclusion

The argument "Get Verizon--1 billion people can't be wrong." represents a defective argument type called **False Universals (<FU>)**, as it uses the popularity of Verizon (1 billion users) to validate the proposition, without providing substantive evidence beyond the number of users.
