Sure, let's apply the process of identifying the defective argument in the string "Three kids in one class failed the Jane Eyre quiz, I guess all the other classes will all fail it, too." using the steps of <IDAA>.

**String <s>:** "Three kids in one class failed the Jane Eyre quiz, I guess all the other classes will all fail it, too."

### Steps for Decomposition (<D>):

1. **Step 1:** Examine the structure of the argument in the string.
2. **Step 2:** Identify the example being used to support the conclusion.
3. **Step 3:** Assess whether the example logically supports the general conclusion.
4. **Step 4:** Match the structure of the argument to one of the defined defective argument types.

### Application:

1. **Step 1:** The string presents a specific instance (three kids failing a quiz) and extends this to make a general prediction (other classes will fail).
2. **Step 2:** The specific instance is "three kids in one class failed the Jane Eyre quiz".
3. **Step 3:** The argument concludes that "all the other classes will all fail it, too" based on the performance of a few students in a single class. This does not logically follow because the performance of three kids in one class does not provide a sufficient basis to predict the outcomes for all other classes.
4. **Step 4:** This argument form matches the definition of **Generalization (<G>)**. It attempts to claim a general truth (that all the other classes will fail) based on a specific instance (three kids in one class failed).

Therefore, the defective argument present in the string "Three kids in one class failed the Jane Eyre quiz, I guess all the other classes will all fail it, too." is **<G>**, which stands for Generalization.
