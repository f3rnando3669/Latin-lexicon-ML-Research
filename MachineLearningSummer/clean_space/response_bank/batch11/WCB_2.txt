For 
Let's apply the decomposition of the identification of defective arguments (IDAA) to the given string: "Farmer McDonald: Ever since they put up that new power plant across the river, we haven't had a bit of rain. I'm tellin' you, mankind has got too big for its britches when it fiddles around with nature."

### Decomposition of Task (D)

1. **Understanding the Argument**:
   - **Read and Comprehend**: The speaker, Farmer McDonald, is claiming that the lack of rain is directly caused by the construction of a new power plant and asserting that human interference with nature is to blame.

2. **Classifying the Argument**:
   - **Pattern Recognition**: The speaker is attributing a cause (the new power plant) to an effect (lack of rain) without sufficient evidence to support this cause-effect relationship.
   - **Key Indicators**: Phrases like "Ever since they put up that new power plant" and "we haven't had a bit of rain" indicate a perceived cause-effect relationship.

3. **Applying the Definitions**:
   - **Match to Definitions**:
     - **<G> Generalization**: This argument is not primarily about generalizing from a specific instance but rather attributing a specific cause to an effect.
     - **<FE> False Enumeration**: No enumeration is involved in this claim.
     - **<IR> Inappropriate Reason**: The reason provided (new power plant causing no rain) does not logically support the larger proposition about mankind fiddling with nature.
     - **<RR> Redundant Reason**: The reason provided is not simply restating the proposition in different words.
     - **<WCB> Weak Causal Basis**: The argument provides a perceived causal relationship (new power plant causing no rain) without compelling evidence.
     - **<FU> False Universals**: The argument does not rely on universal claims or popularity.
     - **<DEP> Double-Edged Phrases**: No ambiguous or double interpretations are present in the argument.
   - **Best Match**: The argument best fits the category of **Weak Causal Basis** (<WCB>), as it is attributing the new power plant to the lack of rain without sufficient evidence.

4. **Verification**:
   - **Consistency Check**: The classification as <WCB> aligns with the characteristics of offering a weak reason for a supposed effect.
   - **Alternative Consideration**: The argument might be seen as an Inappropriate Reason (<IR>), but <WCB> is more precise as it deals specifically with weak causal claims.

Therefore, the defective argument type for the string "Farmer McDonald: Ever since they put up that new power plant across the river, we haven't had a bit of rain. I'm tellin' you, mankind has got too big for its britches when it fiddles around with nature." is identified as <WCB> (Weak Causal Basis).
