For 
To apply **<IDAA>** to the given string "That restaurant is popular because everyone in town goes there.", we will follow the steps outlined in the task definitions:

### Decompose the Task (<D>):

1. **Identify the Premise and Conclusion**:
   - **Premise**: Everyone in town goes to the restaurant.
   - **Conclusion**: The restaurant is popular.

2. **Compare Against Definitions**:
   - **Generalization (<G>)?**
     - No, this is not making a broad statement based on a specific instance.
   - **False Enumeration (<FE>)?**
     - No, it is not presenting a limited or exhaustive list of options.
   - **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>)?**
     - No, the reason provided here is related to the context (popularity based on attendance).
   - **Redundant Reason (<RR>)?**
     - No, it is not just rephrasing the proposition.
   - **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>)?**
     - No, the reasoning here is not inherently weak; it is a common correlation for popularity.
   - **False Universals (<FU>)?**
     - Yes, it asserts a universal point without proof: it assumes that just because everyone goes there, the restaurant is popular without providing evidence beyond that assertion.
   - **Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>)?**
     - No, it does not involve dual interpretations.

### Identify Argument Type (<IDA>):

Based on the decomposition step, the argument provided in the string "That restaurant is popular because everyone in town goes there" fits into:

- **False Universals (<FU>)**: It asserts that the restaurant's popularity is solely because everyone goes there, without providing additional evidence or proof for why the restaurant is popularâ€”just that attendance equals popularity.

Hence, by applying **<IDAA>** to the string, we identify the argument type as **<FU> - False Universals**.
