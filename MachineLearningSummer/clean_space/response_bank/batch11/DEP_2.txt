For 
Let's apply the IDAA (the decomposition of the task IDA into specific steps) to the given statement:

**Statement (s):**
- "Speaker 1: We are using thousands of people, who are going door to door to help us spread the word about social injustice and the need for change.
- Speaker: Well then, I can’t be a part of this because I was always been taught that it’s wrong to use people."

### Step 1: Understand the Argument
- The first speaker is explaining the use of volunteers to spread awareness about social injustice. The second speaker rejects participation based on the interpretation of the term "using people."

### Step 2: Identify the Key Components
- **Claim/Proposition** (by the second speaker): "I can't be a part of this."
- **Reason/Evidence** (by the second speaker): "I was always been taught that it’s wrong to use people."

### Step 3: Compare with Argument Types
- **<G> (Generalization)**: Claims a general truth based on a specific instance.
- **<FE> (False Enumeration)**: Lists fewer or more options than exist.
- **<IR> (Inappropriate Reason)**: Provides a reason that doesn't logically support the proposition.
- **<RR> (Redundant Reason)**: Says the same thing as the proposition but in other words.
- **<WCB> (Weak Causal Basis)**: Offers a reason that is not compelling enough to support the proposition.
- **<FU> (False Universals)**: Asserts universally agreed points without proof.
- **<DEP> (Double-Edged Phrases)**: Uses statements open to dual interpretations.

### Step 4: Match Defective Argument Type
- The argument hinges on the interpretation of the phrase "using people." The second speaker interprets it negatively (exploiting individuals), while the first speaker is using it in the context of enlisting volunteers for a positive cause. This dual interpretation fits:
  - **<DEP> (Double-Edged Phrases)**: Uses statements open to dual interpretations.

### Step 5: Validate the Identification
- Re-examine the argument. The rejection to participate is based on an interpretation of the phrase "using people" that differs from its intended meaning by the first speaker, indicating a misunderstanding due to the dual nature of the phrase.

### Conclusion:
The argument: 
- "Speaker 1: We are using thousands of people, who are going door to door to help us spread the word about social injustice and the need for change.
- Speaker: Well then, I can’t be a part of this because I was always been taught that it’s wrong to use people."
  
has been identified as:
- **Defective Argument Type**: <DEP> (Double-Edged Phrases)
