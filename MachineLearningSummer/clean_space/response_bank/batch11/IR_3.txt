For 
Applying <IDAA> to the given argument, we proceed with the following steps:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition and Identification

**Step 1: Reading and Understanding**  
Read and understand the argument presented:

- The argument discusses the "moving the goalposts" fallacy in the context of arguments for the existence of God.
- It explains how some arguments for the existence of God change as scientific understanding evolves, using the transition from creationism to intelligent design as an example.
- It mentions the possibility of the origin of life argument being replaced as science progresses.
- The "moving the goalposts" analogy is illustrated with an example from American football.

**Step 2: Identify Key Elements**  
Identify the key elements of the argument:

- The main focus is the idea that arguments for God shift as scientific knowledge increases.
- Specific terms like "moving the goalposts," "creationism," "intelligent design," and "origin of life" highlight the shifting nature of the argument.
- An emphasis is placed on how changing arguments make it difficult to provide definitive proof.

**Step 3: Comparison to Definitions**  
Compare the identified elements to the provided definitions of defective argument types:

- **Generalization (<G>)**: This argument is not making a broad generalization based on a specific instance.
- **False Enumeration (<FE>)**: The argument is not listing fewer or more options than actually exist.
- **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>)**: The argument doesn't rely on reasoning that doesn't logically support the proposition.
- **Redundant Reason (<RR>)**: The argument is not restating the proposition in different words.
- **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The argument is not weakened by a lack of compelling causal reasoning.
- **False Universals (<FU>)**: The argument is not based on universally accepted points without proof.
- **Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>)**: The argument does not use statements open to dual interpretations.

**Step 4: Match Defective Argument Type**  
The argument does not perfectly fit any of the prespecified defective argument types (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>). However, the argument described – "moving the goalposts" – is indeed a recognized fallacy where the criteria for proof are changed to ensure the proposition cannot be refuted. This specific fallacy is characterized by shifting standards.

**Step 5: Validation**  
None of the given defective argument codes directly correspond to "moving the goalposts," which is typically about shifting the standards of proof or requirements to disprove an assertion. Therefore, this argument highlights a different type of fallacy not covered by the provided list.

In this case, identifying the argument type "moving the goalposts" confirms that while the provided defective argument types are comprehensive, they do not encompass every possible fallacy. This application illustrates the need for an exhaustive list of argument types when performing such classifications.

### Conclusion
The specific fallacy "moving the goalposts" does not fall under the predefined defective argument types provided (i.e., <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>). It is a distinct fallacy where the criteria for proof are continuously adjusted to prevent the proposition from being disproven.

Therefore, in applying <IDAA> to the given argument, we conclude that this argument demonstrates the "moving the goalposts" fallacy, which is not one of the provided categories.
