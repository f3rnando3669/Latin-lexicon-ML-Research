For 
To apply <IDAA> to the given string "My best friend says you’re a liar, so I’m not going to talk to you," we will follow the defined steps of decomposition.

### Steps for <IDAA>:

1. **Understand the Argument**:
   - Main proposition: "I’m not going to talk to you."
   - Supporting reason: "My best friend says you’re a liar."

2. **Identify Supporting Evidence or Reasoning**:
   - The supporting reason given is the opinion of the speaker's best friend, which is used to justify why the speaker will not talk to "you."

3. **Classify the Type of Defective Argument**:
   - **Generalization (<G>)**: The argument does not claim a general truth based on a specific instance.
   - **False Enumeration (<FE>)**: The argument does not list fewer or more options than actually exist.
   - **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>)**: The reason provided (best friend's opinion) may not logically support the proposition (refusal to talk).
   - **Redundant Reason (<RR>)**: The supporting reason is not a rephrased version of the proposition.
   - **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The causal link between the best friend's accusation and the decision not to talk might be weak.
   - **False Universals (<FU>)**: The argument does not assert universally agreed points without proof.
   - **Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>)**: The statement does not appear to be open to dual interpretations that could backfire.

4. **Match the Defective Argument Type**:
   - **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>)**: The best friend's opinion alone does not provide a strong or logical reason to completely stop talking to someone. Instead of assessing the truth of the claim independently, it relies on an appeal to authority or relationship, which is an inappropriate justification.

5. **Justify Your Classification**:
   - The reason provided ("My best friend says you’re a liar") does not logically support the proposition ("I’m not going to talk to you"). The decision is based on hearsay or an appeal to the authority of the best friend's opinion rather than objective evidence or direct reasoning. Therefore, it fits the category of Inappropriate Reason (<IR>).

### Conclusion:
Based on the process, the string "My best friend says you’re a liar, so I’m not going to talk to you." is classified as **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>)** because the reason provided does not logically support the proposition and lacks sufficient justification.
