For 
To identify the type of defective argument in the string "People either like coffee or hate it." using the steps defined in <IDAA>, let's go through each step systematically:

1. **Analyze the structure of the argument:**
   - The statement presents a clear dichotomy: either one likes coffee, or one hates it.

2. **Determine whether the argument makes a generalization based on a specific instance:**
   - No, it is not making a generalization from a specific instance. It's presenting a binary choice.

3. **Check if the argument lists fewer or more options than actually exist:**
   - Yes, it presents only two extreme options (liking or hating coffee) without considering neutral or moderate positions (e.g., people who are indifferent to coffee or have mixed feelings about it).
   - **Classify as <FE> (False Enumeration)** because it lists fewer options than actually exist.

Since we have identified that the argument lists fewer options than actually exist in Step 3, we can conclude that the defective argument type for the string "People either like coffee or hate it." is:

**<FE> (False Enumeration)**
