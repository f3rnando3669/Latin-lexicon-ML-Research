For 
Let's apply the IDAA process to identify the defective argument in the string:

**String \( s \)**: "You either support Hillary Clinton for President or you don't believe in women's rights."

### Decomposing IDA as D:
**Step 1: Read the string carefully.**
- String \( s \): "You either support Hillary Clinton for President or you don't believe in women's rights."

**Step 2: Look for key indicators that point to different types of defective arguments.**
- The string presents two options: supporting Hillary Clinton or not believing in women's rights.

**Step 3: Compare the indicators found in Step 2 with the definitions provided above.**
- The string \( s \) is attempting to present only two options, ignoring any possible middle ground or other nuances.
- This indicator matches with <FE> (False Enumeration), which lists fewer or more options than actually exist.

**Step 4: Identify and label the defective argument type \( s \).**
- The string \( s \) "You either support Hillary Clinton for President or you don't believe in women's rights." is identified as having a defective argument of the type \( <FE> \) - False Enumeration.

### Conclusion:
- The defective argument type for the string \( s \) "You either support Hillary Clinton for President or you don't believe in women's rights." is \( <FE> \) - False Enumeration.
