For 
Let's apply the steps of identifying the type of defective argument (IDAA) to the statement “Everyone else is doing it, so should you.”

1. **Understand the Proposition:**
   - Proposition: You should do it.

2. **Identify the Supporting Reason:**
   - Reason: Everyone else is doing it.

3. **Classify the Defective Argument Type:**
   - The argument suggests that you should do something because others are doing it.

4. **Match with Definitions:**
   - **Generalization (<G>):** This type is not directly applicable here since it does not claim something about a whole group based on specific instances.
   - **False Enumeration (<FE>):** This type is not applicable as the statement does not list limited options.
   - **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>):** The reason (everyone else is doing it) does not logically support the proposition (you should do it) on its own merit.
   - **Redundant Reason (<RR>):** This does not apply because the reasoning is not merely a restatement of the proposition.
   - **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>):** This does not fit either, as it's not about a weak causal connection.
   - **False Universals (<FU>):** The argument relies on the idea that the action is valid because it is universally accepted or popular without substantial proof.
   - **Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>):** This does not apply since the statement is not open to dual interpretations.

5. **Determine the Defective Argument:**
   - The defective argument type that best describes the statement is **False Universals (<FU>)**.

6. **Document the Reasoning:**
   - The statement "Everyone else is doing it, so should you" fits the False Universals type because it asserts that the action should be taken simply because others are doing it, relying on popularity or presumed universal agreement as a form of validation.

Therefore, applying the IDAA method, the defective argument type for the statement “Everyone else is doing it, so should you” is **False Universals (<FU>)**.
