To apply <IDAA> (application of decomposition steps <D> to identifying the defective argument task <IDA>) to the given quote, we will follow each step systematically:

### Argument:
"I see nobody on the road," said Alice.  
"I only wish I had such eyes," the King remarked. "To be able to see Nobody! And at that distance, too! Why it's as much as I can do to see real people, by this light."

### Decomposition Steps (<D>):

1. **Reading and Understanding the Argument**:
   - Carefully read the provided string to understand the context and meaning.

2. **Identifying Key Components**:
   - Key phrases: "I see nobody on the road" and "To be able to see Nobody! And at that distance, too!"

3. **Classifying the Argument**:
   - Analyze how the key components fit within the predefined categories of defective arguments.

4. **Verifying the Classification**:
   - Cross-check with definitions to ensure the correct classification.

5. **Output the Argument Type**:
   - Assign the type of defective argument and produce the output.

### Applying the Decomposition Steps:

1. **Reading and Understanding the Argument**:
   - Alice states that she sees "nobody" on the road.
   - The King humorously interprets "nobody" as if it were a visible entity ("To be able to see Nobody! And at that distance, too!").

2. **Identifying Key Components**:
   - Alice: "I see nobody on the road."
   - The King: "To be able to see Nobody! And at that distance, too!"

3. **Classifying the Argument**:
   - The King's response emerges from an ambiguous interpretation of the word "nobody."
   - This leads to the King's humorous but illogical statement, misunderstanding "nobody" as a visible entity rather than referring to the absence of people.

4. **Verifying the Classification**:
   - This fits the definition of Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>), as it involves the ambiguity and dual interpretation of the word "nobody" leading to a response that plays on this ambiguity in a way that appears nonsensical.

5. **Output the Argument Type**:
   - The type of defective argument for the given text is <DEP>.

### Conclusion:
By following the systematic steps, we deduce that the argument type for the quote "I see nobody on the road," said Alice.  
"I only wish I had such eyes," the King remarked. "To be able to see Nobody! And at that distance, too! Why it's as much as I can do to see real people, by this light." is <DEP> due to the use of an ambiguous term leading to a dual interpretation.
