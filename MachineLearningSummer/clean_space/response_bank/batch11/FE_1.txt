### Application of Decomposed Steps to Argument Identification (<IDAA>)

Given:
```
<s> = "The museum's new gemstones and precious minerals exhibit needs more security guards. If you don't agree, then you must be planning to steal a piece of the exhibit."
```

Here's how we apply <D> to <IDA> (performing <IDAA>):

1. **Read and Understand the Argument:**
   ```
   "The museum's new gemstones and precious minerals exhibit needs more security guards. If you don't agree, then you must be planning to steal a piece of the exhibit."
   ```

2. **Identify Key Characteristics:**
   - The argument sets up a dichotomy: either you agree with needing more security guards, or you are planning to steal from the exhibit.

3. **Match with Defective Argument Type Descriptions:**
   - The key characteristic here is the presentation of two options while ignoring other possible reasonable alternatives (such as disagreeing for reasons unrelated to theft).

4. **Assign the Appropriate Defective Argument Type:**
   - Based on our definitions, this matches with <FE> (False Enumeration), as it lists fewer options than actually exist, creating a false dichotomy.

5. **Verify and Justify the Assignment:**
   - Justification: The argument falsely limits the possible positions to either agreeing with more security guards or being a potential thief. This ignores other possible legitimate positions and therefore fits the False Enumeration category.

Final Identification:
```
<s> = "<FE>"
```

Thus applying <IDAA>, the argument type identified for the given statement is <FE>.
