### Step-by-Step Decomposition and Identification (<IDAA>)

**Task:** Apply <IDAA> to "Speaker 1: Jesus was not really crucified.
Speaker 2: How do I know that’s true?
Speaker 1: Because the Quran says so.
Speaker 2: How do I know the Quran is correct?
Speaker 1: Because the Quran is the Word of God, and everything it says is true.
Speaker 2: How do I know that’s true?
Speaker 1: Because God tells us so, here in the Quran."

#### Step 1: Initial Identification
- **Read the argument carefully.**
  - The core proposition is that "Jesus was not really crucified."
  - The supporting reasons are that the Quran says so, and the Quran is the Word of God.

#### Step 2: Compare with Definitions
- **Generalization:** The argument is not broadly generalizing based on a single instance.
- **False Enumeration:** The argument does not limit options artificially.
- **Inappropriate Reason:** The primary reasons provided (Quran says it, Quran is God’s word) may not logically support the core proposition, but let's analyze further.
- **Redundant Reason:** The reasons provided are not merely rephrasing the proposition.
- **Weak Causal Basis:** The strength of the causal link (the Quran's assertions) is what needs deeper critique.
- **False Universals:** The argument does not assume universal truths without evidence, but instead relies on a specific authority (Quran).
- **Double-Edged Phrases:** The argument does not use ambiguous statements.

#### Step 3: Analyze Context and Structure
- **Contextual Analysis:**
  - The context is a religious debate on the reliability of scriptural texts.
- **Structural Analysis:**
  - Proposition: "Jesus was not really crucified."
  - Reason 1: "Because the Quran says so."
  - Justification for Reason 1: "Because the Quran is the Word of God, and everything it says is true."
  - Justification for Justification: "Because God tells us so, here in the Quran."

#### Step 4: Match to Definition
- Analyze if the reasons given are independently validated:
  - The argument inherently relies on circular reasoning because the Quran’s truth is validated by the Quran itself. Each support points back to its own premise without external verification.

#### Step 5: Confirm Identification
- **Double-check:**
  - The structure of reasoning revolves around affirming the validity of the Quran by the Quran itself, making it a circular argument (not explicitly covered by predefined argument types but often categorized under inappropriate reasoning due to logical insufficiency).

### Final Identification: <IR> (Inappropriate Reason)

The circular reasoning provided does not logically support the core proposition, thereby classifying it under inappropriate reasoning.
