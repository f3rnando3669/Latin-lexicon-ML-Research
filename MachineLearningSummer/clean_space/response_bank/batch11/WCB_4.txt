To identify the type of defective argument in the string "Every day, I eat cereal for breakfast. One time, I had a muffin instead, and there was a major earthquake in my city. I've eaten cereal ever since," we will apply the decomposition steps (IDAA) as follows:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (IDAA) for Identifying Defective Argument

#### Step 1: Read and Parse the Argument (RPA)
Read the statement carefully to understand its content and context:
- "Every day, I eat cereal for breakfast. One time, I had a muffin instead, and there was a major earthquake in my city. I've eaten cereal ever since."

This statement describes a habitual action (eating cereal for breakfast), a deviation from that action (eating a muffin), and a consequential event (a major earthquake).

#### Step 2: Identify Key Elements (IKE)
Identify key phrases or words that may indicate the type of defective argument:
- "Every day, I eat cereal for breakfast."
- "One time, I had a muffin instead, and there was a major earthquake in my city."
- "I've eaten cereal ever since."

The key element here is the inference of a causal relationship between eating a muffin and the occurrence of an earthquake. The statement implies that eating cereal somehow prevents earthquakes, which is an unsupported and weak causal connection.

#### Step 3: Classify Based on Definition (CBD)
Classify the statement based on the identified key elements and the predefined defective argument types:
- The argument suggests a correlation between eating a muffin and the occurrence of an earthquake, which is an exceedingly weak and unfounded causal basis. The inference made here does not logically or scientifically support the proposition.

Based on this analysis, the defective argument type is:
- **Weak Causal Basis (WCB)**: The offered reason (eating a muffin leading to an earthquake) is not compelling enough to support the conclusion.

### Final Classification
- **Classification: WCB (Weak Causal Basis)**

Therefore, the type of defective argument in the string "Every day, I eat cereal for breakfast. One time, I had a muffin instead, and there was a major earthquake in my city. I've eaten cereal ever since." is **Weak Causal Basis (WCB)**.
