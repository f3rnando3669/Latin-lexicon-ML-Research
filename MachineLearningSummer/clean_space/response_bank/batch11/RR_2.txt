To identify the type of defective argument present in the statement "We need to fix our broken judicial system by electing new people." using the advanced task decomposition approach, let's apply <IDAA> step-by-step.

### Steps for <IDAA> Applied to the Given Statement:

1. **Understand the Argument in <s>:**
   - The argument states that the judicial system is "broken" and proposes that "electing new people" is the solution to fixing it.

2. **Categorize the Argument Structure:**
   - Determine whether the argument is making a generalization, listing options, providing a reason, asserting causality, stating a universal fact, or using ambiguous phrasing.
   - In this case, it provides a reason for how to fix the judicial system.

3. **Match with Defective Argument Types (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>):**
   - **<G> Generalization:** Is the statement making a general claim based on specific instances? No.
   - **<FE> False Enumeration:** Is it listing limited options? No.
   - **<IR> Inappropriate Reason:** Is the provided reason logically supporting the proposition? No.
   - **<RR> Redundant Reason:** Is it saying the same thing as the proposition but in other words? No.
   - **<WCB> Weak Causal Basis:** Is the causal link or reasoning weak or not compelling? Potential match.
   - **<FU> False Universals:** Is it asserting a universal truth without evidence? No.
   - **<DEP> Double-Edged Phrases:** Is it using ambiguous statements open to dual interpretations? No.

   This matches primarily with **<WCB> Weak Causal Basis** because it offers a very simplistic and potentially unconvincing solution (electing new people) to a complex issue (fixing the judicial system) without substantiating how electing new people would address the system's problems.

4. **Assess the Quality of the Match:**
   - The argumentâ€™s suggestion that electing new people will fix the judicial system is not compelling or detailed enough to be convincing.
   
5. **Document and Justify the Identification:**
   - Document the identified defective argument type as **<WCB> Weak Causal Basis**.
   - **Justification:** The provided reason (electing new people) is a weak and oversimplified causal link to the proposed solution (fixing the broken judicial system). The argument lacks specifics on how new elections will directly fix the judicial system or what foundational changes would result from such elections.

### Conclusion:
The logical fallacy present in the statement "We need to fix our broken judicial system by electing new people." is best identified as **<WCB> Weak Causal Basis**.
