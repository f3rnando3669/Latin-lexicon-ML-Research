Sure, let's apply the process of <IDAA> to identify the defective argument type in the string "I thought you were a good person, but you weren’t in class today."

### Step 1: Parse the Statement
- The statement is: "I thought you were a good person, but you weren’t in class today."

### Step 2: Determine the Nature of the Claim
- The claim suggests a correlation between being a good person and attending class. It implies that not attending class disqualifies someone from being considered a good person.

### Step 3: Match the Claim to a Defective Argument Type
- Let's consider each defective argument type:

  - **<G> Generalization**: This statement doesn't seem to be making a generalization based on a single instance.
  
  - **<FE> False Enumeration**: This statement does not list fewer or more options than actually exist.
  
  - **<IR> Inappropriate Reason**: This type fits well because the reason (not being in class today) does not logically support the proposition (being a good person).
  
  - **<RR> Redundant Reason**: The statement is not restating the proposition in other words.
  
  - **<WCB> Weak Causal Basis**: This is also plausible because the causal relationship suggested (missing class implies not being a good person) is not compelling enough.
  
  - **<FU> False Universals**: The argument isn't asserting universal points without proof.
  
  - **<DEP> Double-Edged Phrases**: This does not appear to involve any ambiguity open to dual interpretations.

### Step 4: Validate the Classification
- **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>)**: The statement assumes that not attending class is sufficient evidence to determine that someone isn't a good person, which is logically unsound.
- **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: While this could be possible, the primary flaw here is more about the inappropriateness of using attendance as a measure of one's character, leaning more towards <IR>.

### Step 5: Return the Identified Type
- The defective argument type is **<IR> (Inappropriate Reason)**.

### Final Output
- The defective argument type identified for the statement "I thought you were a good person, but you weren’t in class today." is **<IR> (Inappropriate Reason)**.
