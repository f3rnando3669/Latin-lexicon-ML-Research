For 
To identify the type of defective argument in the given string "I heard that the Catholic Church was involved in a sex scandal cover-up. Therefore, my 102-year-old Catholic neighbor, who frequently attends Church, is guilty as well!" using the IDAA approach, let's break down the steps:

1. **Read and Understand <s>:**
   - The string posits that because there was a cover-up by the Catholic Church, an individual Catholic neighbor must also be guilty.

2. **Identify Key Components:**
   - **Proposition:** The 102-year-old Catholic neighbor is guilty.
   - **Reason:** The Catholic Church was involved in a sex scandal cover-up.

3. **List Possible Argument Types:**
   - Generalization (<G>)
   - False Enumeration (<FE>)
   - Inappropriate Reason (<IR>)
   - Redundant Reason (<RR>)
   - Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>)
   - False Universals (<FU>)
   - Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>)

4. **Match with Argument Types:**
   - The argument is based on a specific instance (the cover-up in the Catholic Church) and generalizes it to all members of the Catholic Church, including the neighbor.

5. **Evaluate and Confirm:**
   - This matches the characteristics of Generalization (<G>), which makes broad claims based on specific instances.

Thus, the defective argument type for the string "I heard that the Catholic Church was involved in a sex scandal cover-up. Therefore, my 102-year-old Catholic neighbor, who frequently attends Church, is guilty as well!" is identified as <G> (Generalization).
