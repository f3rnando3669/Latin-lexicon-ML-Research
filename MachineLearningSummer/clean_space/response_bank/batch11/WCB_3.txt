To identify the type of defective argument in the statement "I drank bottled water and now I am sick, so the water must have made me sick," let's apply the decomposition methodology previously outlined:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (D):

1. **Initial Reading and Comprehension:**
   - **D1:** Read the given argument string carefully.
     - Given string: "I drank bottled water and now I am sick, so the water must have made me sick."
   - **D2:** Identify the main proposition or claim made in the argument.
     - Main proposition: The sickness is caused by drinking bottled water.

2. **Analyzing the Content:**

   - **D3:** Determine if the argument is making a generalization based on a specific instance.
     - **G (Generalization):** Not applicable here; the argument does not generalize from a single instance to a broader claim.
   - **D4:** Examine if the argument is presenting limited or exaggerated options.
     - **FE (False Enumeration):** Not applicable; the argument is not presenting a false dichotomy or limited options.
   - **D5:** Verify if the reason provided supports the proposition logically.
     - **IR (Inappropriate Reason):** Not applicable; the reason provided is not irrelevant to the proposition.
   - **D6:** Check for redundancy in the reasoning.
     - **RR (Redundant Reason):** Not applicable; the reason is not simply restating the proposition.
   - **D7:** Assess the strength of the causal basis.
     - **WCB (Weak Causal Basis):** This could be applicable. The argument assumes a causal relationship between drinking bottled water and getting sick based on a temporal correlation without sufficient evidence to establish a strong causal link.
   - **D8:** Look for universal claims without proper proof.
     - **FU (False Universals):** Not applicable; the argument does not make a universal claim.
   - **D9:** Identify any phrases open to dual interpretations.
     - **DEP (Double-Edged Phrases):** Not applicable; the argument does not use phrases susceptible to multiple interpretations.

3. **Classification:**
   - **D10:** After analyzing, it seems that the strongest fit is for **WCB (Weak Causal Basis)**.

4. **Confirmation:**
   - **D11:** Re-examine the string and confirm. The argument establishes a weak causal link based on temporal proximity without considering other potential causes for the sickness.

5. **Documentation:**
   - **D12:** The identified argument type is **Weak Causal Basis (WCB)**, because the argument assumes that drinking bottled water caused the illness solely based on the sequence of events, without sufficient evidence.

### Conclusion:
The logical fallacy used in the statement "I drank bottled water and now I am sick, so the water must have made me sick" is **Weak Causal Basis (WCB)**.
