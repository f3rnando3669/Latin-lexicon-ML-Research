For 
Let's apply the decomposition of the task <IDA> (defined as <IDAA>) to the string "My best friend says you’re a liar, so I’m not going to talk to you."

### Step-by-Step Decomposition Applied:

1. **Understand and Identify Argument Types:**
   - We are familiar with the definitions for:
     - <G> (Generalization)
     - <FE> (False Enumeration)
     - <IR> (Inappropriate Reason)
     - <RR> (Redundant Reason)
     - <WCB> (Weak Causal Basis)
     - <FU> (False Universals)
     - <DEP> (Double-Edged Phrases)

2. **Extract Propositional Content:**
   - The string can be broken down into two parts:
     - Claim: "My best friend says you’re a liar."
     - Conclusion: "I’m not going to talk to you."

3. **Check for Characteristics of Argument Types:**

   - **Generalization (<G>):** Does this involve a general claim based on a specific instance?
     - No, this string does not make a broad claim based on a specific instance.

   - **False Enumeration (<FE>):** Is this presenting a limited or inaccurate set of choices?
     - No, this string does not present an either/or scenario or limited choices.

   - **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>):** Is the reason given irrelevant or not logically supporting the conclusion?
     - Yes, the reason "My best friend says you’re a liar" is being used to support the conclusion "I’m not going to talk to you." However, one could argue that this is an inappropriate reason since the speaker is basing their decision not on their own knowledge or experience, but solely on a third-party statement without providing any substantial evidence or reason themselves.

   - **Redundant Reason (<RR>):** Does this present a reason that restates the proposition in different words?
     - No, the reason provided is not a mere restatement of the conclusion.

   - **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>):** Is there a causal claim that is not sufficiently strong to support the proposition?
     - Not necessarily, while the reason might be deemed inappropriate, it does not argue a weak causal basis.

   - **False Universals (<FU>):** Is there an appeal to universally accepted points without proof?
     - No, the string does not rely on universally accepted claims.

   - **Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>):** Are there phrases open to dual or conflicting interpretations?
     - No, the string does not utilize phrases with dual interpretations.

4. **Determine and Assign Classification:**
   - Comparing the characteristics, the string "My best friend says you’re a liar, so I’m not going to talk to you." most closely aligns with <IR> (Inappropriate Reason) as the given reason does not logically support the conclusion and is based on an unjustified third-party opinion.

5. **Finalize Classification:**
   - Therefore, the classification for the string "My best friend says you’re a liar, so I’m not going to talk to you." is <IR>.

By following the decomposed steps, we accurately classify the given string into the correct defective argument type, which is <IR>.
