Sure, let's apply the structured step-by-step approach you defined (IDAA) to classify the given text string.

### Text String <s>:
"Perhaps the most classic example of this fallacy is the argument for the existence of God. Due to the understanding of nature through science, many of the arguments that used to be used for God (or gods) were abandoned, only to be replaced with new ones, usually involving questions to which science has not definitively answered yet. The move from creationism to intelligent design is a prime example. Currently the origin of life is a popular argument for God (although a classic argument from ignorance), and an area where we very well may have a scientific answer in the next decade, at which time, the “origin of life” argument will fade away and be replaced by another, thus moving the figurative goalposts farther back as our understanding of the natural world increases. Exception: This fallacy should not be confused with an argument or set of arguments, with multiple propositions inherent in the argument. The reason for the difference between this kind of argument and the moving the goalposts fallacy, is a subtle one, but indicated by a strong initial claim (“has to be”, “must”, “required for”, etc.) that gets answered and/or what appears to be ad hoc objections that follow eventually leading to an impossible request for proof.
Fun Fact: The name “moving the goalposts” comes from the analogy of kicking a perfect field goal in American football, only to have the goalposts be moved on you. This would be very unfair.

### Step-by-Step Decomposition of <IDA>

#### Step 1: Initial Reading and Identification
- **Reading:** Carefully read the provided text to understand its content and identify the primary claim or argument being discussed.
- **Primary Claim:** The primary claim discusses a logical fallacy known as "moving the goalposts" in the context of arguments for the existence of God and how these arguments shift as scientific understanding increases.

#### Step 2: Pattern Matching for Fallacies
- **Pattern Recognition:** The text describes how new arguments replace old ones as scientific understanding progresses, implying a shifting standard of proof—this is the essence of the "moving the goalposts" fallacy.

#### Step 3: Apply Definitions
- Let's compare the description to the defined fallacies:
  - **<G> Generalization:** Not applicable, as the argument does not generalize based on limited observations.
  - **<FE> False Enumeration:** Not applicable, there's no false dichotomy or limited list of options.
  - **<IR> Inappropriate Reason:** Not applicable, the argument does not provide an irrelevant reason.
  - **<RR> Redundant Reason:** Not applicable, no redundant reasoning provided.
  - **<WCB> Weak Causal Basis:** Not applicable, no weak causal relationship presented.
  - **<FU> False Universals:** Not applicable, as it doesn't assert universal points without proof.
  - **<DEP> Double-Edged Phrases:** Not applicable, no double-edged phrases are used.

The primary argument seems to fit the description of the "moving the goalposts" fallacy, as it illustrates shifting standards of proof. However, we don't have "moving the goalposts" defined in the provided list.

#### Step 4: Rule Out Other Fallacies
- **Check Other Definitions:** Ensure the identified fallacy does not partially fit multiple categories.
  - None of the provided fallacies (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>) precisely fit the description being discussed.

#### Step 5: Final Classification
- Since the specific fallacy "moving the goalposts" isn't listed in our provided fallacies, the string does not classify into one of the listed types. It describes an argument shift when previous arguments fail without matching any of the predefined fallacies like Generalization, False Enumeration, etc.

Thus, **classification cannot be made into one of the defined types** but rather it fits the concept of "moving the goalposts," a separate fallacy not listed here.

This exercise reveals the limitations of our predefined set when encountering a detailed explanation of a fallacy not within scope.
