To classify the string "Encourages the audience to become part of a group or act because other people are acting in the same way" using the steps of <IDAA>, we need to follow the systematic breakdown we've outlined. Here are the steps:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition of IDA into IDAA:

#### Step 1: Understand the Defective Argument Types

Let's review the definitions of the defective argument types (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>):

- **Generalization (<G>):** Generalizing a broad conclusion from a specific instance.
- **False Enumeration (<FE>):** Listing fewer or more options than actually exist.
- **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>):** Providing a reason that doesn't logically support the proposition.
- **Redundant Reason (<RR>):** Repeating the proposition as a new reason in different words.
- **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>):** Offering a weak causal relationship to support the proposition.
- **False Universals (<FU>):** Asserting universally agreed points without proof.
- **Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>):** Using statements open to dual interpretations.

#### Step 2: Identify the Argument in the String <s>

String to classify: "Encourages the audience to become part of a group or act because other people are acting in the same way."

- Proposition: Encourages the audience to become part of a group or act in a certain way.
- Supporting Reason: Because other people are acting in the same way.

#### Step 3: Classify the Argument Based on Its Characteristics

**3.1** **Generalization (<G>):**
- The string does not make a broad conclusion from a single or limited set of instances.

**3.2** **False Enumeration (<FE>):**
- The string does not present an artificially limited or expanded list of options.

**3.3** **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>):**
- The string does not provide an irrelevant reason but instead appeals to popularity.

**3.4** **Redundant Reason (<RR>):**
- The string does not repeat the proposition in different words.

**3.5** **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>):**
- The string does not offer a weak causal relationship.

**3.6** **False Universals (<FU>):**
- The string encourages action based on the behavior of others, appealing to supposed universal agreement or popularity without proper justification.

**3.7** **Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>):**
- The string does not contain statements that are open to dual interpretations.

#### Step 4: Application to <s>
- The string suggests that one should act because others are doing the same, which aligns with the characteristics of False Universals (<FU>).

#### Step 5: Decision Making
- Based on the analysis, the string fits the description of a False Universal (<FU>).

#### Step 6: Documentation

- Classification: **<FU>**
- Rationale: The string encourages the audience to follow others' actions without providing a justified reason, making it a False Universal.

### Conclusion

By following these steps, we classified the string "Encourages the audience to become part of a group or act because other people are acting in the same way" as **<FU>** because it appeals to popularity as a basis for action, fitting the description of a False Universal.
