For 
Let's apply the decomposition strategy (<IDAA>) to classify the argument presented in the string "Paranormal activity is real because I have experienced what can only be described as paranormal activity."

### Step 1: Identification of Argument Type

- **Analyze**: The argument is asserting the reality of paranormal activity based on the speaker’s personal experience.
- **Nature**: This argument relies on the speaker's subjective experience to generalize a broad claim about the reality of paranormal activity.

### Step 2: Matching with Definitions

- **Generalization (<G>):**
  - **Characteristics**: Claiming a general truth based on a specific instance.
  - **Match**: Yes, the argument claims that paranormal activity is real based on the speaker’s personal experience, which is a specific instance.

- **False Enumeration (<FE>):**
  - **Characteristics**: Listing fewer or more options than actually exist.
  - **Match**: No, the argument does not enumerate options.

- **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>):**
  - **Characteristics**: Providing a reason that doesn’t logically support the proposition.
  - **Match**: The proposition that paranormal activity is real is based on a specific personal experience, which may not be a logically compelling reason but is more about overgeneralizing from specific instances.

- **Redundant Reason (<RR>):**
  - **Characteristics**: Presenting a redundant reason.
  - **Match**: No, the argument does not present a redundant statement.

- **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>):**
  - **Characteristics**: Offering a causal basis that is not compelling enough.
  - **Match**: No, this is not about causation.

- **False Universals (<FU>):**
  - **Characteristics**: Asserting universally agreed points without proof.
  - **Match**: No, the argument does not rely on universal agreement or popularity.

- **Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>):**
  - **Characteristics**: Using statements with dual interpretations.
  - **Match**: No, it is a straightforward argument without ambiguous phrases.

### Step 3: Assign Argument Type

Based on the identification and matching with definitions:
- The argument type can be best classified as **Generalization (<G>)** because it claims a general truth ("paranormal activity is real") based on a specific instance ("I have experienced what can only be described as paranormal activity").

### Step 4: Validation

- **Verification**: The argument about the reality of paranormal activity relies on a generalization from a single personal experience, which fits the characteristics of a Generalization (<G>).

Thus, the final classification of the string "Paranormal activity is real because I have experienced what can only be described as paranormal activity." is: **<G>**.
