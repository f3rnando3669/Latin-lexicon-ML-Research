For 
To classify the string "Get Verizon--1 billion people can't be wrong." as one of the defective argument types, we will follow the step-by-step decomposition provided:

### Step-by-Step Classification (<IDAA>):

#### **Step 1: Initial Analysis**
- **Primary Assertion**: The primary assertion in the string is that one should "Get Verizon."
- **Supporting Reason**: The reason provided is that "1 billion people can't be wrong."

#### **Step 2: Identify Key Features**
- The argument is suggesting that because a large number of people (1 billion) use Verizon, it must be the right choice.

#### **Step 3: Match Identified Features to Fallacies**
- **Feature**: The key feature here is the use of a universally accepted point or popular opinion (the large number of people using Verizon) to validate the claim.
- This feature matches with the definition of **<FU> (False Universals)**, which includes asserting universally agreed points without proof or appealing to popularity as a form of validation.

#### **Step 4: Classification**
- **Classify as <FU>**: Based on the identified feature and its match with the fallacy type, the string "Get Verizon--1 billion people can't be wrong." should be classified as <FU> (False Universals).

### Conclusion
Therefore, applying <IDAA> to the given string "Get Verizon--1 billion people can't be wrong.", we classify it as **<FU> (False Universals)**.
