### Step-by-Step Application of IDAA to the Argument:
"We need to fix our broken judicial system by electing new people."

1. **Identify the Argument Presented (<s>):**
   - Argument: "We need to fix our broken judicial system by electing new people."

2. **Understand the Definitions of Defective Arguments:**
   - Revisit definitions of <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, and <DEP>.

3. **Evaluate the Core Claim and Support Provided:**
   - Core Claim: We need to fix our broken judicial system.
   - Supporting Reason: By electing new people.

4. **Check for Generalization (<G>):**
   - Not applicable as it is not making a general truth based on a specific instance.

5. **Check for False Enumeration (<FE>):**
   - The argument only presents one solution (electing new people) for fixing the judicial system. There may be other solutions that are not considered, hence presenting fewer options.
   - Example Indicator: Only one solution presented without considering a broader range of possibilities.

6. **Check for Inappropriate Reason (<IR>):**
   - The reason "by electing new people" does not logically explain how it would fix the judicial system. However, it suggests a strategy which could be seen as an inappropriate or insufficient reason.
   - Example Indicator: Reason provided seems tenuously or indirectly related to the claim.

7. **Check for Redundant Reason (<RR>):**
   - Not merely restating the proposition, hence not applicable.

8. **Check for Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>):**
   - The causal link between electing new people and fixing the judicial system lacks specific detail and compelling support.
   - Example Indicator: Insufficient causal explanation provided.

9. **Check for False Universals (<FU>):**
   - Not asserting a universally accepted point.

10. **Check for Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>):**
    - The statement doesn't hinge on dual interpretations.

11. **Classify the Argument (<s>):**
    - This argument can primarily be classified as <FE> (False Enumeration) because it presents a limited option (electing new people) without considering other possible solutions. It can also be seen as having elements of <WCB> (Weak Causal Basis) due to the lack of a compelling causal link.

### Final Classification:
"We need to fix our broken judicial system by electing new people."
- This logical fallacy is primarily called <FE> (False Enumeration) and secondarily could have elements of <WCB> (Weak Causal Basis).
