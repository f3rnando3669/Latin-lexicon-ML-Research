For 
Applying the decomposition method to classify the given string \( \langle s \rangle \) "That restaurant is popular because everyone in town goes there." as a specific type of defective argument (\( \langle IDA \rangle \)), we proceed step by step as outlined:

### Step 1: Understand and Define the Task
**Task (IDA):** Classify the given string as one of the defective argument types: <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>.

### Step 2: Breakdown of Classification Criteria
We have criteria for each defective argument type:
1. **Generalization (G)**
2. **False Enumeration (FE)**
3. **Inappropriate Reason (IR)**
4. **Redundant Reason (RR)**
5. **Weak Causal Basis (WCB)**
6. **False Universals (FU)**
7. **Double-Edged Phrases (DEP)**

### Step 3: Develop a Process to Classify \( \langle s \rangle \)
1. **Identify Keywords and Phrases**
2. **Analyze Logical Structure**
3. **Check for Ambiguities**

### Step 4: Execution (i.e., Classification)
Now, apply these steps to the given string \( \langle s \rangle \):

1. **Identify Keywords and Phrases:**
   - "popular" and "everyone in town goes there".

2. **Analyze Logical Structure:**
   - Proposition: "That restaurant is popular."
   - Reason: "because everyone in town goes there."
   - We need to determine if the reason logically supports the proposition.

3. **Check for Ambiguities:**
   - The statement does not seem ambiguous or open to multiple interpretations (not <DEP>).

### Step 5: Apply Criteria to Classify

Let's check each type against \( \langle s \rangle \):

1. **Generalization (G):** 
   - The statement does not make a sweeping claim based on a specific instance.

2. **False Enumeration (FE):**
   - The statement does not list fewer or more options than actually exist.

3. **Inappropriate Reason (IR):**
   - The reason "everyone in town goes there" directly supports the claim of popularity, so it cannot be considered inappropriate.

4. **Redundant Reason (RR):**
   - The reason "everyone in town goes there" is essentially restating the claim of popularity in different words. 
   - The idea that everyone goes there is essentially a restatement of it being popular, making the reason redundant.

5. **Weak Causal Basis (WCB):**
   - The causal relationship here is not weak or unsupported; "everyone goes there" plausibly causes popularity.

6. **False Universals (FU):**
   - The statement assumes that public opinion (everyone in town) validates the restaurant's popularity, asserting a universally agreed point without proof.

7. **Double-Edged Phrases (DEP):**
   - The statement is not open to dual interpretations.

Given this breakdown, the classification that fits best is:
- **Redundant Reason (RR):** The reason given for the restaurant's popularity is essentially a restatement of the claim ('popularity' and 'everyone goes there' are mutually reinforcing but redundant ideas).

### Conclusion
"The restaurant is popular because everyone in town goes there" is best classified as an example of <RR>, Redundant Reason.
