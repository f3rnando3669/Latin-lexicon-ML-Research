For 
### <IDAA> for "Officer, I was only driving as fast as everyone around me. I'm sure I wasn't speeding."

Let’s apply the defined steps for classification:

1. **Identify the Claim and Support:**
   - **Claim:** "I wasn't speeding"
   - **Support:** "I was only driving as fast as everyone around me"

2. **Determine the Nature of the Claim:**
   - The claim involves the justification of driving behavior based on the behavior of others.

3. **Check for Logical Consistency and Relevance:**
   - Assessing if driving as fast as everyone else logically supports the claim of not speeding.
   - Consistency check: Just because others are driving at a particular speed doesn’t mean it’s not speeding according to traffic laws.

4. **Match Against Defined Defective Types:**
   - **<G> Generalization:** This is not making a broad generalization based on a specific instance.
   - **<FE> False Enumeration:** No listing of options is present here.
   - **<IR> Inappropriate Reason:** The reason "everyone around me" does not logically support the legality of the speed.
   - **<RR> Redundant Reason:** Not using redundancy in the reasoning.
   - **<WCB> Weak Causal Basis:** This is not about causal relationships.
   - **<FU> False Universals:** This argument assumes that if everyone is doing something, it must be acceptable, which resembles asserting a universally agreed point without proof.
   - **<DEP> Double-Edged Phrases:** No ambiguous interpretation leading to dual meanings.

5. **Classify the Argument:**
   - The argument assumes that because everyone else is driving at that speed, it’s implicitly acceptable behavior, which fits **<FU>** False Universals.

Thus, the argument "Officer, I was only driving as fast as everyone around me. I'm sure I wasn't speeding." is classified as **<FU>**.
