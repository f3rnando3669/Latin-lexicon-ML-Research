### Application of IDAA to the Sentence:
"When the judge asked the defendant why he hadn't paid his parking fines, he said that he shouldn't have to pay them because the sign said 'Fine for parking here' and so he naturally presumed that it would be fine to park there."

Let's go through the decomposition steps:

1. **Identify the Structure and Context of the Argument:**
   - Main claim: The defendant believes he shouldn't have to pay the parking fines.
   - Supporting reason: The sign stated "Fine for parking here," which the defendant interpreted as it being acceptable to park there.

2. **Check for Generalization (G):**
   - The argument does not make a broad general statement about a group based on limited instances.
   - No use of "all," "always," or similar terms indicating a sweeping generalization.

3. **Check for False Enumeration (FE):**
   - The argument does not present a limited set of options or exclude other possible alternatives.
   - There is no false dichotomy or constrained choices.

4. **Check for Inappropriate Reason (IR):**
   - The reason provided pertains to an interpretation of the sign, not directly supporting whether the fines should be paid.
   - But it doesn’t straightforwardly seem to fit the definition of an inappropriate reason since it’s a misunderstanding of language rather than irrelevance.

5. **Check for Redundant Reason (RR):**
   - The argument does not restate the main claim using different words.
   - It tries to provide what the defendant considers new information (misinterpretation of the sign).

6. **Check for Weak Causal Basis (WCB):**
   - This is not about a weak causal connection explaining why something happens or happened.
   - It isn't trying to establish a weak or anecdotal causality.

7. **Check for False Universals (FU):**
   - The statement isn’t making a universal claim or appeal to popularity/general belief.

8. **Check for Double-Edged Phrases (DEP):**
   - The supporting reason given by the defendant hinges on the dual interpretation of the word "Fine" on the parking sign.
   - The term "Fine" can be interpreted in two ways: as a penalty or as acceptable.
   - This ambiguity in language and its exploitation fits the notion of Double-Edged Phrases because it allows for multiple interpretations.

### Conclusion:
Based on the above analysis, the best classification of the given string is **Double-Edged Phrases (DEP)**.

This argument uses a phrase liable to dual interpretations, leveraging the ambiguity to justify the defendant’s actions.

Therefore, the classified type for the sentence
"When the judge asked the defendant why he hadn't paid his parking fines, he said that he shouldn't have to pay them because the sign said 'Fine for parking here' and so he naturally presumed that it would be fine to park there."
is <DEP>.
