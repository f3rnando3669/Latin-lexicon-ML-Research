For 
To apply the definition of <IDAA> to the string "You either support Hillary Clinton for President or you don't believe in women's rights," we will break the process down step by step:

### Step-by-Step Decomposition and Application

#### Step 1: Define the Advanced Task (<t>)
- The advanced task (<t>) here is the classification of a given string <s> into one of the specific defective argument types.

#### Step 2: Identify the Specific Steps Required for <t> (<D>)
1. **Identify the Argument Type Triggers:**
   - Look for keywords, phrases, or logic patterns that indicate the use of fallacies.
   
2. **Extract and Analyze the Core Proposition:**
   - Identify and define the main proposition and supporting statements in the given string <s>.
   
3. **Comparison with Definitions:**
   - Compare the core proposition and supporting statements with the definitions of the defective argument types <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, and <DEP>.

4. **Matching the Fallacy:**
   - Based on the comparison, determine which defective argument type the given string <s> best matches.

5. **Verify and Conclude:**
   - Ensure the identified fallacy aligns accurately with the criteria for the specific defective argument type.

#### Step 3: Apply Decomposition to <IDA> (<IDAA>)

Now let's apply <IDAA> to the provided string <s>.

**String <s>:** "You either support Hillary Clinton for President or you don't believe in women's rights."

1. **Identify the Argument Type Triggers:**
   - Look for absolute or limited choices (either...or) implying a false dichotomy.

2. **Extract and Analyze the Core Proposition:**
   - Proposition: "You either support Hillary Clinton for President."
   - Supporting Statement: "Or you don't believe in women's rights."

3. **Comparison with Definitions:**
   - Compare with <FE> (False Enumeration): This statement limits the options to only two extreme and unrelated choices, ignoring other possibilities (such as supporting other candidates while still believing in women's rights).

4. **Matching the Fallacy:**
   - The argument fits the definition of **False Enumeration (FE)**, as it inaccurately presents the situation as having only two possible outcomes — supporting Hillary Clinton or not believing in women's rights — while ignoring other valid alternatives.

5. **Verify and Conclude:**
   - Upon verification, it is clear that the statement misrepresents the scenario by omitting other reasonable choices. This accurately matches the criteria for <FE>.

**Result:** The string <s> "You either support Hillary Clinton for President or you don't believe in women's rights." is classified as <FE> (False Enumeration).

By following these methodical steps, we have accurately identified the logical fallacy for the given string using the structured approach of <IDAA>.
