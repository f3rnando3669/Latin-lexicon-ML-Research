For 
To apply <IDAA> to the string: "Speaker 1: Jesus was not really crucified.
Speaker 2: How do I know that’s true?
Speaker 1: Because the Quran says so.
Speaker 2: How do I know the Quran is correct?
Speaker 1: Because the Quran is the Word of God, and everything it says is true.
Speaker 2: How do I know that’s true?
Speaker 1: Because God tells us so, here in the Koran," we will break down the classification task step by step.

### Step-by-Step Execution

#### Step 1: Understand the Definitions
Ensure clear understanding of each defective argument type:
- **Generalization (G):** Claims a general truth based on a specific instance.
- **False Enumeration (FE):** Lists fewer or more options than actually exist.
- **Inappropriate Reason (IR):** Provides a reason that doesn't logically support the proposition.
- **Redundant Reason (RR):** Appears to be a new reason but says the same as the proposition in different words.
- **Weak Causal Basis (WCB):** Offers a causal basis that is not compelling enough to support the proposition.
- **False Universals (FU):** Asserts universally agreed points without proof.
- **Double-Edged Phrases (DEP):** Uses statements open to dual interpretations.

#### Step 2: Initial Analysis of <s>
Read the text carefully:
- "Speaker 1: Jesus was not really crucified.
- Speaker 2: How do I know that’s true?
- Speaker 1: Because the Quran says so.
- Speaker 2: How do I know the Quran is correct?
- Speaker 1: Because the Quran is the Word of God, and everything it says is true.
- Speaker 2: How do I know that’s true?
- Speaker 1: Because God tells us so, here in the Koran."

#### Step 3: Classification Criteria Matching
Match the text against each defective argument type:
- **Generalization (G):** Not applicable, there isn’t a general truth from a specific instance here.
- **False Enumeration (FE):** Not applicable, no listing of fewer or more options.
- **Inappropriate Reason (IR):** Possible match. The reason given (the Quran says so because it is the Word of God) does not provide logical support outside the assertion itself.
- **Redundant Reason (RR):** Possible match. The argument seems circular, with reasons appearing to restate the initial proposition in different words.
- **Weak Causal Basis (WCB):** Not applicable, no causal basis presented.
- **False Universals (FU):** Not applicable, as no universally agreed points are stated without proof.
- **Double-Edged Phrases (DEP):** Not applicable, no dual interpretations of statements.

#### Step 4: Elimination Strategy
Eliminate non-fitting categories:
- **G, FE, WCB, FU, DEP** do not fit the given text.

#### Step 5: Confirm the Category
- The text appears to fit both **IR** and **RR**:
  - **Inappropriate Reason (IR):** The reasoning provided (the Quran is true because the Quran says it is) does not logically support the proposition outside its own claim.
  - **Redundant Reason (RR):** The statements restate the same idea (the Quran is true because it is the Word of God, and it says so in the Quran).

#### Step 6: Assign the Classification
Based on the analysis, the more prominent defective argument type is **Redundant Reason (RR)** as it strongly portrays circular reasoning.

Hence, the string is classified as **<RR>: Redundant Reason**.

### Final Classification: **<RR>**

By following the steps of decomposition (<D>) on the defective argument type identification task (<IDA>), we have classified the given string accurately as **<RR>: Redundant Reason**.
