For 
To apply the process of <IDAA> to the statement "Three kids in one class failed the Jane Eyre quiz, I guess all the other classes will all fail it, too.", we will follow our structured approach step by step.

### Decomposition Steps for <IDA>:
#### Step 1: Understand the Definitions
Firstly, we'll recall the definitions of the defective argument types:
- **Generalization (<G>)**: Claiming a general truth based on a specific instance.
- **False Enumeration (<FE>)**: Listing fewer or more options than actually exist.
- **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>)**: Providing a reason that doesn't logically support the proposition.
- **Redundant Reason (<RR>)**: Presenting a reason that is essentially a restatement of the proposition.
- **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: Offering a causal basis that is not convincing.
- **False Universals (<FU>)**: Asserting universally agreed points without proof.
- **Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>)**: Using statements open to dual interpretations, potentially against the speaker.

#### Step 2: Analyze the Statement
Analyze the given statement to identify the main claim and any supporting points:
- Main claim: "All the other classes will fail the Jane Eyre quiz."
- Supporting point: "Three kids in one class failed the Jane Eyre quiz."

#### Step 3: Identify Keywords and Structure
Identify keywords or structures typical to the types of defective arguments:
- **<G>**: Phrases suggesting broad assumptions (e.g., "all the other classes").
- **<FE>**: No limited binary choices or complete lists presented.
- **<IR>**: The reason provided (three kids failing) appears connected to the main claim but may not be logically relevant.
- **<RR>**: The support does not merely repeat the claim in different words.
- **<WCB>**: The causal basis (three kids failing) used to predict total failure appears weak.
- **<FU>**: No claim of universal agreement or popularity.
- **<DEP>**: No dual interpretations suggested.

#### Step 4: Map the Statement to a Type
Based on identified keywords and structure:
- Match with **<G>**: The statement makes an overarching generalization that all classes will fail based on the result of three kids in one class.
- Match with **<WCB>**: The statement uses a weak causal basis (performance of three kids) to predict a widespread outcome (failure of all classes).

#### Step 5: Validate the Classification
Validate by cross-checking definitions:
- **Generalization (<G>)**: The statement, "I guess all the other classes will all fail it, too," assumes a broad outcome from a specific instance.
- **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: The sweeping prediction is based on insufficient evidence, i.e., the performance of only three students.

Primary classification: **<G>** (Generalization) because it prominently claims a general truth based on a specific instance.
Secondary possible classification: **<WCB>** (Weak Causal Basis) because the evidence provided is not compelling enough to support the claim.

### Final Classification
The statement "Three kids in one class failed the Jane Eyre quiz, I guess all the other classes will all fail it, too." is primarily classified as **<G>** (Generalization).

Thus, applying <IDAA> to the statement classifies it as **<G>**.
