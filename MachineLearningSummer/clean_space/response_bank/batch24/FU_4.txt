For 
Sure, let's systematically apply the steps of IDAA to classify the given string "Everyone else is doing it, so should you."

### Step-by-Step Application (IDAA):

1. **Input Collection**:
   - **Step**: Obtain the argument string \( <s> \).
   - **Example**:  \( <s> = "Everyone else is doing it, so should you" \)

2. **Preprocessing**:
   - **Step**: Break down the structure of the argument. Identify premises and the conclusion.
   - **Example Analysis**: The argument suggests a course of action based on what everyone else is supposedly doing.
     - Premise: Everyone else is engaged in a certain action.
     - Conclusion: Therefore, you should engage in the same action.

3. **Type Comparison**:
   - **Step**: Compare the analyzed argument to each defective argument type characteristics.
     - **<G>**: Does this argument make a sweeping generalization based on a specific instance? No, it's not generalizing from specific instances.
     - **<FE>**: Does this argument list fewer or more options than actually exist? No, it does not enumerate options.
     - **<IR>**: Does this argument provide a reason that doesn't logically support the proposition? No, it's not about irrelevant reasoning.
     - **<RR>**: Is this argument presenting a redundant reason? No, it does not redundantly restate the proposition.
     - **<WCB>**: Does this argument offer a weak causal basis? No, causation is not being claimed.
     - **<FU>**: Does this argument assert universally agreed points without proof? Yes, it appeals to the idea that because "everyone else" is doing something, it must be the correct course of action, relying on an unproven universal agreement.
     - **<DEP>**: Does this argument use double-edged phrases? No, there's no dual interpretation that undermines the speaker.

4. **Classification Decision**:
   - **Step**: Based on the comparison, decide on the most fitting defective argument type.
   - **Example Decision**: The argument "Everyone else is doing it, so should you" matches the characteristics of **<FU> (False Universals)**, as it appeals to a universal behavior without proof to support the conclusion.

5. **Output**:
   - **Step**: Return the classified defective argument type.
   - **Example Output**: **<FU>**

### Summary:
By following the detailed decomposition steps in IDAA, we systematically classified the argument string \( <s> = "Everyone else is doing it, so should you" \) as **<FU>** (False Universals).
