For 
Let's apply <IDAA> to the string "You need to go to the party with me, otherwise you’ll just be bored at home."

1. **Analyze the given string**:
   - This is a statement presenting two options related to attending a party.

2. **Identify logical elements**:
   - It offers a choice between going to the party with the speaker or supposedly being bored at home.

3. **Compare with known defective types (fallacies)**:
   - **<G>: Generalization** - No, the string does not generalize from a specific instance.
   - **<FE>: False Enumeration** - Yes, it lists only two options whereas there may be more.
   - **<IR>: Inappropriate Reason** - No, the reasoning is focused more on limited options.
   - **<RR>: Redundant Reason** - No, it doesn't repeat the same thing in different words.
   - **<WCB>: Weak Causal Basis** - No, it's not a weak causal relationship.
   - **<FU>: False Universals** - No, it doesn’t claim a universally accepted point.
   - **<DEP>: Double-Edged Phrases** - No, it's not open to dual interpretations.

4. **Map the string to a specific defective argument type**:
   - The fallacy present is <FE>: False Enumeration since it restricts the choice to only two options without considering other possibilities (e.g., engaging in other activities at home).

5. **Validate the identification**:
   - The identification as False Enumeration is logically consistent because the argument restricts the choice to attending the party or being bored at home, without providing other possible options.

**Conclusion**:
By following these steps, the string "You need to go to the party with me, otherwise you’ll just be bored at home." is identified as having the defective argument type <FE> (False Enumeration).
