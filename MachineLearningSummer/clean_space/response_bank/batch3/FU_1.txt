### Application of IDAA to "Everyone should like coffee: 95% of teachers do!"

We'll follow the steps of decomposition for identifying the defective argument (IDAA) as defined above:

#### Steps for Decomposition (D)

1. **Understand the Argument in the String (s)**
2. **Identify Keywords or Phrases that Indicate the Type of Defective Argument**
3. **Compare the Characteristics of the Argument with Definitions of Defective Argument Types**
4. **Match the Argument to One of the Predefined Defective Argument Types (G, FE, IR, RR, WCB, FU, DEP)**
5. **Provide a Rationale for the Identified Type**

#### Step-by-Step Analysis

**Step 1: Understand the Argument**
- The statement is: "Everyone should like coffee: 95% of teachers do!"
- The core argument is suggesting that everyone should like coffee because a specific group (95% of teachers) likes coffee.

**Step 2: Identify Keywords or Phrases**
- The key phrase here is "95% of teachers do". This appeals to a majority within a specific group.

**Step 3: Compare with Definitions**
- Looking at the definitions, this argument appears to use the approval of a majority within a certain group to make a general statement about what "everyone" should do.

**Step 4: Match Argument Type**
- This characteristic fits the **False Universals (FU)** type because it is using the majority opinion within a specific group (teachers) to generalize what everyone should do.

**Step 5: Provide Rationale**
- The statement "Everyone should like coffee" is supported by the fact that "95% of teachers do". This is an appeal to popularity within a subgroup, lacking broader substantiation. It implies a universal recommendation based on specific, limited evidence.

Therefore, applying IDAA to the given string:

"Everyone should like coffee: 95% of teachers do!" is identified as `<FU>` because it asserts a universal recommendation without sufficient evidence, relying on the popularity of coffee within a specific group (teachers).
