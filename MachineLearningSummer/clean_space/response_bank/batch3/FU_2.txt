For 
Let's apply the process of identifying a defective argument (<IDA>) to the phrase: 

"Ninety percent of all people surveyed said that McDonald's is better than Burger King so it must be true."

### Decomposition of <IDA> (Applying <D> to <IDA>):

1. **Understand the string (`<s>`)**: Carefully read and understand the given statement.
   - Statement: "Ninety percent of all people surveyed said that McDonald's is better than Burger King so it must be true."

2. **Identify the Structure**: Break down the argument into premises and conclusions.
   - Premise: "Ninety percent of all people surveyed said that McDonald's is better than Burger King."
   - Conclusion: "McDonald's is better than Burger King."

3. **Compare with Defective Argument Types**: Reference the definitions of defective argument types such as <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>.

4. **Match Characteristics**: Check which characteristics of the argument match the specific defective argument types.
    - **For <G>**: Not applicable, as the statement is not generalizing from a specific instance.
    - **For <FE>**: Not applicable, as the argument is not reducing the number of actual options.
    - **For <IR>**: Not applicable, as the reasoning relates to people's opinions but isn't completely irrelevant.
    - **For <RR>**: Not applicable, as the conclusion isn't just a restatement of the premise.
    - **For <WCB>**: Not applicable, as the argument isn't citing a weak cause-effect relationship.
    - **For <FU>**: Potentially applicable, as the argument applies a universally agreed point (the majority opinion) to assert truth.
    - **For <DEP>**: Not applicable, as the statement is not open to dual interpretations.

5. **Assign the Defective Type**: The type that fits the analysis best is:
    - **False Universals (<FU>)**: The statement asserts that because a majority of surveyed people believe something to be true, it inherently is true. This appeals to popularity or the fact that many people think something as a form of validation without providing objective evidence.

6. **Validate**: Double-check if the identified defect logically fits the given argument.
   - Yes, it fits because the argument is relying on the majority opinion to validate the truth of a subjective statement ("McDonald's is better than Burger King").

### Conclusion
The phrase "Ninety percent of all people surveyed said that McDonald's is better than Burger King so it must be true." represents the fallacy of **False Universals (<FU>)**.
