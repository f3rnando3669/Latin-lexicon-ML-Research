For 
To apply the task of identifying the defective argument type (<IDA>) to the given statement, we will decompose the task into specific steps (<D>) and apply them.

### String (s):
"It is warmer this year in Las Vegas as compared to last year; therefore, global warming is rapidly accelerating."

### Applying IDAA:

1. **Identify the Core Proposition**:
    - The main claim or statement being made is: "Global warming is rapidly accelerating."

2. **Evaluate the Supporting Reason**:
    - The reason given to support the claim is: "It is warmer this year in Las Vegas as compared to last year."

3. **Classify the Reason Relative to the Claim**:
    - The reason provided is based on a specific instance (the temperature in Las Vegas this year compared to last year) to make a general claim about the global phenomenon of global warming.

4. **Match with Definitions**:
    - The argument generalizes from a specific instance (the weather in one specific location over one specific period) to make a broad, global claim. This fits the definition of **Generalization (<G>)**.

Therefore, the identified defective argument type for the string <s> is **Generalization (G)**.
