For 
Let's apply the IDAA process to the given statement: "Don't listen to Mr. Fingers when he says walk in the hallways. How can you trust someone who wears bow ties?"

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (D) for Identifying the Defective Argument

**Step 1: Understanding the Argument**
- **Proposition:** Don't listen to Mr. Fingers when he says walk in the hallways.
- **Supporting Reason:** How can you trust someone who wears bow ties?

**Step 2: List Possible Defective Argument Types**
- <G> (Generalization)
- <FE> (False Enumeration)
- <IR> (Inappropriate Reason)
- <RR> (Redundant Reason)
- <WCB> (Weak Causal Basis)
- <FU> (False Universals)
- <DEP> (Double-Edged Phrases)

**Step 3: Match Characteristics**
- **Examine the Reason Provided:**
  - The reason provided ("someone who wears bow ties") doesn't logically support the proposition ("Don't listen to Mr. Fingers when he says walk in the hallways").

**Step 4: Narrow Down Options**
- **Eliminating unlikely types:**
  - It’s not a **<G> (Generalization)** because it’s not making a broad claim based on a specific instance of bow tie wearers being untrustworthy in general.
  - It’s not a **<FE> (False Enumeration)** because it does not involve a limited set of choices.
  - It’s not a **<RR> (Redundant Reason)** because the reason isn’t just a restatement of the proposition in different words.
  - It’s not a **<WCB> (Weak Causal Basis)** as it’s not making a weak causation claim.
  - It’s not a **<FU> (False Universals)** since it doesn’t involve an appeal to universals or popularity.
  - It’s not a **<DEP> (Double-Edged Phrases)** because there's no dual interpretation involved.

- The reason provided about bow ties doesn’t directly relate to the rationale for walking in the hallways, making the support logically irrelevant.

**Step 5: Validate Choice**
- The reason provided ("How can you trust someone who wears bow ties?") does not logically support the decision to dismiss Mr. Fingers' advice about walking in hallways.

### Conclusion
The defective argument type of the given string is:

**<IR> (Inappropriate Reason)**
