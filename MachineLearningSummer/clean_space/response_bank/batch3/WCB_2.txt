To apply the structured process (<IDAA>) to the given statement, we'll follow the decomposition steps outlined earlier:

### Given String:
"Since Anna Camacho became vice president of the parent-teacher association, student performance has declined and teacher morale is down. We on the school board believe that Camacho bears sole responsibility for the downtrend."

### Decomposition and Identification Process (<IDAA>):

1. **Understand the Argument:**
   - **Claim:** Anna Camacho is solely responsible for the decline in student performance and teacher morale since she became vice president of the parent-teacher association.
   - **Supporting Statements:** Student performance has declined and teacher morale is down since Camacho's tenure began.

2. **Categorization:**
   - **Examine the argument** to determine if it fits one of the defective argument types.
   - Possible indicators include attributing sole responsibility based on correlation (which may imply causation).

3. **Matching Argument Characteristics to Types:**
   - Determine if the argument **claims a general truth from a specific instance** (possibly <G>).
     - Not quite, as the argument isn't generalizing a specific detail to an entire class.
   - Check if the argument **lists options incompletely or excessively** (possibly <FE>).
     - No, this argument doesn't list any options.
   - Assess if the reason provided **doesn’t logically support the proposition** (possibly <IR>).
     - There is some relevance, but not an inappropriate reason exactly.
   - Identify if the reason **repeats the proposition in different words** (possibly <RR>).
     - No, the reasoning is distinct from the conclusion.
   - Evaluate if the argument **provides a reason not robust enough to support the claim** (possibly <WCB>).
     - Yes, it attributes the sole cause of decline without sufficiently strong evidence to support this causation. The presence of decline since her tenure does not necessarily mean she caused it.
   - Recognize if the argument **asserts universally accepted points without proof** (possibly <FU>).
     - Not applicable; the argument doesn’t assert a universal truth.
   - Determine if the statement **can be interpreted in dual ways** (possibly <DEP>).
     - No, it’s straightforward in its accusation.

4. **Identification of Defective Argument Type (<IDA>):**
   - Based on the characteristics matched, this argument type fits best with **Weak Causal Basis (WCB)**. The argument offers an association between Camacho's position and the decline in performance/morale but does not provide compelling evidence of causation.

### Conclusion:
The defective argument type for the given string is **Weak Causal Basis (WCB)**.
