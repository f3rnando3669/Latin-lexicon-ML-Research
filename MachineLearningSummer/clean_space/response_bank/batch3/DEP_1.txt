For 
To apply the IDAA process to the statement "<If I tell my teacher I have done my homework, but I have only done part of it, I am using>", we will go through the steps as outlined:

1. **Understanding the Definitions**:
    - **Generalization (<G>)**: Making a broad statement based on limited instances.
    - **False Enumeration (<FE>)**: Presenting an incorrect number of choices.
    - **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>)**: Providing reasoning that doesn't logically support the proposition.
    - **Redundant Reason (<RR>)**: Rephrasing the proposition instead of providing new support.
    - **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: Poorly supporting a cause-effect relationship.
    - **False Universals (<FU>)**: Asserting universally accepted points without proof.
    - **Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>)**: Statements open to dual interpretations that could backfire on the speaker.

2. **Identifying Clues in the Argument**:
    - The statement suggests a scenario where the speaker tells the teacher they have done their homework when they have only done part of it.
    - This indicates a potential for releasing a misleading or dual interpretation of the truth.

3. **Matching Clues to Types**:
    - Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>): This type of defect involves statements open to dual interpretations that could backfire on the speaker. Here, the speaker is saying they've done their homework, which can be interpreted literally as having completed all of it, but in context, it can also mean they've only done part of it. This duality opens the possibility of misinterpretation and potential consequences if the teacher finds out the truth.

Thus, the defective argument type of the given string "<If I tell my teacher I have done my homework, but I have only done part of it, I am using>" is **Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>)**.
