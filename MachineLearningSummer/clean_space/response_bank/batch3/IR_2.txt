For 
Certainly! Let's apply the steps of decomposition (<D>) to the task of identifying the defective argument type (<IDA>) for the statement: 

"We cannot listen to John’s opinion on global warming because he is a tree hugger."

### Step-by-Step Decomposition (<D>)

1. **Identify the claim and the reason**:
   - **Claim**: "We cannot listen to John’s opinion on global warming."
   - **Reason**: "because he is a tree hugger."

2. **Check the type of reasoning**:
   - **Generalization (<G>)**: Does the reason use a specific instance to make a broad claim?
   - **False Enumeration (<FE>)**: Does it list fewer or more options than really exist?
   - **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>)**: Does it provide a reason that logically supports the proposition?
   - **Redundant Reason (<RR>)**: Does it state the same thing as the proposition in different words?
   - **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>)**: Does it offer a reason that is strong enough to support the proposition?
   - **False Universals (<FU>)**: Does it assert universally agreed points without proof?
   - **Double-Edged Phrases (<DEP>)**: Does it use statements open to dual interpretations?

3. **Determine the corresponding defective argument type**:

### Application to the String <s>

1. **Claim**: "We cannot listen to John’s opinion on global warming."
   **Reason**: "because he is a tree hugger."
   
2. **Analysis**:
   - The reason "because he is a tree hugger" does not provide logical support for the claim about ignoring an opinion on global warming.
   - The term "tree hugger" is a derogatory label and may not logically connect with the validity of John's opinion on global warming.

3. **Conclusion**: 

The argument seems to discredit John’s opinion based on a personal characteristic (“tree hugger”) which is an example of an **ad hominem** fallacy. However, given our predefined categories, the closest fit is **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>)** because the reasoning provided does not logically support the proposition.

### Final Answer:
The defective argument type is **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>)**.
