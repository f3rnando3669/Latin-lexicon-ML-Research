To apply the structured task of <IDAA> (Applying Task Decomposition to Identifying Argument Type) to the statement "Every time I go to sleep the sun goes down. Therefore, my sleeping causes the sun to set," let's break this down into specific steps:

### Step 1: Read and Understand the Given String <s>
Read the string carefully to understand its content:
"Every time I go to sleep the sun goes down. Therefore, my sleeping causes the sun to set."

### Step 2: Identify Keywords or Phrases That Hint at a Type of Defective Argument
Identify any keywords or phrases that suggest a logical flaw:
- "Every time I go to sleep the sun goes down."
- "Therefore, my sleeping causes the sun to set."

### Step 3: Cross-Reference Identified Keywords with Known Definitions of Defective Argument Types
We cross-reference these identified keywords and the logical structure of the statement with the defined defective argument types:
- The argument appears to draw a causal conclusion based on coincidental correlation ("Every time I go to sleep the sun goes down" leading to "my sleeping causes the sun to set").
- We need to determine if this fits into any of our predefined categories (<G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, <DEP>).

Given the options:
- **Generalization (<G>):** Based on a specific instance to claim a general truth, not quite fitting here.
- **False Enumeration (<FE>):** Lists fewer or more options than exist, not applicable.
- **Inappropriate Reason (<IR>):** Provides an irrelevant reason, partially applicable but not directly.
- **Redundant Reason (<RR>):** Paraphrases itself, not applicable.
- **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>):** Provides an unconvincing causal link.

### Step 4: Determine the Type of Defective Argument <s> Represents and Classify It Accordingly
Based on the analysis, the statement incorrectly asserts causality by drawing a conclusion from a correlation without compelling evidence.
- The reason for the argument ("my sleeping causes the sun to set") is based on a weak causal link ("Every time I go to sleep the sun goes down").

Therefore, the statement "Every time I go to sleep the sun goes down. Therefore, my sleeping causes the sun to set" represents a **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>)** defective argument type.

### Conclusion
By following <IDAA>, we determined that the defective argument type for the given statement is:
- **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>)**
