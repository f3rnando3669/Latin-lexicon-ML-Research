For 
Let's apply the structured process of identifying the defective argument type (\<IDAA\>) to the given string:

### Given String (\<s\>)
"Every time I go to sleep the sun goes down. Therefore, my sleeping causes the sun to set."

### Decomposition (\<D\>)

#### Step 1: Understand and Identify
- **Read \<s\> carefully**:
  - "Every time I go to sleep the sun goes down. Therefore, my sleeping causes the sun to set."

#### Step 2: Identify the Proposition or Main Statement
- **Identify the main statement**:
  - The main statement is "my sleeping causes the sun to set," which is the conclusion derived from the first statement.

#### Step 3: Classify Argument Type
- **Determine if the argument corresponds to any predefined defective argument types. Let's analyze each type:**

  - **\<G\>**: Does it make a generalization based on a specific instance?
    - No, it doesn't generalize about a group based on specific observations about the group.

  - **\<FE\>**: Does it list fewer or more options than exist?
    - No, it doesn't suggest limited options.

  - **\<IR\>**: Does it provide a reason that doesn't logically support the proposition?
    - Yes, the relationship between going to sleep and the sun setting is not logically supported. There’s a confusion between correlation and causation.

  - **\<RR\>**: Does it restate the proposition in other words?
    - No, it doesn't just rephrase the proposition.

  - **\<WCB\>**: Does it offer a reason that is not compelling enough to support the proposition?
    - It might fit here, given that the reasoning (sleep causing sunset) is not compelling, yet this doesn’t fully capture the nature of the confusion.

  - **\<FU\>**: Does it assert universally agreed points without proof?
    - No, it doesn’t rely on universally agreed propositions.

  - **\<DEP\>**: Does it use statements open to dual interpretations?
    - No, it’s quite clear in its erroneous logic rather than ambiguous.

#### Step 4: Compare and Analyze
- Considering the above analysis, the argument is most closely related to **\<IR\>**:
  - The reason (going to sleep) doesn't logically support the proposition (causes the sun to set). It represents a defective reasoning where correlation is mistaken for causation.

#### Step 5: Match the Argument
- The characteristics of the argument in \<s\> match with **\<IR\>** (Irrelevant Reason).

#### Step 6: Conclude
- The defective argument type in the given string (\<s\>) "Every time I go to sleep the sun goes down. Therefore, my sleeping causes the sun to set." is **\<IR\>**.

**Conclusion**: The argument in \<s\> is of type **\<IR\>** (Irrelevant Reason).
