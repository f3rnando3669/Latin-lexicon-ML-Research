To classify the given interaction step by step, we need to understand each label and how the dialogue fits into each category:

- **<G>**: General statement or argument.
- **<FE>**: Factual error.
- **<IR>**: Irrelevant response.
- **<RR>**: Rhetorical response.
- **<WCB>**: Weak counter-argument or rebuttal.
- **<FU>**: Follow-up.
- **<DEP>**: Derogatory or personal attack.

Let's break down the dialogue:

1. **J: "Cats are better than dogs."**
   - This is a general statement or argument (label: **<G>**).

2. **V: "Dogs are better."**
   - This is a counter-argument (label: **<WCB>**, because it is a simple assertion without evidence).

3. **J: "You are a lazy person. You won't even be able to take care of a dog."**
   - This is a derogatory attack that targets the character of V rather than addressing the argument about cats and dogs (label: **<DEP>**).

Thus, the classification of the entire interaction is as follows:
- **J: Cats are better than dogs.** <G>
- **V: Dogs are better.** <WCB>
- **J: You are a lazy person. You won't even be able to take care of a dog.** <DEP>
