For 
To classify the sentence "It’s getting late, and we still have to decide on the school budget. What do you say we just leave it as is and we can call it a night?" into one of the given types <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Identify the types:**
   - <G>: General Statement
   - <FE>: Feasibility Statement
   - <IR>: Irrelevance Claim
   - <RR>: Redundancy Claim
   - <WCB>: Work Completeness Belief
   - <FU>: Further Understanding
   - <DEP>: Dependency Relation

2. **Analyze the sentence:**

   - "It’s getting late, and we still have to decide on the school budget."
     - This part of the sentence states the current situation.

   - "What do you say we just leave it as is and we can call it a night?"
     - This part suggests a course of action due to the situation stated earlier.

3. **Classify the first part:**
   - "It’s getting late, and we still have to decide on the school budget."
     - This piece acknowledges an existing situation. It doesn't claim or infer, it's just giving context. It could be considered as setting the stage for the next action and isn't standalone to fit into any specific category without the following suggestion.

4. **Classify the second part:**
   - "What do you say we just leave it as is and we can call it a night?"
     - This is a suggestion based on the earlier context. It addresses the concept of ending the discussion/decision-making and implies that the work is sufficient as it is, given the circumstances (lateness of the time).

5. **Relate it to the given types:**
   - The suggestion to "just leave it as is" implies a belief that the work done so far is sufficient. It suggests completing or stopping work at its current stage which aligns with "Work Completeness Belief" (<WCB>).

6. **Double-check for fitting:**
   - Is there an aspect of this sentence that suggests dependency (<DEP>), irrelevance (<IR>), redundancy (<RR>), feasibility (<FE>), general statement (<G>), or further understanding (<FU>)? Not prominently.
   - The sentence heavily leans towards a belief that the work to decide the school budget has reached a point where it is adequate to stop (“call it a night”).

So, the classification step by step indicates the sentence fits best under <WCB> (Work Completeness Belief). 

**Final Classification: <WCB>.**
