For 
Sure, let's break down the statement "You must obey the law, because it's illegal to break the law." and classify the logical fallacy step by step based on the categories provided:

1. **<G>** - Generalization fallacy:
   - This involves making broad generalizations from a limited set of facts or situations. The statement in question doesn't make a broad generalization.

2. **<FE>** - False equivalence:
   - This occurs when someone incorrectly claims that two situations or things are equivalent in value, relevance, or importance. The statement doesnâ€™t involve a false equivalence; it asserts a direct relationship.

3. **<IR>** - Irrelevant reason (Non sequitur):
   - This occurs when a conclusion does not logically follow from the premises. The statement is tautological rather than unrelated; it stays strictly within its defined terms.

4. **<RR>** - Red herring:
   - This is a diversionary tactic designed to mislead or distract from the relevant issue. The statement does not divert from its central assertion about obeying the law.

5. **<WCB>** - Weak correlation (Post hoc):
   - This fallacy falsely infers causation from a correlation. The statement under consideration does not involve correlation or causation.

6. **<FU>** - Faulty use of authority:
   - This involves relying on an authority that is not truly knowledgeable or credible on the issue at hand. The statement does not appeal to any authority figures.

7. **<DEP>** - Circular reasoning (Begging the Question):
   - This happens when the argument's conclusion is used as a premise without proper justification. The statement "You must obey the law, because it's illegal to break the law" is an example of circular reasoning. The statement's conclusion (you must obey the law) presupposes the truth of its premise (it's illegal to break the law), resulting in no new information or justification.

Given this analysis, the logical fallacy used in the statement is best classified as:

**<DEP> - Circular reasoning (Begging the Question)**
