For 
To classify the given statement "Giving 10% of your income to the Church will free a child’s soul from Limbo into Heaven, so give your money!" into one of the categories <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Identify the categories:**
   - <G>: Genuine
   - <FE>: False Equivalence
   - <IR>: Irrelevant Reason
   - <RR>: Reductio ad Ridiculum
   - <WCB>: Wishful Claiming Based
   - <FU>: Fallacy of Unwarranted Assumption
   - <DEP>: Dependent on other unproven claims

2. **Analyze the content and claims in the statement:**

   - The statement claims that donating 10% of your income will result in freeing a child's soul from Limbo into Heaven.
   - This claim presumes the existence of Limbo, the process of freeing a soul, and a direct effect from a financial contribution (10% of income).

3. **Assess the reasoning and assumptions:**
   - The statement involves specific theological beliefs: existence of Limbo, ability to free a soul, and correlation with the act of giving money.
   - These beliefs are not universally accepted and lack empirical evidence. They rely on a particular religious framework.
   
4. **Determine the nature of the assumptions and reasoning:**
   - The claim depends on specific religious doctrines, which a person may not accept unless they already share those beliefs.
   - The causal link (monetary donation leading to a soul's transition from Limbo to Heaven) lacks proof and is based on religious authority rather than empirical evidence.

5. **Classify based on type:**
   - The strongest fit appears to be <DEP> (Dependent on other unproven claims). This classification fits because the statement is heavily reliant on specific, unproven theological assumptions. These assumptions are fundamental to making the final claim actionable or acceptable.

Therefore, the statement "Giving 10% of your income to the Church will free a child’s soul from Limbo into Heaven, so give your money!" is classified as <DEP> (Dependent on other unproven claims).
