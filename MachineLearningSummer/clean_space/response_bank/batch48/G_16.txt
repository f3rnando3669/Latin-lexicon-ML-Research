Certainly! To classify the statement "My first day of basketball practice was easy, so it will always be easy," we can analyze it step-by-step according to the categories provided:

1. **Check the Meaning**: The statement makes an inference based on one instance. 

2. **Identify the Type**:
    - **Generalization (G)**: Generalizes a conclusion based on a single instance or limited evidence.
    - **False Exclusion (FE)**: Improperly excludes certain possibilities.
    - **Incomplete Reasoning (IR)**: Based on incomplete information.
    - **Repeated Reasoning (RR)**: Repeats similar reasoning.
    - **Weak Comparison/Bad analogy (WCB)**: Uses a poor comparison.
    - **False Cause (FU)**: Assumes a causal relationship without sufficient evidence.
    - **Depersonalization/Distraction (DEP)**: Distracts from the original person or subject.

**Initial Analysis**:
- The conclusion "so it will always be easy" is drawn from the premise that "my first day of basketball practice was easy."
- This presents a clear overgeneralization because it takes a single event and extends its outcome indefinitely into the future.

**Verification Against Category**:
- **Generalization (G)**: The statement definitely generalizes one instance of ease to all future practices.
- **False Exclusion (FE)**: No evidence that it's excluding other possibilities.
- **Incomplete Reasoning (IR)**: It's more than just incomplete; it's an overreach.
- **Repeated Reasoning (RR)**: No repeated reasoning found.
- **Weak Comparison/Bad analogy (WCB)**: No analogy made here.
- **False Cause (FU)**: Not assuming causality, just extending a trend.
- **Depersonalization/Distraction (DEP)**: No distraction element present.

**Final Classification**:
- The statement is an example of **Generalization (G)** because it extrapolates a conclusion about all future practices based on a single event.

Therefore, the classification type for the statement "My first day of basketball practice was easy, so it will always be easy." is **<G>**.
