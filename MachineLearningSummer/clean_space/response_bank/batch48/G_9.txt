To classify the argument and reasoning in the given text, we can break it down step-by-step and identify the relevant components.

**Text:**
"If you accept that the story of Adam and Eve was figurative, then you will do the same for most of the Old Testament stories of similar literary styles. Once you are there, the New Testament and the story of Jesus does not make sense, which will lead you to believe that the resurrection of Jesus was a “spiritual” one. Once you accept that, you won’t be a Christian anymore; you will be a dirty atheist, then you will have no morals and start having sex with animals of a barnyard nature. So you better take the story of Adam and Eve literally, before the phrase, “that chicken looks delicious”, takes on a whole new meaning."

1. **Guilt by Association (G)**
   - The argument implies that accepting a figurative interpretation of the Adam and Eve story will lead to becoming an atheist, which it equates with having no morals and engaging in bestiality. This is an attempt to make any figurative interpretation look bad by associating it with extreme consequences.

2. **Faulty Evidence (FE)**
   - The suggestion that accepting a figurative interpretation of Adam and Eve will automatically lead to atheism and immoral behavior is not based on sound logical evidence. It assumes a direct path of beliefs leading to extreme behaviors without valid evidence.

3. **Irrelevant Reason (IR)**
   - There's a jump in reasoning to assume that interpreting a story as figurative undermines all religious belief, leading to loss of morality and extreme actions—that reasoning is irrelevant to whether the story of Adam and Eve itself should be taken literally.

4. **Reductio ad Absurdum (RR)**
   - The text seems to use the strategy of illustrating absurd or extreme results (having sex with animals) to argue against a position (non-literal interpretation of a biblical story).

5. **Weak Cause and Effect (WCB)**
   - The causal link proposed (accepting figurative interpretation leading to atheism, and then to immoral actions like bestiality) is very weak and serves as a scare tactic rather than a valid cause-effect relationship.

6. **Fear (or Frightening) Appeal (FU)**
   - The text is trying to instill fear of moral degradation and extreme behavior (sex with animals) to persuade the reader to accept the literal interpretation of the Adam and Eve story.

7. **Desperation (DEP)**
   - Attempting to scare the reader into accepting a literal interpretation could be seen as an act of desperation to prevent theological shift and maintain specific belief systems.

Given these observations, the text primarily employs:

- **Fear (or Frightening) Appeal (FU)**: This is the most evident strategy, aiming to scare the reader away from a figurative interpretation.
  
- **Reductio ad Absurdum (RR)**: By suggesting extremely absurd outcomes (bestiality), it tries to reject the figurative interpretation by making it seem ridiculous.

So, the classifications <FU> and <RR> appear to be the most applicable.
