Sure, let's break it down step by step to classify the given text correctly. The given categories are:
- <G>: Grievance
- <FE>: Feedback
- <IR>: Inquiry
- <RR>: Request/Recommendation
- <WCB>: Work-Related Complaint
- <FU>: Follow-Up
- <DEP>: Deviation from Expected Procedure

Let’s analyze the provided text:

1. **Content Analysis**: 
   The text describes a situation where the wife wants to discuss cleaning out the garage. The husband deflects by asking about patio furniture, which leads the wife to focus on shopping for new patio furniture instead of discussing the garage.

2. **Identify Subject Matter**:
   - The wife’s initial topic: Cleaning out the garage.
   - The husband's reaction: Asked about patio furniture, leading to wife shopping for new patio furniture.

3. **Observing the Interaction**:
   - The husband diverts from the original topic (cleaning the garage) by introducing a new topic (patio furniture).

4. **Checking for Characteristics**:
   - **Grievance (G)**: There is no complaint expressed.
   - **Feedback (FE)**: This isn’t feedback; rather, it's a diversion.
   - **Inquiry (IR)**: It includes a question, but it’s more of a diversion tactic.
   - **Request/Recommendation (RR)**: There isn't a request or recommendation; just a question asked to divert.
   - **Work-Related Complaint (WCB)**: Does not apply; this is not work-related.
   - **Follow-Up (FU)**: It’s not a follow-up on a previous conversation; it introduces a new topic.
   - **Deviation from Expected Procedure (DEP)**: The husband’s behavior represents a deviation from the expected procedure, which would be to stay on topic regarding cleaning the garage.

5. **Final Classification**:
   Considering all the observations, the husband's action represents a **Deviation from Expected Procedure (DEP)** because he changes the topic from the garage to patio furniture to avoid the initial discussion.

Hence, the classification for the provided text is **<DEP>**.
