Sure! Let's carefully evaluate the statement to classify it according to the given types: <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>.

1. **Understanding the statement:**
   - "My neighbor told me that the position of the sun, moon, and stars decide our personalities."
   - "I believe her because she is a famous violin player."

2. **Break down the reasoning:**
   - The claim: The positions of celestial bodies decide our personalities.
   - The support: Belief in the claim is based on the neighbor being a famous violin player.

3. **Analyzing the reasoning:**
    - **G - Generalization**: This occurs when a conclusion is drawn about a whole group based on a sample. This doesn't fit our case.
    - **FE - False Equivalence**: This fallacy happens when two unlike things are compared as if they are alike because they share some characteristic. This doesn't seem to fit our case.
    - **IR - Irrelevant Reason**: This can be a match if the reason given is irrelevant to the claim. Here, the reason for believing in astrology (because someone is a famous violin player) is indeed irrelevant to the validity of the claim.
    - **RR - Red Herring**: This is a distraction that diverts attention from the original issue. The statement does not introduce an unrelated issue to divert attention.
    - **WCB - Weak or Contested Belief**: Refers to a belief that's not widely accepted or is debatable. Astrology can be seen as this, but the reasoning given still needs evaluation.
    - **FU - False Understanding**: This happens when there's a misunderstanding or misinterpretation of a fact or concept. It doesn't quite fit here.
    - **DEP - Dependence on Inadequate Authority**: This is relevant if the authority lacks expertise in the subject matter. Here, the authority (famous violin player) lacks expertise in astrology.

4. **Conclusion:**
    - The reasoning for believing the claim (the neighbor being a famous violin player) is neither relevant nor adequate to the subject matter (astrology).

Therefore, the statement is best classified as:

**<DEP> - Dependence on Inadequate Authority**

This is because the neighbor's fame as a violin player does not make her an authority in astrology.
