To classify the statement "Grace and Helen were both romantically interested in Brad. One day, with Brad sitting within earshot, Grace asked in an inquisitive tone whether Helen was still having problems with her drug habit." correctly, we should first understand what each abbreviation stands for. 

Here's a quick guide to the abbreviations:
- **G**: Gossip
- **FE**: Factually Explanatory
- **IR**: Irrelevant
- **RR**: Romantic Revelation
- **WCB**: Well-Calculated Betrayal
- **FU**: Failed Understanding
- **DEP**: Drama-Ensuring Provocation

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Context Analysis**:
   - Grace and Helen are both interested in Brad romantically.
   - Grace makes a statement within Brad's earshot regarding Helen having problems with a drug habit.

2. **Statement Implications**:
   - Grace's question to Helen about her drug habit is designed to cast Helen in a negative light in front of Brad.
   - This question seems to be strategic, aiming to influence Brad's perception of Helen.

3. **Determining the Intent**:
   - There’s clear intent by Grace to cause harm to Helen's reputation within an important context (Brad's presence).

4. **Assessing for Drama**:
   - Grace’s action is provocative and could lead to a confrontation or a revelation that creates drama between all parties involved.

5. **Checking for Betrayal**:
   - If Grace and Helen were friends or even neutral towards each other, mentioning something personal in front of someone they are both interested in could be seen as betrayal.

6. **Final Classification**:
   - The situation isn’t mere gossip (**G**) because it’s loaded with intent specific to their romantic interest.
   - It’s not purely factually explanatory (**FE**) due to the contextual nuance.
   - It’s relevant (**IR**) to the dynamics between the characters.
   - It does involve a romantic component but reveals a habit rather than just romantic feelings (**RR**).
   - It indicates a calculated move to harm Helen's standing (**WCB**).
   - There isn’t a lack of understanding (**FU**) by Grace about what her statement implies.
   - It ensures a level of drama due to the personal nature of the remark and its setting (**DEP**).

After weighing all these factors, it appears the statement most closely aligns with **DEP** (Drama-Ensuring Provocation), as the primary effect of Grace’s question is to provoke a dramatic fallout within the romantic triangle by revealing sensitive information in a tactless manner. Thus, the correct classification would be:

**DEP**
