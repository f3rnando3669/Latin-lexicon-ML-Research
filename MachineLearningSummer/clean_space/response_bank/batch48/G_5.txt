For 
To classify the statement "You can tell that guy's Mexican - he's wearing a sombrero" using the types provided, we will analyze it step by step:

1. **<G> (Generalization):**
   - A statement that makes a broad generalization about a group or an individual often based on limited information.
   - The statement assumes that wearing a sombrero is indicative of being Mexican, which is a type of generalization.

2. **<FE> (Fabrication/Error):**
   - A statement that includes false information or an error of fact.
   - This doesn't necessarily fit as an outright fabrication or error since some Mexicans do wear sombreros, but the implication is more general than factual.

3. **<IR> (Irrelevant):**
   - A statement that offers information not relevant to the context.
   - The context is about identifying someone's nationality based on their attire, so it doesn't seem irrelevant.

4. **<RR> (Redefinition/Reinterpretation):**
   - A statement that redefines or reinterprets a concept or idea.
   - This statement does not redefine or reinterpret anything, but makes an assertion based on an observation.

5. **<WCB> (Without Clear Basis):**
   - A statement made without a clear or logical basis.
   - The connection between wearing a sombrero and being Mexican is a stereotype and lacks a strong logical basis, but some might argue it has a cultural basis.

6. **<FU> (Unsupported):**
   - A statement that lacks support or evidence for its claim.
   - The statement is unsupported because it generalizes from a specific cultural symbol to the entirety of the Mexican nationality without evidence.

7. **<DEP> (Deprecation):**
   - A statement that belittles or demeans someone or something.
   - The statement itself does not appear to demean or belittle but propagates a stereotype.

Given this analysis, the most appropriate classification for the statement "You can tell that guy's Mexican - he's wearing a sombrero" would be:

- **<G> (Generalization)**: The statement makes a broad generalization about Mexican people based on the sight of a sombrero.

Additionally, it also fits into:
- **<FU> (Unsupported)**: Since the claim about identifying nationality based solely on attire like a sombrero lacks proper support or evidence.

However, **<G> (Generalization)** is the most direct and clear classification for this statement.
