For 
To classify the statement using the provided categories, let's break down each type and match the statement step by step.

1. **<G>: Generalization** - This involves making a broad conclusion based on a small sample.

2. **<FE>: Faulty Evidence** - This includes using evidence that is unreliable or irrelevant to draw a conclusion.

3. **<IR>: Irrelevancy** - This involves introducing information that is not relevant to the argument.

4. **<RR>: Relevance, Reasonable** - This involves reasoning that is relevant and reasonable.

5. **<WCB>: Weakening the Case Against the Bias** - This includes information that weakens the original stance against a bias.

6. **<FU>: Failure to Understand** - This refers to a failure in understanding the subject or argument.

7. **<DEP>: Deception** - This involves intentional deception or misleading information.

Letâ€™s analyze the statement:

- "An environmental group illegally blocked loggers and workers at a nuclear plant." - This is a specific event involving a specific environmental group engaging in illegal activity.
  
- "Therefore, environmentalists are radicals who take the law into their own hands." - This is a general conclusion drawn about all environmentalists based on the action of one group.

### Analysis:

1. **<G>: Generalization**
   - The statement generalizes the behavior of all environmentalists based on the actions of one group. This fits the criteria for a generalization as it takes a specific incident as representative of a larger group.

2. **<FE>: Faulty Evidence**
   - The evidence used (actions of one group) is not representative of all environmentalists. This could be considered faulty evidence because it doesn't logically support the sweeping conclusion.

3. **<IR>: Irrelevancy**
   - The information about the action of one specific group might be seen as only partially relevant to the overall claim about all environmentalists.

4. **<RR>: Relevance, Reasonable**
   - The reasoning isn't reasonable or relevant for the broad conclusion made.

5. **<WCB>: Weakening the Case Against the Bias**
   - This doesn't apply here since the statement isn't about weakening a case but making an illogical generalization.

6. **<FU>: Failure to Understand**
   - There could be an element of misunderstanding the diversity within environmentalist groups, but it's more about the logical error in generalizing.

7. **<DEP>: Deception**
   - This doesn't appear to be an intentional deception but rather a logical fallacy.

### Conclusion:

The primary issue with the statement is the broad generalization it makes about all environmentalists based on the actions of one group. Therefore, the statement is best classified as **<G>: Generalization**.
