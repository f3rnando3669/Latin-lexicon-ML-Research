For 
To classify the statement "Only a mentally ill person would kill someone, so anyone who kills someone is automatically mentally ill," let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. **Type Identification:**
    - **Understanding the abbreviations:**
        - **<G>: Generalization** - making a broad statement that applies to many cases.
        - **<FE>: False Equivalence** - incorrectly equating two different things.
        - **<IR>: Irrelevant Reasoning** - providing a reason that does not actually support the conclusion.
        - **<RR>: Reductio ad Absurdum** - extending an argument to absurd lengths to discredit it.
        - **<WCB>: Weak Causal Basis** - incorrectly identifying a causal connection.
        - **<FU>: Faulty Use of an Argument** - misusing a particular type of argument.
        - **<DEP>: Dependent Premises** - making a conclusion based on premises that are interdependent.
    
2. **Analyzing the Statement:**
    - "Only a mentally ill person would kill someone" is a generalization.
    - "so anyone who kills someone is automatically mentally ill" is a direct inference drawn from the initial generalization.
  
3. **Assessment of Logic:**
    - The initial part ("Only a mentally ill person would kill someone") is a **Generalization** about the behavior of mentally ill individuals.
    - The conclusion ("so anyone who kills someone is automatically mentally ill") is derived directly from that generalization, assuming there are no exceptions.
  
4. **Classify Based on Analysis:**
    - The statement makes a sweeping generalization about mental illness and killing.
    - It simplifies complex human behavior and mental health issues into an overly broad and unfounded assertion.

Given this analysis, the statement can be classified primarily as a **<G> Generalization**. This is because the core issue is the broad categorization without acknowledging the variability and multitude of factors involved in both mental illness and acts of killing.
