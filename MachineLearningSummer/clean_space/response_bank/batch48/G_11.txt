For 
To classify the given statement, we'll analyze it step by step through the given classifications: Generalization (<G>), Faulty Evidence (<FE>), Irrelevant Reason (<IR>), Repetitious Reasoning (<RR>), Whole-Cluster Bias (<WCB>), Faulty Use of Principle (<FU>), and Dependence on a False Hypothesis (<DEP>).

### **Step-by-Step Analysis**

1. **Statement Analysis**:
   - **Premise 1:** "Some students who attend tutoring over the summer are not very intelligent."
   - **Premise 2:** "Beth attended summer tutoring."
   - **Conclusion:** "Beth is not a very good student."

2. **Classifications**:
    - **Generalization (<G>)**: This involves making a broad statement based on a limited sample. The first premise suggests a generalization about students who attend tutoring.
    - **Faulty Evidence (<FE>)**: This classification applies if the evidence provided is unreliable or insufficient to support the conclusion.
    - **Irrelevant Reason (<IR>)**: This occurs if the reasoning provided is unrelated to the conclusion.
    - **Repetitious Reasoning (<RR>)**: This is characterized by repeating the same point in different ways without providing new evidence.
    - **Whole-Cluster Bias (<WCB>)**: Involves attributing characteristics of a part to the whole group without justification.
    - **Faulty Use of Principle (<FU>)**: This applies when a principle is misused or applied incorrectly.
    - **Dependence on a False Hypothesis (<DEP>)**: This applies when the conclusion depends on a hypothesis that is not true.

3. **Identifying the Correct Classification**:
    - The argument concludes that Beth is "not a very good student" due to attending summer tutoring, which is an assumption based on a general statement ("Some students who attend tutoring... are not very intelligent").
    - The conclusion is unsupported because even though some students who attend tutoring might not be intelligent, it doesn't lead to the conclusion that Beth isn't a very good student. This doesn't logically follow from the premises and shows a misapplication of the initial group characteristic to an individual without sufficient evidence.

### **Conclusion:**

- The argument is primarily invalid due to a **faulty use of principle** since it wrongly applies the general observation about some students attending summer tutoring to Beth specifically without adequate justification. This makes it a case of **Faulty Use of Principle (<FU>)**.

Therefore, the classification of the statement "Some students who attend tutoring over the summer are not very intelligent. Since Beth attended summer tutoring, she is not a very good student." is **Faulty Use of Principle (<FU>)**.
