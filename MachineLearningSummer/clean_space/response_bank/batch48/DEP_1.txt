For 
To classify the statement "I didn’t steal your pen—I borrowed it" into one of the provided categories <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>, we need to understand what these categories represent. However, since there isn't a provided key for these abbreviations, I'll make reasonable assumptions based on common interpretations.

1. <G> typically stands for General statement or claim.
2. <FE> usually signifies Factual Explanation.
3. <IR> often refers to an Irrelevant Remark.
4. <RR> could be a Rebuttal.
5. <WCB> might mean Weakly Corroborated Belief.
6. <FU> could be Follow-Up.
7. <DEP> might mean Defensive Elaborated Point.

Let's analyze the statement:

"I didn’t steal your pen—I borrowed it."

- The speaker is responding to an implicit or explicit accusation of theft.
- The statement refutes the notion of theft by presenting an alternative explanation (borrowing instead of stealing).

Step-by-step analysis:

1. Determine if it's a general statement (<G>): It doesn't broadly apply; it's specific to an incident.
2. Check for factual explanation (<FE>): It provides an explanation, but might not strictly be a "factual" clarification.
3. Assess if it’s irrelevant or not (<IR>): It directly addresses the accusation, so it’s not irrelevant.
4. Consider if it functions as a rebuttal (<RR>): The statement directly counters the accusation of theft.
5. Evaluate if it's a weakly corroborated belief (<WCB>): The statement does not reflect a weakly corroborated belief.
6. Determine if it is a follow-up (<FU>): It can be part of a dialogue but stands strong on its own.
7. See if it's a defensive elaborated point (<DEP>): It seems to serve as a defense, but without much elaboration.

Conclusion: The statement "I didn’t steal your pen—I borrowed it" best fits the category of <RR> (Rebuttal), as it directly counters the accusation with an alternative explanation.
