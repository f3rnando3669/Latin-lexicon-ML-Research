For 
Let's classify this passage step by step based on the provided categories: <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, and <DEP>.

1. **Identify the Argument**:
   - Sally presents a compelling case for a more equitable taxation system.
   - Sam responds by attacking Sally's personal characteristics rather than addressing her argument.

2. **Determine the Nature of the Argument**:
   - Sam's response does not provide any counter-argument or evidence against Sally's point on taxation.
   - Instead, Sam attacks Sally's marital status, past arrest, and personal odor.

3. **Match with Fallacy Types**:

   - **<G> (Ad Hominem or Personal Attack)**: Sam attacks Sally's character rather than addressing her argument. This seems to fit.

   - **<FE> (Faulty Evidence)**: This does not apply since Sam does not present any evidence, faulty or otherwise, relevant to the argument.

   - **<IR> (Irrelevant Information)**: The information Sam presents is irrelevant to the discussion on taxation but does not capture the personal attack nature clearly.

   - **<RR> (Red Herring)**: While Sam's statements distract from the main issue, this category might be too general for targeting personal characteristics specifically.

   - **<WCB> (Weak Causal or Correlation-Based Argument)**: This does not apply; Sam is not making a causal argument based on weak correlation.

   - **<FU> (Faulty Use of Authority)**: This does not apply since no authority or misuse thereof is involved in Sam's argument.

   - **<DEP> (Discussion of Emotion or Prejudice)**: Prejudice might be involved, but this doesn't directly address why the personal attack method is used.

Based on the analysis:

- The personal attack on Sally's character rather than her argument fits best under **<G> (Ad Hominem or Personal Attack)**.

**Conclusion**: The passage is best classified as **<G>**.
