For 
Let's break down the argument and then classify the fallacy step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Claim:** 
    The main claim here is that the politician wants you to think he loves America.

2. **Supporting Evidence Provided:** 
    The evidence provided is that his last rally had 20 American flags flying behind him.

3. **Analyze the Evidence in Relation to the Claim:**
    The argument is attempting to use the presence of American flags at the rally as evidence that the politician is trying to convey his love for America.

4. **Determine the Relevance and Validity:**
    The display of American flags does not necessarily mean the politician loves America or is trying to convey such a love genuinely. The presence of flags is not a direct proof of patriotism or of the politician's intentions. This relies on a symbolic association rather than a substantive argument.

Considering these aspects, the argument can be classified as an example of a **False Equivalence (FE)** fallacy, where two distinct things are equated based on a flawed or superficial similarity.

**Final Classification: FE**

The fallacy in this argument is that it falsely equates the display of American flags (a symbol) with a genuine characteristic or intention (love for America).
