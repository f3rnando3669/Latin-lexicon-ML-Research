For 
To classify the statement "Yes, we have safety issues in our factory. But we work really hard to make a good product." into one of the specified types: <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the components of the statement:**
   - Admission of a problem: "Yes, we have safety issues in our factory."
   - Balancing the negative with a positive: "But we work really hard to make a good product."

2. **Understand the meaning of each type:**

   - **<G>**: (General) A general statement without specific or significant detail about a particular aspect.
   - **<FE>**: (Factual Explanation) A straightforward explanation that provides specific facts.
   - **<IR>**: (Irrelevant) Information that does not relate to the main point or topic at hand.
   - **<RR>**: (Reassurance) A statement aimed at alleviating concerns or complaints.
   - **<WCB>**: (Willingness to Change/Blame) An acknowledgment of a problem with an implication or indication of a willingness to address or change it.
   - **<FU>**: (Follow-Up) Information or action that follows a previous statement or concern.
   - **<DEP>**: (Deflection/Pivot) Shifting the focus from a negative aspect to something else, often positive.

3. **Analyze the statement:**
   - The first part, "Yes, we have safety issues in our factory," is an admission of a negative situation.
   - The second part, "But we work really hard to make a good product," provides a positive counterpoint to balance or mitigate the negative aspect.

4. **Determine the intent behind the statement:**

   The statement seems to acknowledge a problem (safety issues) but immediately shifts to a positive aspect (hard work resulting in a good product). This could be seen as a way to reassure others despite the problem or to deflect concern by highlighting a positive attribute.

5. **Classify the statement:**

   Based on the analysis:
   - It admits a negative aspect (safety issues), which could be construed as part of <WCB> (acknowledgment).
   - However, it counters this negativity with a positive note (work hard to make a good product), which fits the idea of deflecting or pivoting from the problem.

Therefore, the most appropriate classification here seems to be:

**<DEP> (Deflection/Pivot)**

Because the statement pivots from acknowledging a negative issue to emphasizing a positive characteristic of the factory's output.
