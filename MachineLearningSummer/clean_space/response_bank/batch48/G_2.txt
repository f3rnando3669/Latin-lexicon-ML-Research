For 
To classify the statement "The more things change, the more they remain the same," we need to analyze it and match it to the most appropriate category out of <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, and <DEP>. Let's consider these categories step by step.

1. **<G> (Generalization)**: This type applies if the statement broadly discusses a general truth or trend across instances.
   - "The more things change, the more they remain the same" does express a general principle that despite changes, underlying constants might persist. This fits well with a generalization.

2. **<FE> (False Equivalence)**: This type applies if the statement incorrectly assumes two things are equal.
   - The statement doesn't make a direct comparison suggesting false equivalence between two distinct entities.

3. **<IR> (Irrelevant)**: This type applies if the statement is beside the point or not useful in the current context.
   - The statement appears relevant and meaningful with regard to discussing change and constancy, so it's not irrelevant.

4. **<RR> (Redundant or Repetitive)**: This type applies if the statement unnecessarily repeats the same idea.
   - While the statement mentions change and constancy, it does so in a way that draws a meaningful paradox or contradiction, rather than being redundant.

5. **<WCB> (Weak Causal Basis)**: This type applies if the statement implies causation without a strong basis.
   - The statement isn’t directly positing a causal relationship but rather observing a paradoxical outcome, so <WCB> doesn’t fit.

6. **<FU> (Factual Untruth)**: This type applies if the statement is factually incorrect.
   - The statement is more of a reflective observation or aphorism rather than a factual claim, so <FU> doesn't fit here.

7. **<DEP> (Dependency)**: This type applies if the statement's truth depends on another claim.
   - The statement stands on its own as a proverbial observation rather than depending on another statement’s truth.

By the process of elimination and following the analysis, the best fitting category is <G> (Generalization), as the statement makes a broad statement that can be interpreted as a universal principle about the nature of change and constancy.

Therefore, the statement "The more things change, the more they remain the same." is of type **<G> (Generalization)**.
