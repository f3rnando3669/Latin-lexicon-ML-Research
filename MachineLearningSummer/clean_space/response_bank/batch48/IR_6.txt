For 
To classify the argument "Richard Dawkins, an evolutionary biologist and perhaps the foremost expert in the field, says that evolution is true. Therefore, it's true." correctly, let's analyze it step by step:

1. **Identify the Key Elements of the Argument:**
    - **Claim:** Evolution is true.
    - **Supporting Evidence:** Richard Dawkins, an expert in evolutionary biology, says it is true.

2. **Understand the Type of Reasoning Used:**
    - The argument appeals to the authority of Richard Dawkins, who is an expert in evolutionary biology.

3. **Analyze for Type Classification:**
    - **<G> (Generalization):** This argument does not make a generalized conclusion from a specific set of instances.
    - **<FE> (False Analogy):** This argument is not relying on an analogy, false or otherwise.
    - **<IR> (Irrelevant Reason):** The argument relies on the credibility of an authority rather than relevance to a different subject.
    - **<RR> (Red Herring):** The argument does not divert attention away from the topic at hand.
    - **<WCB> (Weak Comparison):** This argument does not involve a comparison.
    - **<FU> (Faulty Use of Authority):** This might be applicable since the sole reason provided for the claim's truth is the authority of a single expert.
    - **<DEP> (Dependence on Uncertain Evidence):** The argument is not based on probabilistic or uncertain evidence but relies on authoritative endorsement.

4. **Determine the Final Classification:**
    - The argument primarily hinges on the authority of a figure in the field to assert a truth claim. This suggests a potential defect in reasoning known as an appeal to authority, specifically a "faulty use of authority" if the sole reason an assertion is true is because an expert says so. Experts can be wrong, and other evidence should ideally support the claim's veracity.

Therefore, the type that best classifies this argument is:

**<FU> - Faulty Use of Authority.**
