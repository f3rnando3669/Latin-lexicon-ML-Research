Sure, let's break down the given statement to classify it according to the types provided. The types given are:

- <G>: Generalization
- <FE>: False Equivalence
- <IR>: Irrelevant
- <RR>: Red Herring
- <WCB>: Weak Causal Basis
- <FU>: Faulty Use of Evidence
- <DEP>: Dependence on the claim being false

The statement we need to classify is: "You moved the goalposts or made up an exception when your claim was shown to be false."

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Generalization (<G>):**
   - Generalizations apply a broad statement to specific cases without sufficient evidence. This statement does not seem to involve making broad claims without underlying evidence.

2. **False Equivalence (<FE>):**
   - False Equivalence occurs when it is falsely stated that two situations are equivalent. This doesn't apply here since the statement is about changing criteria or creating exceptions rather than comparing two things.

3. **Irrelevant (<IR>):**
   - Irrelevance applies when a point is brought up that does not directly relate to the argument or discussion. This statement directly relates to the argument and addresses the tactics used in maintaining a claim.

4. **Red Herring (<RR>):**
   - A Red Herring diverts attention to another issue. The statement points out a specific logical tactic (moving the goalposts) and does not divert attention elsewhere. Thus, it is not a red herring.

5. **Weak Causal Basis (<WCB>):**
   - This applies when a cause is not directly supported by adequate evidence. Our statement does not talk about a causation or lack thereof.

6. **Faulty Use of Evidence (<FU>):**
   - Faulty Use of Evidence refers to misuse or misrepresentation of evidence. Here, the statement doesn't directly misuse evidence but rather comments on the shifting of argument criteria.

7. **Dependence on the claim being false (<DEP>):**
   - This type seems relevant as the statement explicitly mentions that the tactic (moving the goalposts or making up an exception) was used when the original claim was shown to be false. It suggests that the validity of the statement depends on the initial claim being disproven.

### Conclusion:
Given the breakdown, the best classification for "You moved the goalposts or made up an exception when your claim was shown to be false." is <DEP> because it highlights a tactic used in response to the original claim being shown as false, thus depending on the falsehood of the original claim.
