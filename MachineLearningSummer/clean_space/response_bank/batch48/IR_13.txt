For 
To classify the statement "Is your stupidity inborn?" into one of the types <G> (greeting), <FE> (farewell), <IR> (information request), <RR> (request/recommendation), <WCB> (wish/consideration/belief), <FU> (future action/plan), or <DEP> (denial/excuse/plea), we can take the following steps:

1. **Identify the Nature of the Statement:**
   - The statement is posed as a question.
   - It appears to ask for information or suggests an inquiry into someone's inherent qualities.

2. **Analyze the Context:**
   - The question is phrased in a way that could be interpreted as offensive or insulting.
   - The term "stupidity" is derogatory, which implies that the question could have an underlying hostile intent.

3. **Eliminate Inapplicable Categories:**
   - **<G> (greeting):** Not a greeting.
   - **<FE> (farewell):** Not a farewell.
   - **<RR> (request/recommendation):** Not making a request or recommendation.
   - **<WCB> (wish/consideration/belief):** Not expressing a wish, consideration, or belief.
   - **<FU> (future action/plan):** Not referring to a future action or plan.
   - **<DEP> (denial/excuse/plea):** Not presenting a denial, excuse, or plea.

4. **Consider the Remaining Category:**
   - **<IR> (information request):** The statement is phrased as a question asking about the inborn nature of "stupidity."

5. **Determine Suitability for the Category:**
   - Even though the phrasing is offensive, the structure aligns with an information request category since it seeks a form of response/information.

Thus, despite its inflammatory nature, the classification that best fits "Is your stupidity inborn?" is:

**<IR> (information request)**
