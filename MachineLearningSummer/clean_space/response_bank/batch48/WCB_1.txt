For 
To classify the statement "President Jones raised taxes, and then the rate of violent crime went up. Jones is responsible for the rise in crime." according to the types provided, let's evaluate it step-by-step:

1. **Identify Potential Fallacies or Issues**:
   - The statement assumes a causal relationship between raising taxes and the rise in violent crime.
   - It suggests that the cause of the rise in crime is Jones’ action of raising taxes.

2. **Check for Post Hoc Ergo Propter Hoc Fallacy**:
   - This is a logical fallacy that assumes that if one event happens after another, then the first must be the cause of the second. The structure "A happened, then B happened; therefore, A caused B" fits this pattern.
   - Here, "President Jones raised taxes" (Event A) is followed by "the rate of violent crime went up" (Event B), leading to the conclusion that "Jones is responsible for the rise in crime."

3. **Evaluate the Given Types**:
   - **<G>**: Generalization
     - The statement does not make a broad generalization from specific cases.
   - **<FE>**: False Equivalence
     - The statement doesn’t equate two unrelated things as being the same.
   - **<IR>**: Irrelevant Reason
     - It could be argued that the reason given (raising taxes) is not relevant to the outcome (rise in crime), but the main issue seems to be causation rather than relevance alone.
   - **<RR>**: Red Herring
     - The argument does not appear to distract from the issue at hand by bringing up a different issue.
   - **<WCB>**: Weak Causal Claim 
     - This is a possibility since the statement claims causation without providing strong supporting evidence.
   - **<FU>**: Faulty Use of Authority 
     - The statement does not use any authority inappropriately.
   - **<DEP>**: Dependent Argument 
     - The argument doesn't depend on another argument made elsewhere.

4. **Determine the Best Classification**:
   - The primary issue is that the statement assumes causation from a mere correlation (taxes raised followed by a rise in crime). This fits the pattern of a Weak Causal Claim.

Thus, the classification for the statement "President Jones raised taxes, and then the rate of violent crime went up. Jones is responsible for the rise in crime." is **<WCB>** (Weak Causal Claim).
