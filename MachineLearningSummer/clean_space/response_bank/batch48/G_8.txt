For 
Let's break down the given statement step by step to classify it into one of the provided types: <G> (Generalization), <FE> (False Equivalence), <IR> (Irrelevance), <RR> (Reverse Reasoning), <WCB> (Wrong Cause and Effect), <FU> (Faulty Use of Statistics), or <DEP> (Definition Problem).

Statement: "While jogging around the neighborhood, you are more likely to get bitten by someoneâ€™s pet dog, than by any member of the canine species."

1. **Understanding the Statement**:
- The statement compares the likelihood of getting bitten by a pet dog versus any member of the canine species while jogging in a neighborhood.

2. **Checking for Generalization (<G>)**:
- A generalization would involve making a broad statement based on limited evidence. The statement does not generalize; it specifies a particular context (jogging around the neighborhood).

3. **Checking for False Equivalence (<FE>)**:
- False equivalence involves incorrectly equating two things that are not actually equal. The statement does not directly equate two things in an incorrect manner.

4. **Checking for Irrelevance (<IR>)**:
- Irrelevance means the information included does not relate logically to the point being made. The statement's comparison of pet dogs to the broader category of canines is relevant to the discussion of likely bite scenarios.

5. **Checking for Reverse Reasoning (<RR>)**:
- Reverse reasoning involves starting with a conclusion and working backward to assume the premises. This does not apply here, as the statement does not exhibit backward logic.

6. **Checking for Wrong Cause and Effect (<WCB>)**:
- Wrong cause and effect presupposes a causal relationship that is incorrect. The statement does not claim causal relationships but rather compares probabilities.

7. **Checking for Faulty Use of Statistics (<FU>)**:
- Faulty use of statistics would involve presenting statistical information incorrectly or misleadingly. The statement might imply a statistical comparison, but no actual data or numbers are provided or misused.

8. **Checking for Definition Problem (<DEP>)**:
- Definition problem involves ambiguities or issues relating to the definition of terms. Here, there may be an issue: the statement contrasts a pet dog with "any member of the canine species." However, a pet dog is indeed a member of the canine species, making the comparison problematic from a definitional standpoint.

**Classification**: Based on the analysis, the statement is best classified as <DEP> (Definition Problem) because it sets up a comparison that is inherently flawed due to the overlapping categories (pet dog is a subset of the canine species).
