For 
To classify the given statement, "Be happy with the 1972 Chevy Nova you drive. There are many people in this country who don’t even have a car," we first need to understand the definitions of each possible type:

1. **<G> (Generalization)**: Broad statements that apply to many instances or people without specifics.
2. **<FE> (False Equivalence)**: Comparing two things as if they are equivalent when they are not.
3. **<IR> (Irrelevance)**: Information or comments that are not relevant to the main topic.
4. **<RR> (Red Herring)**: Distracting from the main issue with an unrelated topic.
5. **<WCB> (Wrong Cause/Effect)**: Incorrectly identifying the cause of an outcome.
6. **<FU> (Faulty Use of Authority)**: Citing sources or authorities incorrectly or without merit.
7. **<DEP> (Depersonalization)**: Showing lack of empathy or understanding, treating the subject impersonally.

Let's classify the statement step-by-step:

1. **Consider the meaning and intent of the sentences:**
   - The first part, "Be happy with the 1972 Chevy Nova you drive," suggests a call for contentment with one's possessions.
   - The second part, "There are many people in this country who don’t even have a car," provides a reason for the suggested contentment by comparing it to the situation of others.

2. **Identify if the statement involves broad generalizations:**
   - The statement does generalize about the population ("many people in this country who don’t even have a car"). However, this is used to make a point rather than forming the main argument.

3. **Examine if it's a false equivalence:**
   - It’s comparing the situation of having a 1972 Chevy Nova with not having a car at all. This isn’t an equivalence but rather a comparative context highlighting different levels of material possession.

4. **Assess relevance:**
   - The comparison is relevant to the advice given in the first sentence. It supports why one should be content with their car.

5. **Check for red herring:**
   - There’s no attempt to distract from an issue; instead, it’s strengthening the main idea.

6. **Evaluate for wrong cause/effect:**
   - The statement is not about causation, but about comparative contentment.

7. **Review for faulty use of authority:**
   - There’s no appeal to authority in this statement.

8. **Assess depersonalization:**
   - The statement does not depersonalize; rather, it acknowledges the specific struggle of not having a car and asks the listener to recognize their relative privilege.

After this step-by-step evaluation, the statement appears to primarily fit with a generalization used to support a call for contentment. Thus, the most fitting classification is:

**<G> (Generalization)**
