For 
To classify the statement "Ghosts exist... because I saw a ghost in my closet," let's break it down and analyze it step by step to identify the logical fallacy.

Here are the types of logical fallacies abbreviated in the options:

1. **<G>**: Generalization - making broad claims based on a small sample size.
2. **<FE>**: False Equivalence - equating two things that are not actually equivalent.
3. **<IR>**: Irrelevance - introducing information that is not pertinent to the argument.
4. **<RR>**: Red Herring - diverting attention to a different issue to distract from the main argument.
5. **<WCB>**: Weak Causal Basis - concluding that one thing causes another with insufficient evidence.
6. **<FU>**: False Uniqueness - believing oneself or one's experience to be unique when it is not.
7. **<DEP>**: Dependence on Unverified Premise - relying on a premise that has not been substantiated.

Given the phrase "Ghosts exist... because I saw a ghost in my closet," we can identify the key elements:

- The argument claims that "ghosts exist."
- The reason provided for this claim is a personal anecdote: "because I saw a ghost in my closet."

The logical fallacy here involves drawing a broad conclusion (the existence of ghosts) based on a single anecdotal experience. The argument is assuming that one personal experience is enough to prove a general truth which falls under:

- **<G> (Generalization)**: This fallacy is characterized by making broad claims based on an insufficient amount of evidence. 

So, the statement can be classified as:

- **<G> (Generalization)**.
