Sure, let's break down the statement step by step to classify it correctly.

The statement is: "Your Honor, the defendant has been able to provide no strong evidence to prove his innocence; therefore, you must find him guilty."

1. **Identify the types and their definitions:**
   - <G>: Generalization
   - <FE>: False Evidence
   - <IR>: Irrelevance
   - <RR>: Red Herring
   - <WCB>: Weak Cause and Effect
   - <FU>: Faulty Use of Authority
   - <DEP>: Dependence on Emotional Appeal

2. **Analyze each part of the statement:**
   
   - "Your Honor, the defendant has been able to provide no strong evidence to prove his innocence;"
     - This part implies that the burden of proof is on the defendant to prove innocence, which is not a correct legal standard. Normally, the prosecution must prove the defendant's guilt.
   
   - "therefore, you must find him guilty."
     - This conclusion is drawn from the absence of strong evidence from the defendant. It implies a direct cause and effect without considering the prosecution's role in proving guilt.

3. **Determine if there are any clear logical fallacies or errors:**

   - There is a potential misplacement of the burden of proof. The legal principle is "innocent until proven guilty," not the other way around.
   - The conclusion is drawn from the premise without addressing whether the prosecution has provided sufficient evidence to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.

4. **Match the identified issues to the provided categories:**
   - The statement's logical flaw could be categorized as a weak cause and effect since it concludes guilt based solely on the defendant's lack of evidence rather than the prosecution's proof of guilt.

Therefore, based on the detailed analysis, the statement "Your Honor, the defendant has been able to provide no strong evidence to prove his innocence; therefore, you must find him guilty." most accurately fits the category:

**<WCB> - Weak Cause and Effect**
