For 
Certainly! Let's break down and classify the argument:

1. **Identify key statements:**
   - Premise: "The United States is the wealthiest nation in the world."
   - Conclusion: "So every American is wealthy."

2. **Analyze the logical structure and check for validity:**
   - The argument assumes that because the United States, as a nation, is wealthy, every individual within that nation must also be wealthy.
   - This reasoning is flawed because the wealth of a nation does not imply that all individual citizens share equally in that wealth. Wealth distribution within a country can vary significantly.

3. **Classify the type of error or flaw:**
   - The argument makes a generalization based on the status of the entire country and improperly applies it to every individual within that country.

4. **Classification based on common logical fallacies:**
   - This type of error is often referred to as a "Composition Fallacy," where one assumes that what is true for the whole is true for the parts.

Given the types specified <G> (Generalization), <FE> (False Equivalence), <IR> (Irrelevant Conclusion), <RR> (Red Herring), <WCB> (Weak Connection Between), <FU> (Faulty Use of Statistics), and <DEP> (Depends on Detail):

   - **<G> (Generalization):** The argument is making a faulty generalization by assuming that the wealth status of the nation applies to all individual Americans.

Therefore, this argument should be classified as **<G> (Generalization)**.
