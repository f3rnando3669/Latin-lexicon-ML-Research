Sure, let's break down the classification process step by step.

### Step 1: Understand the Definitions
Before classifying the statement, let's understand what each type stands for:
- **<G>**: General statement or claim that is often a personal opinion.
- **<FE>**: Factual Evidence - verifiable data or information that supports a claim.
- **<IR>**: Interpretation - making sense of factual data or events.
- **<RR>**: Reasoned Argument - logical arguments or reasoning process behind a claim.
- **<WCB>**: Well-Constructed Argument - a clearly presented and structured argument.
- **<FU>**: Fallback Position - retreat to a secondary claim or stance when the original is challenged.
- **<DEP>**: Dependent Clause - a supportive statement that cannot stand alone but supports a main clause.

### Step 2: Analyze the Statement
The statement provided is:
"Trump cites (biased) poll results showing that people think he’s a strong leader to prove a point that he is a strong leader.

ABC News/Washington Post Poll (wrong big on election) said almost all stand by their vote on me & 53% said strong leader."

#### Parsing the Text:
1. **"Trump cites (biased) poll results showing that people think he’s a strong leader to prove a point that he is a strong leader."**
   - This sentence explains what Trump is doing: citing poll results to prove he is a strong leader. It implies there might be bias in the poll results.
   
2. **"ABC News/Washington Post Poll (wrong big on election) said almost all stand by their vote on me & 53% said strong leader."**
   - This is a direct statement of the poll result statistics: almost all stand by their vote, and 53% said Trump is a strong leader. It also critiques the poll by noting it was "wrong big on election."

### Step 3: Classification
  
1. **First Sentence Breakdown**:
   - It generally describes an action (citing biased poll results) and makes a claim (to prove he’s a strong leader).
   - This is more of a **<G>** (General statement) because it introduces the overall claim without providing specific supportive evidence within this part.

2. **Second Sentence Breakdown**:
   - This provides specific numbers and results from a named poll.
   - It also includes an interpretation (“wrong big on election”) which critiques the source.
   - The factual numbers presented (“almost all stand by their vote on me & 53% said strong leader”) form **<FE>** (Factual Evidence).

### Conclusion
Combining the parts:

- The first sentence: <G> (General statement).
- The second sentence: <FE> (Factual Evidence), with a touch of interpretation.

Therefore, if you had to assign one overarching type to this combined statement, it could be interpreted as primarily <FE> because the detailed facts from the poll are the central focus. However, it is presented within the context of a **<G>** claim. So, you might consider it a combination but if required to choose one:

**Classification: <FE> (Factual Evidence)**.
