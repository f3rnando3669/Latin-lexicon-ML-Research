For 
To classify the argument "Men score better on math than women do. Jerry is a man. Therefore, Jerry is better at math than Sylvia, who is a woman." we will evaluate it step by step according to the provided types: <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>.

1. **Type <G>: Generalization**
   - This involves drawing a conclusion about a group based on a sample.
   - The argument begins with a generalization: "Men score better on math than women do." This is a broad statement about groups (men and women).

2. **Type <FE>: False Equivalence**
   - This occurs when two different cases are presented as similar when they are in fact not.
   - The argument doesn't seem to be establishing the similarity between two distinctly different cases.

3. **Type <IR>: Irrelevant Reasoning**
   - This involves providing a reason that doesn't actually support the conclusion.
   - The reasoning here is directly tied to the conclusion about math ability, so it doesn't seem irrelevant.

4. **Type <RR>: Red Herring**
   - Introduces an irrelevant or secondary subject to divert attention from the main issue.
   - This argument sticks to the topic of math ability and doesn't divert to another subject.

5. **Type <WCB>: Weak Causal Break**
   - Claiming a weak causal relationship which doesn't strongly link cause and effect.
   - The argument doesn't provide a causal relationship but rather an inferential relation based on group statistics.

6. **Type <FU>: False Universal**
   - Applying a general rule to a particular case that may be an exception.
   - "Men score better on math than women do" (general rule) is applied categorically to Jerry and Sylvia without considering individual variations. This could classify as a false universal.

7. **Type <DEP>: Dependency**
   - Involves arguments dependent on the relationship between events, often requiring one to occur for the other to happen.
   - This argument is based on comparative skill levels rather than dependent events.

### Analysis:

- **Step 1:** Determine the nature of the generalization.
  - The argument starts with a generalization about men and women's math scores.

- **Step 2:** Check the conclusion drawn from the generalization.
  - The conclusion that Jerry (an individual man) must be better at math than Sylvia (an individual woman) from the general statement reflects a misuse of a generalization.

### Conclusion:

The argument falls best into the type <FU>: False Universal. The generalization about a statistical average is improperly applied universally to individual cases (Jerry and Sylvia), ignoring the possibility of individual variations that could contradict the conclusion.
