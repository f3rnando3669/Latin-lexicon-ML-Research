For 
To classify the given statement correctly, let's break it down and analyze the progression of the argument from a logical standpoint. The statement is: 

"We can’t freeze the academic year because then students won’t graduate on time. Next thing you know most people will be unemployed and will resort to crime. The crime rate will skyrocket and society will collapse."

Here are the steps:

1. **Identify the initial premise**: The argument starts with "We can’t freeze the academic year." This is presented as a necessary condition to avoid negative outcomes.

2. **Immediate consequence**: The next part is, "because then students won’t graduate on time." This suggests the direct consequence of freezing the academic year.

3. **Chain of consequences**:
    - "Most people will be unemployed" — This is the next link in the causal chain that extends from students not graduating on time.
    - "Will resort to crime" — This implies that unemployment will lead to an increase in criminal activity.
    - "The crime rate will skyrocket" — This is a further consequence of the increase in crime.
    - "Society will collapse" — The final, most extreme outcome in the chain.

The structure of the argument relies heavily on a sequence of increasingly severe predictions, each one dependent on the assumption that the preceding event will inevitably lead to the next. 

4. **Classification**: Examining the nature of the sequence:
    - It starts with a relatively minor policy decision (freezing the academic year).
    - Followed by a series of escalating dire consequences.
    - The final outcome presented is extreme and involves societal collapse.

This type of argument is known as a **slippery slope** argument, where a relatively small first event is suggested to lead to a chain of related events culminating in some significant (usually negative) effect.

Using the given classifications:
- <G> Generalization
- <FE> False Equivalence
- <IR> Irrelevant
- <RR> Red Herring
- <WCB> Weak Causal Break
- <FU> Falsely Universal
- <DEP> (undefined, possibly Dependent/Dependency)

The closest match based on the structure and escalation of the scenario provided is **<WCB> Weak Causal Break**, as it implies that the causality between events in the argument does not strongly support the conclusion.

Therefore, the correct classification for the argument is **<WCB> Weak Causal Break**.
