To classify the statement "The Bible is the Word of God because God tells us it is... in the Bible. X is true because of Y. Y is true because of X." as one of the types <G>, <FE>, <IR>, <RR>, <WCB>, <FU>, or <DEP>, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Understand the core argument**: The argument says that the Bible is the Word of God because God says so in the Bible.

2. **Identify the structure**: The structure is: 
   - Statement 1: X is true because of Y (The Bible is the Word of God because God tells us it is).
   - Statement 2: Y is true because of X (God tells us it is because it is in the Bible).

3. **Determine the logical pattern**: This pattern forms a loop where:
   - X (The Bible is the Word of God) is justified by Y (God tells us it is).
   - Y (God tells us it is) is justified by X (it is in the Bible).

4. **Classify the argument type**:
   - **<G> (Begging the question / Circular Reasoning)**: This is when the conclusion is assumed in one of the premises. Here, the argument is making a circular claim, as it relies on its own assertion to prove itself.

   - **<FE> (False Equivalence)**, **<IR> (Irrelevant Reasoning)**, **<RR> (Red Herring)**, **<WCB> (Weak Analogy / Comparison)**, **<FU> (Faulty Use of Authority)**, **<DEP> (Deceptive Argument)**: These do not apply as clearly as circular reasoning does to this argument.

Given the clear presence of circular reasoning in the argument, we classify it as:

**<G> (Begging the question / Circular Reasoning)**.
