For 
To classify the statement "Eat lamb--could thousands of coyotes be wrong?" according to the given categories, we'll need to understand the categories first and then analyze the statement step by step.

Given categories:
- <G>: Generalization
- <FE>: Faulty Evidence
- <IR>: Irrelevant Reason
- <RR>: Rational Reason
- <WCB>: Weakened/Counter-Argument Based
- <FU>: Failure to Understand
- <DEP>: Dependent Reasoning

Let's break down the statement:

1. **"Eat lamb--could thousands of coyotes be wrong?"**: The statement suggests that since coyotes eat lamb, humans should too. It uses the behavior of coyotes to argue for a dietary choice. The key question is whether the behavior of coyotes is a rational or relevant reason for humans to eat lamb.

2. **Analysis**:
   - The statement relies on the idea that if coyotes (a large number of them) choose to eat lamb, it somehow validates the action for humans.
   - It anthropomorphizes the coyotes' eating habit as an argument for humans to follow suit.

3. **Categorization**:
   - **<G> Generalization**: The statement does not necessarily make a broad generalization. It refers specifically to thousands of coyotes.
   - **<FE> Faulty Evidence**: This fits because the evidence (coyotes eating lamb) is not a reasonable or valid basis for human dietary recommendations.
   - **<IR> Irrelevant Reason**: This also fits because coyotes' eating habits are irrelevant when discussing what humans should eat.
   - **<RR> Rational Reason**: The statement does not present a rational reason for humans to eat lamb.
   - **<WCB> Weakened/Counter-Argument Based**: It does not appear to be a weakened or counter-argument based statement.
   - **<FU> Failure to Understand**: It could be argued if the person genuinely believes coyotes' behavior is relevant to human dietary choices, that could indicate a failure to understand human nutrition.
   - **<DEP> Dependent Reasoning**: The reasoning in the statement is dependent on the assumption that what coyotes do is relevant to human actions, but it is not a complex reasoning structure.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The most fitting categories seem to be <FE> Faulty Evidence and <IR> Irrelevant Reason.

Since we generally pick the most specific category that fits the best, and considering both <FE> and <IR> are applicable, <IR> (Irrelevant Reason) takes precedence because it more precisely describes the core issue with the reasoning rather than just the type of evidence.

Therefore, the classification for "Eat lamb--could thousands of coyotes be wrong?" is **<IR> Irrelevant Reason**.
