Sure, let's classify the statement "Studies show that it takes up to seven years for the human body to digest a piece of gum." step by step using the given categories:

1. **<G> (Generalization):**
   - This category refers to statements that make a broad or sweeping claim that is not supported by specific evidence or details.
   - The statement does not make a broad claim without evidence; it specifically mentions “studies show”.

2. **<FE> (Fact/Example):**
   - This category consists of statements that are verifiable and evidence-based.
   - The statement mentions that “studies show”, implying that there is evidence backing the claim. However, it is important to verify the accuracy of the content. In this case, the content is a common myth; thus, it does not truly fit here.

3. **<IR> (Irrelevant):**
   - This category includes information that is not pertinent to the main discussion or topic at hand.
   - Without additional context about the main topic, it is difficult to judge irrelevance here. Assuming this statement is being assessed in isolation, “irrelevant” seems inappropriate.

4. **<RR> (Refutable/Refuted):**
   - This category includes statements that have been proven false or can be readily refuted.
   - The idea that gum takes seven years to digest is a myth. The human body cannot digest gum, but it passes through the digestive system relatively unchanged. Therefore, the statement can be classified as refutable.

5. **<WCB> (Well-Constructed Belief):**
   - This category includes beliefs that are well-argued and supported by evidence, though not necessarily true.
   - The phrase "studies show" gives it an appearance of evidence-based reasoning, but since the actual content is based on a myth, it isn't a well-constructed belief.

6. **<FU> (Future):**
   - This category includes statements about what will happen in the future.
   - The statement is about a past claim regarding the digestion period of gum, not about future events.

7. **<DEP> (Dependent):**
   - This category covers statements that depend on other statements or conditions to be true.
   - The statement stands alone and asserts something without conditional dependency on another statement.

Given these assessments, the most fitting category for the statement "Studies show that it takes up to seven years for the human body to digest a piece of gum." is:

**<RR> (Refutable/Refuted)** as it is a myth that has been disproven.
