For 
Certainly! Let's classify the given statement step by step:

1. **Identify the main argument:**
   - "The museum's new gemstones and precious minerals exhibit needs more security guards."

2. **Identify the additional assertion and its relationship with the main argument:**
   - "If you don't agree, then you must be planning to steal a piece of the exhibit."
   - This suggests a conditional statement linked to the main argument.

3. **Analyze the reasoning:**
   - The main argument suggests a need for more security guards.
   - The additional assertion implies that anyone who disagrees with this need is planning to steal from the exhibit.

4. **Classify the type using the definitions:**

   - **<G> (Generalization):** This would suggest making a broad statement about a whole group based on limited evidence.
   - **<FE> (False Equivalence):** This would suggest comparing two things as equivalent when they are not.
   - **<IR> (Irrelevant Reasoning):** Offering a reason that is not logically connected to the argument's conclusion.
   - **<RR> (Red Herring):** Distracting from the actual argument or issue.
   - **<WCB> (Weak Causal Claim):** Claiming a causality where the relationship is weak or unfounded.
   - **<FU> (Faulty Uncertainty):** Claiming something cannot be known or is uncertain without justification.
   - **<DEP> (Dependency Argument):** Arguments that rely heavily on additional factors to hold.

Upon analyzing, it is clear that the statement "If you don't agree, then you must be planning to steal a piece of the exhibit" is an example of false reasoning that does not logically follow from someone simply disagreeing with the need for more security. It imposes an extreme and unfounded motive on anyone who disagrees.

Therefore, this is a classic example of an **<IR> (Irrelevant Reasoning)**. The additional assertion does not logically relate to the main argument and instead introduces a baseless assumption about the intentions of those who might disagree. 

Thus, the statement is classified as **<IR>**.
