For 
Let's apply the Full_Sent analysis to the sentence: "In that case, it must surely wait till they are ready."

### Step 1: Clause and Sentence Type Identification (<IDAnalysis>)
**Objective:** Identify the clauses and sentence type of the given sentence.

1. **Identify Independent Clauses:**
   - Locate and count the independent clauses in the sentence.
   - Determine if the sentence is simple (<S>), compound (<C>), complex (<CC>), or compound-complex (<CXC>).

2. **Analysis:**
   - Independent Clause: "it must surely wait till they are ready."
   - Dependent Clause: "till they are ready" (acts as a part of the independent clause; modifying "wait")

3. **Sentence Type:** Complex (<CC>)

### Step 2: Opening Identification (<OAnalysis>)
**Objective:** Identify the type of opening the sentence has.

1. **Classify the Opener:**
   - Determine if the sentence opens with a transition word (<T>), a direct statement (<D>), a clause (<C>), or a question (<Q>).

2. **Analysis:**
   - Opener: "In that case,"
   - **Type:** Clause Opener (<C>)

### Step 3: Rhetorical Type Identification (<RTAnalysis>)
**Objective:** Identify the rhetorical type of the sentence.

1. **Classify the Sentence Structure:**
   - Determine if the sentence follows a loose (<L>), periodic (<P>), balanced (<B>), or antithetical (<A>) structure.

2. **Analysis:**
   - Structure: The sentence opens with a dependent clause ("In that case,") followed by the main clause ("it must surely wait till they are ready.")
   - **Type:** Periodic (<P>)

### Step 4: Meter Analysis (<MAAnalysis>)
**Objective:** Identify the type of rhetorical meter in the sentence.

1. **Analyze Syllable Patterns:**
   - Break down the sentence into syllables and identify the patterns.

2. **Analysis:**
   - "In that case" -> 3 syllables (unstressed, stressed, unstressed)
   - "it must surely wait" -> 5 syllables (unstressed, stressed, stressed, unstressed, stressed)
   - "till they are ready" -> 5 syllables (stressed, unstressed, unstressed, unstressed, stressed)

Given the combination of stressed and unstressed syllables, it seems to mix various meters, primarily trochaic and iambic.

3. **Meter:** Predominantly Trochaic (<t>) and Iambic (<i>)

### Step 5: Function of Sentence Identification (<SentType>)
**Objective:** Identify the functional type of the sentence (statement, question, command, exclamation).

1. **Classify the Sentence Function:**
   - Determine if the sentence is a statement (<S>), question (<Q>), command (<C>), or exclamation (<E>).

2. **Analysis:**
   - **Function:** Statement (<S>)

### Step 6: Rhythmic and Euphony Identification (<RhAnalysis>)
**Objective:** Identify the rhythm and euphony of the sentence.

1. **Apply MAAnalysis:**
   - Utilize the meter analysis to determine the rhythmic patterns.

2. **Determine Overall Flow:**
   - Assess if the sentence is smooth and flowing (<SM>), rhythmic and balanced (<RB>), complex and varied (<CV>), or jerky and abrupt (<JA>).

3. **Analysis:**
   - The sentence is relatively smooth, with a natural flow given the use of clauses and varied stress patterns.
   - **Rhythm and Euphony:** Smooth and flowing (<SM>)

### Full_Sent Example
**Given Sentence:**
*"In that case, it must surely wait till they are ready."*

1. **IDAnalysis:**
   - Independent Clauses: "it must surely wait till they are ready."
   - Dependent Clause: "In that case"
   - **Type:** Complex (<CC>)

2. **OAnalysis:**
   - **Opener:** Clause opener (<C>)

3. **RTAnalysis:**
   - **Rhetorical Type:** Periodic (<P>)

4. **MAAnalysis:**
   - **Meter:** Predominantly Trochaic (<t>) and Iambic (<i>)

5. **SentType:**
   - **Function:** Statement (<S>)

6. **RhAnalysis:**
   - **Rhythm and Euphony:** Smooth and flowing (<SM>)

Therefore, the sentence "In that case, it must surely wait till they are ready." is a Complex (<CC>) sentence with a Clause opener (<C>) of Periodic rhetorical type (<P>), predominantly Trochaic (<t>) and Iambic (<i>) meter, functioning as a Statement (<S>), with a Smooth and Flowing rhythm and euphony (<SM>).
