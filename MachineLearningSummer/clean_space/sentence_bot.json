\"This wisdom have I seen also under the sun\" (independent clause)\n   - \"and it seemed great unto me\" (independent clause)\n\n2. **Identify clause types**:\n   - \"This wisdom have I seen also under the sun\" (independent)\n   -

\"This wisdom have I seen also under the sun\" (starts with a direct statement)\n\n2. **Categorize the type of opener**:\n   - Direct statement -> \\<D\\>.\n\n### Step 3: \\<RTAnalysis\\>\n\n1. **Analyze the structure**:\n   -
