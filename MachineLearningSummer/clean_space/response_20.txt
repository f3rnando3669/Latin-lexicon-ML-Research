For 
Let's apply <Full_Sent> to the string "I went to the park, and my sister stayed home."

### Step 1: Clause and Sentence Type Identification (<IDAnalysis>)
**Steps:**
1.1. Identify the clauses present in the sentence (independent and dependent).
- Independent clause 1: "I went to the park"
- Independent clause 2: "my sister stayed home"

1.2. Determine if the sentence is simple (<S>), compound (<C>), complex (<CC>), or compound-complex (<CXC>).
- Sentence type: Compound (<C>)

### Step 2: Sentence Opener Identification (<OAnalysis>)
**Steps:**
2.1. Examine the beginning of the sentence to identify if it starts with a transitional word/phrase (<T>), a direct statement (<D>), a clause opener (<C>), or a question (<Q>).
- Opener: Direct statement (<D>)

### Step 3: Rhetorical Type Identification (<RTAnalysis>)
**Steps:**
3.1. Analyze the sentence to determine if it follows a loose (<L>), periodic (<P>), balanced (<B>), or antithetical (<A>) rhetorical structure.
- Rhetorical type: Balanced (<B>) (The phrases "I went to the park" and "my sister stayed home" balance each other by structure and meaning.)

### Step 4: Rhetorical Meter Identification (<MAAnalysis>)
**Steps:**
4.1. Break down the sentence into syllables and identify the stress pattern to determine if it matches iambic (<i>), trochaic (<t>), anapestic (<a>), dactylic (<d>), or spondaic (<sp>) metrical patterns.
- Detailed syllable analysis:
  - "I went to the park": Unstressed "I", stressed "went", unstressed "to", stressed "the", stressed "park" (Mixed patterns, primarily trochaic)
  - "and my sister stayed home": Unstressed "and", stressed "my", stressed "sister", unstressed "stayed", stressed "home" (Mixed patterns, primarily trochaic)

4.2. Combined metrical type: Trochaic with some variation (<t>)

### Step 5: Rhythm and Euphony Identification (<RhAnalysis>)
**Steps:**
5.1. Use the results from <MAAnalysis> to classify the sentence as smooth and flowing (<SM>), rhythmic and balanced (<RB>), complex and varied (<CV>), or jerky and abrupt (<JA>).
- Rhythm and Euphony: Rhythmic and balanced (<RB>), as the sentence exhibits a symmetrical structure and parallelism.

### Step 6: Sentence Function Identification (<SentType>)
**Steps:**
6.1. Determine if the sentence is a statement (<S>), a question (<Q>), a command (<C>), or an exclamation (<E>).
- Function: Statement (<S>)

### Combined Result of <Full_Sent> for the example string <s>
- **Clauses and Sentence Type**: Two independent clauses "I went to the park" and "my sister stayed home": Compound (<C>)
- **Opener Type**: Direct statement (<D>)
- **Rhetorical Type**: Balanced (<B>)
- **Rhetorical Meter**: Trochaic with some variation (<t>)
- **Rhythm and Euphony**: Rhythmic and balanced (<RB>)
- **Sentence Function**: Statement (<S>)

So, the comprehensive analysis for the string "I went to the park, and my sister stayed home" is:

- **Clauses and Sentence Type**: Compound (<C>)
- **Opener Type**: Direct statement (<D>)
- **Rhetorical Type**: Balanced (<B>)
- **Rhetorical Meter**: Trochaic with some variation (<t>)
- **Rhythm and Euphony**: Rhythmic and balanced (<RB>)
- **Sentence Function**: Statement (<S>)
