For 
Let's apply the <Full_Sent> analysis to the string "It is a deliverance which does not deliver."

### Clause and Sentence Type Identification (<IDAnalysis>)
1. **Break down the given sentence into clauses:**
   - "It is a deliverance" (independent clause)
   - "which does not deliver" (dependent clause)
2. **Identify each clause as either independent or dependent:**
   - "It is a deliverance" is an independent clause.
   - "which does not deliver" is a dependent clause.
3. **Determine the overall sentence type based on the combination of clauses:**
   - The sentence contains one independent clause and one dependent clause, so it is a complex sentence (<CC>).

### Opening Identification (<OAnalysis>)
1. **Examine the opening segment of the sentence:**
   - The opening segment is "It is a deliverance".
2. **Check if the opening fits any of the predefined types:**
   - The opening is a direct statement: <D>.

### Rhetorical Type Identification (<RTAnalysis>)
1. **Analyze the structural pattern of the sentence:**
   - "It is a deliverance" (main clause) + "which does not deliver" (dependent clause).
2. **Determine if the sentence follows any of the defined rhetorical types:**
   - The sentence places the main clause first, followed by a dependent clause, fitting the loose rhetorical type <L>.

### Rhetorical Meter Identification (<MAAnalysis>)
1. **Identify the syllable structure of the sentence:**
   - "It is (unstressed, stressed)" - trochaic (<t>)
   - "a de-liv-er-ance (unstressed, unstressed, stressed, unstressed, unstressed)" - combination of unclassified syllables.
   - "which does not (stressed, unstressed, stressed)" - anapestic (<a>)
   - "de-liv-er (unstressed, stressed, unstressed) - combination unclassified syllables.
2. **Classify the identified structure according to defined meters:**
   - Dominantly trochaic (t) with some anapestic (a) patterns.

### Rhythm and Euphony Identification (<RhAnalysis>)
1. **Apply <MAAnalysis> to determine rhythm patterns:**
   - The rhythm is a mix of trochaic and anapestic meters.
2. **Categorize the rhythm and euphony based on the identified meter and structure:**
   - Given the mixed patterns, it fits "Complex and varied" <CV>.

### Sentence Type Function Identification (<SentType>)
1. **Identify whether the sentence is a statement (<S>):**
   - Yes, the sentence is a statement.

Now let’s combine all analyses:

**Full Sentence Analysis (<Full_Sent>):**
- **Clause and Sentence Type Identification (<ID>):** Complex Sentence (<CC>)
- **Opening Identification (<O>):** Direct Statement (<D>)
- **Rhetorical Type Identification (<RT>):** Loose Rhetorical Type (<L>)
- **Rhetorical Meter Identification (<MA>):** Trochaic and Anapestic Patterns (<t> and <a>)
- **Rhythm and Euphony Identification (<Rh>):** Complex and Varied (<CV>)
- **Sentence Type Function Identification (<SentType>):** Statement (<S>)

### Summary:

The string "It is a deliverance which does not deliver." is a complex sentence (<CC>) that opens with a direct statement (<D>). It follows the loose rhetorical type (<L>) with a mix of trochaic (<t>) and anapestic (<a>) meters, resulting in a complex and varied rhythm and euphony (<CV>). The function of the sentence is a statement (<S>).
