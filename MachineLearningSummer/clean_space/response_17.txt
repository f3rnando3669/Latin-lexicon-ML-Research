For 
Let's apply the **Full_Sent** analysis to the sentence: "We but half express ourselves, and are ashamed of that divine idea which each of us represents."

### Step-by-Step Breakdown:

#### Step 1: Identifying Clauses and Sentence Type <IDAnalysis>

1. **Decomposition:**
   - Clause 1: "We but half express ourselves" (independent clause)
   - Clause 2: "and are ashamed of that divine idea" (independent clause)
   - Dependent Clause: "which each of us represents" (dependent clause modifying "that divine idea")
   
2. **Sentence Type:**
   - This is a <CXC> sentence (complex-compound) with two independent clauses and one dependent clause.

#### Step 2: Identifying the Type of Opening <OAnalysis>

1. **Decomposition:**
   - Opener: "We but half express ourselves"
   
2. **Type of Opening:**
   - This is a direct statement opener <D>.

#### Step 3: Identifying the Rhetorical Type <RTAnalysis>

1. **Decomposition:**
   - Analyzing the structure:
     - The sentence predominantly balances the independent clauses using "and," showing a relationship between the two ideas.
   
2. **Rhetorical Type:**
   - The sentence has elements of <A> (antithetical rhetoric), juxtaposing the two independent clauses.

#### Step 4: Identifying Rhetorical Meter <MAAnalysis>

1. **Decomposition:**
   - Breaking down into syllables and stress:
     - "We but half express ourselves," (stressed-unstressed patterns, seems mostly <t>)
     - "and are ashamed of that divine idea" (similar stressed-unstressed patterns, <t>)
     - "which each of us represents." (mixed meter, likely closer to <sp> but could contain small portions of <t>)

2. **Rhetorical Meter:**
   - Mostly a combination of <t> (unstressed-stressed) and <sp> (both syllables unstressed).

#### Step 5: Identifying Rhythm and Euphony <RhAnalysis>

1. **Decomposition:**
   - Using **MAAnalysis** data:
     - The mixture of <t> and <sp> creates a somewhat balanced but varied rhythm.

2. **Rhythm and Euphony:**
   - This falls under <CV> (Complex and varied).

#### Step 6: Identifying Sentence Function <SentType>

1. **Decomposition:**
   - Function: The sentence makes a statement about expressing ideas and feelings.
   
2. **Sentence Function:**
   - It is a statement <S>.

### Full_Sent Analysis:
- **IDAnalysis:** <CXC> (complex-compound)
- **OAnalysis:** <D> (direct statement opener)
- **RTAnalysis:** <A> (antithetical rhetoric)
- **MAAnalysis:** Mix of <t> and <sp>
- **RhAnalysis:** <CV> (Complex and varied)
- **SentType:** <S> (statement)

#### Summary:
- The sentence "We but half express ourselves, and are ashamed of that divine idea which each of us represents." is a **complex-compound** sentence with a **direct statement** opener. It utilizes **antithetical rhetoric**, primarily features a mix of **unstressed-stressed** and **unstressed-unstressed** patterns, and exhibits a **complex and varied** rhythm, ultimately serving as a **statement**.
