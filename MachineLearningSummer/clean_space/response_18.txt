Sure, let's apply the <Full_Sent> analysis to the string "I alone cannot change the world, but I can cast a stone across the water to create many ripples."

### Step 1: Identify Clauses and Sentence Type (<IDAnalysis>)
- **Step 1:** Break down the sentence to identify independent and dependent clauses.
  - **Independent Clause 1:** I alone cannot change the world,
  - **Independent Clause 2:** but I can cast a stone across the water to create many ripples.

- **Step 2:** Determine whether the sentence is simple (S), compound (C), complex (CC), or complex-compound (CXC).
  - The sentence is a compound sentence (<C>) because it consists of at most two independent clauses.

### Step 2: Identify the Type of Opening (<OAnalysis>)
- **Step 3:** Analyze the beginning of the sentence to identify if the opener is transitional (T), a direct statement (D), a clause opener (C), or a question (Q).
  - The opener "I alone" is a direct statement (D).

### Step 3: Identify the Rhetorical Type (<RTAnalysis>)
- **Step 4:** Examine the structure of the sentence to determine if it is loose (L), periodic (P), balanced (B), or antithetical (A).
  - The sentence is antithetical (A), as it juxtaposes two opposing ideas: not changing the world versus creating ripples.

### Step 4: Identify the Type of Rhetorical Meter (<MAAnalysis>)
- **Step 5:** Break down the sentence into its syllabic components and identify the meter patterns, such as iambic (<i>), trochaic (<t>), anapestic (<a>), dactylic (<d>), or spondaic (<sp>).
  - "I alone cannot change the world": / x x / x x / x x /.
  - "but I can cast a stone across the water": x / x / x / x / x x /.
  - "to create many ripples": x x / x /.

  The patterns are mixed, primarily characterized by alternating unstressed and stressed syllables (<t> patterns).
  
### Step 5: Identify the Rhythm and Euphony (<RhAnalysis>)
- **Step 6:** Use the results from <MAAnalysis> to determine the overall rhythm and euphony of the sentence, and classify it as smooth and flowing (SM), rhythmic and balanced (RB), complex and varied (CV), or jerky or abrupt (JA).
  - Given the mixed rhythmic patterns, the sentence has a "Complex and varied" rhythm and euphony (<CV>).

### Step 6: Identify the Function of the Sentence (<SentType>)
- **Step 7:** Determine if the sentence is a statement (S), question (Q), command (C), or exclamation (E).
  - The sentence is a statement (S).

### Summary of Task <Full_Sent>

Based on the above analysis, we can classify the sentence "I alone cannot change the world, but I can cast a stone across the water to create many ripples" as follows:

1. **<IDAnalysis>**
   - Clauses: Two independent clauses.
   - Sentence Type: Compound (<C>).

2. **<OAnalysis>**
   - Opener: Direct Statement (<D>).

3. **<RTAnalysis>**
   - Rhetorical Type: Antithetical (<A>).

4. **<MAAnalysis>**
   - Rhetorical Meter: Mixed, primarily Trochaic (<t>).

5. **<RhAnalysis>**
   - Rhythm and Euphony: Complex and Varied (<CV>).

6. **<SentType>**
   - Function: Statement (<S>).

Thus, the complete <Full_Sent> analysis for the given string is:
**Compound (<C>), Direct Statement (<D>), Antithetical (<A>), Mixed, primarily Trochaic (<t>), Complex and Varied (<CV>), Statement (<S>)**.
