### Applying <Full_Sent> to the Sentence: "That a tale shall accomplish something and arrive somewhere"

Let's systematically analyze this sentence using the steps defined in <Full_Sent>.

#### Step 1: IDAnalysis

1. **Identify the number of independent clauses:**
   - The sentence "That a tale shall accomplish something and arrive somewhere" contains one main idea but no independent clause due to the absence of a subject performing an action outside of the clause structure.
   
2. **Identify the number of dependent clauses:**
   - The sentence appears to be primarily a fragment or a dependent clause due to its inability to stand alone as a complete thought.

3. **Classify the sentence type:**
   - Since it does not fit clearly into any defined sentence type with at least one independent clause, the sentence seems incomplete or subordinating. However, for this exercise, we might treat the "That a tale shall accomplish something and arrive somewhere" as a dependent clause due to its formal appearance.
   - **Classification:** Ambiguous, leaning towards <CC> (complex sentence with a dependent clause).

#### Step 2: OAnalysis

1. **Identify the opening of the sentence:**
   - The sentence opens with a clause.

2. **Classify the identified opening:**
   - **Classification:** <C>.

#### Step 3: RTAnalysis

1. **Identify the structure of the sentence and its rhetorical type:**
   - The sentence seems to provide a fragmented, leading thought, missing a main clause.

2. **Classify the identified rhetorical type:**
   - Based on the structure and intent, it appears closest to periodic (even though imcomplete).
   - **Classification:** Ambiguous, weakly leaning towards <P>.

#### Step 4: RhAnalysis

1. **Apply MAAnalysis to identify the meter:**
   - Break it down into syllables: "That (unstressed) a (unstressed) tale (stressed) shall (unstressed) ac-com-plish (secondary stressed, unstressed, stressed) some-thing (stressed, unstressed) and (unstressed) a-rrive (unstressed, stressed) some-where (stressed, unstressed)."
   - Analysis indicates mixed meters.

2. **Determine the rhythmic and euphonic quality:**
   - The mix of unstressed and stressed syllables indicates an irregular meter.
   - **Classification:** <CV> (complex and varied).

#### Step 5: SentType

1. **Analyze the function of the sentence:**
   - The sentence provides a statement, despite being a fragment or subordinating idea.
   
2. **Classify the function:**
   - **Classification:** <S>.

**Final Analysis:**
- **Sentence Type:** Ambiguously dependent, leaning towards <CC> as a fragmentary sub-clause misunderstood without its main clause.
- **Opener Type:** <C>
- **Rhetorical Type:** Ambiguously weak toward Periodic <P>
- **Rhythm and Euphony:** <CV>
- **Function:** <S>

**Putting it all together**, the analysis looks like:
"<CC>, <C>, <P>, <CV>, <S>."

Given the incomplete nature and fragment stand-alone, the true <Full_Sent> identification remains problematic without full context or clarity of dependent versus independent recognition.
