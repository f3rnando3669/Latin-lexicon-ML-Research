For 
Let's apply <Full_Sent> to the string "But the Deerslayer tale accomplishes nothing and arrives in the air."

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **<IDAnalysis>**:
   - **Identify Clauses**:
     - Independent Clause 1: "the Deerslayer tale accomplishes nothing"
     - Independent Clause 2: "arrives in the air"
   - **Determine Sentence Type**:
     - Two independent clauses without any dependent clauses -> Compound sentence (<C>).

2. **<OAnalysis>**:
   - **Analyze the Opener**:
     - Opener: "But" -> Transitional word or phrase (<T>).

3. **<RTAnalysis>**:
   - **Examine the Structure**:
     - The sentence contains two independent clauses joined by the conjunction "and".
     - This doesn't follow a loose or periodic structure, and it isn't particularly balanced. However, it could be considered antithetical because the two clauses could be seen as contrasting achievements ("accomplishes nothing" vs. "arrives in the air").
     - So, although not a perfect fit, it aligns somewhat with antithetical structure (<A>).

4. **<MAAnalysis>**:
   - **Break Down the Syllable Patterns**:
     - "But the Deer-slay-er tale ac-com-plish-es noth-ing" (Pattern might vary but primarily mixed rhythms).
     - "ar-rives in the air" (Likely mixed rhythm too).
     - This doesn't clearly fit standard patterns (<i>, <t>, <a>, <d>, or <sp>). Thus, we might broadly call it a mixed meter.

5. **<RhAnalysis>**:
   - **Apply <MAAnalysis> and Determine Rhythm and Euphony**:
     - Given the mixed meter, the rhythm is not particularly smooth or jerky, but it does have a certain balance due to the interplay of clauses.
     - This would place it in the category of "Complex and varied" (<CV>).

6. **<SentType>**:
   - **Identify Sentence Function**:
     - The sentence is making a statement about the Deerslayer tale, so it is a statement (<S>).

### Full Sentence Analysis Summary:

1. **Clauses and Sentence Type**: Compound sentence (<C>).
2. **Sentence Opener**: Transitional word or phrase (<T>).
3. **Rhetorical Type**: Antithetical structure (<A>).
4. **Rhetorical Meter**: Mixed meter.
5. **Rhythm and Euphony**: Complex and varied (<CV>).
6. **Sentence Function**: Statement (<S>).

Overall:
- **<ID>**: <C>
- **<O>**: <T>
- **<RT>**: <A>
- **<MA>**: Mixed
- **<Rh>**: <CV>
- **<SentType>**: <S>
