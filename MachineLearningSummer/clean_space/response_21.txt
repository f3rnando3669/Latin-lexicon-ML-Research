  - This sentence is made up of one independent clause and one dependent clause, which makes it a complex sentence.
  - Sentence Type: <CC>

#### 2. <OAnalysis> (Identifying the Type of Opening)

          - Because (2 syllables), the soup (2 syllables), was too (2 syllables), cold (1 syllable), I warmed (2 syllables), it in (2 syllables), the microwave (3 syllables).
        - **Step 2:** Identify the stress pattern for each syllable.
          - Because (i), the soup (t), was too (t), cold (s), I warmed (t), it in (t), the microwave (d).
        - **Step 3:** Classify each metrical unit:
          - Because (<t>), the soup (<t>), was too (<t>), cold (<d>), I warmed (<t>), it in (<t>), the microwave (<d>).
- **Step 2:** Combine the metrical patterns to ascertain the overall rhythm and euphony.
  - With <t> and <d> patterns, the sentence has a mix of smooth and rhythmic characteristics.
  - Rhythm and Euphony: <RB>

#### 5. <SentType> (Identifying the Function of the Sentence)
