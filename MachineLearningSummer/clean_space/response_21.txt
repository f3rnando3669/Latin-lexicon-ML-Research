For 
Let's apply the steps outlined in **Full_Sent** to the string "It is a deliverance which does not deliver."

### Full_Sent: Comprehensive Sentence Analysis

**Input String:** "It is a deliverance which does not deliver."

1. **IDAnalysis (Clause and Sentence Type Identification):**
   - **Step 1:** Parse \( s \) to identify the number of independent and dependent clauses.
     - Independent clause: "It is a deliverance"
     - Dependent clause: "which does not deliver"
   - **Step 2:** Classify \( s \) into one of the sentence types: Simple (<S>), Compound (<C>), Complex (<CC>), or Complex-Compound (<CXC>).
     - Since there is one independent clause and one dependent clause, it is a Complex sentence (<CC>).

2. **OAnalysis (Opening Type Identification):**
   - **Step 1:** Examine the opening word or phrase of \( s \).
     - Opener: "It is"
   - **Step 2:** Determine whether the opener is a transitional word (<T>), a direct statement (<D>), a clause (<C>), or a question (<Q>).
     - Since it directly starts with a statement, it falls under a direct statement (<D>).

3. **RTAnalysis (Rhetorical Type Identification):**
   - **Step 1:** Analyze the syntactic structure of \( s \) for patterns.
     - The sentence begins with the independent clause "It is a deliverance" and then continues with the dependent clause "which does not deliver."
   - **Step 2:** Classify \( s \) as Loose (<L>), Periodic (<P>), Balanced (<B>), or Antithetical (<A>).
     - The main clause comes first followed by the dependent clause. Thus, it is a Loose structure (<L>).

4. **MAAnalysis (Rhetorical Meter Identification):**
   - **Step 1:** Identify the syllable patterns in \( s \).
     - "It is a de-li-ver-ance" (unstressed-stressed, unstressed-stressed)
     - "which does not de-liv-er" (unstressed-stressed, unstressed-stressed)
   - **Step 2:** Determine whether the meter is Iambic (<i>), Trochaic (<t>), Anapestic (<a>), Dactylic (<d>), or Spondaic (<sp>).
     - The sentence mainly uses an unstressed-stressed pattern, characteristic of Iambic meter (<i>).

5. **RhAnalysis (Rhythm and Euphony Identification):**
   - **Step 1:** Apply MAAnalysis finding (Iambic meter <i>).
   - **Step 2:** Use results from MAAnalysis to categorize \( s \) into one of the rhythmic and euphony types: Smooth and flowing (<SM>), Rhythmic and balanced (<RB>), Complex and varied (<CV>), or Jerky or abrupt (<JA>).
     - The predominant Iambic meter suggests a Smooth and flowing rhythm (<SM>).

6. **SentType (Sentence Function Identification):**
   - **Step 1:** Analyze the intent behind \( s \).
   - **Step 2:** Classify \( s \) as a Statement (<S>), Question (<Q>), Command (<C>), or Exclamation (<E>).
     - The sentence is a statement about deliverance.

### Result
\[
\begin{align*}
&\text{Clause and Sentence Type:} \, <CC> \\
&\text{Opening Type:} \, <D> \\
&\text{Rhetorical Type:} \, <L> \\
&\text{Meter:} \, <i> \\
&\text{Rhythm and Euphony:} \, <SM> \\
&\text{Sentence Function:} \, <S> \\
\end{align*}
\]

Thus, the analysis of the string "It is a deliverance which does not deliver." according to Full_Sent yields:
- **ID (Clause and Sentence Type):** <CC>
- **O (Opening Type):** <D>
- **RT (Rhetorical Type):** <L>
- **MA (Meter):** <i>
- **Rh (Rhythm and Euphony):** <SM>
- **SentType:** <S>
