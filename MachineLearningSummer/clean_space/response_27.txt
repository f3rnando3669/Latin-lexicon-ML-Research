Alright, let's apply the steps of <Full_Sent> to analyze the string:

### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### Step 1: Clause Identification and Sentence Type
- **Examine the sentence structure to identify clauses:**
  - Clause 1: "They may have it in well-doing"
    - Independent Clause
  - Clause 2: "they may have it in learning"
    - Independent Clause
  - Clause 3: "they may have it even in criticising"
    - Independent Clause

- **Classify the sentence based on identified clauses:**
  - The sentence contains three independent clauses.
  - According to our definitions, a sentence with exactly two independent clauses and no dependent clauses is classified as <C>.
  - However, our sentence has three independent clauses and no dependent clauses. Thus, it doesn't perfectly fit the predefined <S>, <C>, <CC>, or <CXC> definitions.
  - It could be considered a special case of a compound sentence with an additional independent clause, so you might argue for a type like extended compound (though not explicitly defined).

#### Step 2: Determine Opening Type
- **Examine the initial part of the sentence:**
  - The sentence starts directly with the independent clause "They may have it in well-doing".
  
- **Classify it based on predefined types:**
  - The sentence opener appears to be a direct statement <D>.

#### Step 3: Rhetorical Type Identification
- **Analyze the structural features:**
  - The sentence shows parallelism in its structure, repeating "they may have it in..."

- **Classify the rhetorical style based on features:**
  - This is a classic example of a balanced rhetorical type (as it presents phrases that balance each other by virtue of their similar structure and meaning): <B>

#### Step 4: Identify Rhetorical Meter
- **Segment the sentence into syllables and identify stress patterns:**
  - For simplicity, treating the structure for analysis of rhythm:
    - "They may have it in well-doing" (unstressed, stressed, unstressed, unstressed, stressed, unstressed, unstressed).
    - "they may have it in learning" ( unstressed, stressed, unstressed, unstressed, stressed, unstressed).
    - "they may have it even in criticising" (unstressed, stressed, unstressed, unstressed, unstressed, stressed, unstressed).
  
- **Classify according to predefined meters:**
  - The typical patterns in the clauses lean towards iambic meter: <t>
  - Though not strictly perfect iambic pentameter overall, it has an overarching alternation of unstressed and stressed.

#### Step 5: Rhythm and Euphony Classification
- **Integrate results from meter analysis:**
  - Rely on the identified use of predictable, parallel alternating stress patterns.

- **Determine rhythm and euphony classification:**
  - With repetition and structural balance, classified under "Smooth and flowing" <SM>.

#### Step 6: Identify Sentence Function
- **Categorize the sentence’s function:**
  - This particular sentence is making a statement: <S>

### Combined Results:

- **Clause Identification and Sentence Type:** Not exactly fitting predefined <CXC>, identified as an extended compound with three independent clauses.
- **Opening Type:** <D> (Direct Statement)
- **Rhetorical Type:** <B> (Balanced)
- **Rhetorical Meter:** Combination aligns closely with <t> (iambic)
- **Rhythm and Euphony:** <SM> (Smooth and flowing)
- **Sentence Function:** <S> (Statement)

### Conclusion:

Fully analyzed sentence: 
- **Type:** Extended compound (3 independent clauses)
- **Opener:** <D>
- **Rhetoric:** <B> 
- **Meter:** Predominantly <t>
- **Rhythm and Euphony:** <SM>
- **Function:** <S>
