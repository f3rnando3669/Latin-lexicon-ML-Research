For 
Certainly! Let's apply the <Full_Sent> analysis to the given string "But the Deerslayer tale accomplishes nothing and arrives in the air."

### Step-by-Step Full Sentence Analysis (<Full_Sent>):

1. **Identify Clauses and Sentence Type (<IDAnalysis>):**

   - **Independent Clauses:** 
     - "the Deerslayer tale accomplishes nothing"
     - "arrives in the air"
   - There are no dependent clauses.
   - **Sentence Type:** 
     - This is a compound sentence (<C>) with two independent clauses connected by the conjunction "and".

2. **Identify the Type of Opening (<OAnalysis>):**

   - **Opener:** "But"
   - **Type:** Transitional opener (<T>)

3. **Identify the Rhetorical Type (<RTAnalysis>):**

   - The sentence has a structure where two independent clauses are balanced in length and form.
   - **Rhetorical Type:** Balanced rhetorical type (<B>)

4. **Identify the Rhetorical Meter (<MAAnalysis>):**

   - Let's break down the meter:
        - **"But the Deerslayer tale accomplishes nothing"**
           - But (unstressed/stressed) = iambic (<t>)
           - the Deer-slay-er (unstressed/STRESSED/unstressed/unstressed/STRESSED) = mixed
           - tale ac-com-plish-es no-thing (unstressed/STRESSED/unstressed/unstressed/STRESSED) = iambic (<t>)
        - **"and arrives in the air"**
           - and (unstressed) = unstressed/spontane characterization
           - ar-rives (unstressed/STRESSED) = iambic (<t>)
           - in the air (unstressed/unstressed/STRESSED) = anapestic (<a>)
   - Since there's a mixture of patterns, but primarily iambic, we can determine mixed meter involving iambic (<t>), anapestic (<a>), and other mixed forms.

5. **Identify the Rhythm and Euphony (<RhAnalysis>):**

   - With its usage of balanced independent clauses and a consistent flow, the rhythm can be considered "Rhythmic and balanced" (<RB>).

6. **Identify the Function of the Sentence (<SentType>):**

   - The sentence is making a statement.
   - **Function:** Statement (<S>)

### Putting It All Together:
1. **Clauses and Sentence Type:**
   - **Clauses:** 2 independent.
   - **Sentence Type:** <C>

2. **Opener Type:** <T>

3. **Rhetorical Type:** <B>

4. **Rhetorical Meter:** Combination involving <t>, <a> (primarily iambic with anapestic)

5. **Rhythm and Euphony:** <RB>

6. **Function:** <S>

### Full Annotation:
s: "But the Deerslayer tale accomplishes nothing and arrives in the air."
- **ID: <C>**
- **O: <T>**
- **RT: <B>**
- **MA: <t><a>**
- **Rh: <RB>**
- **SentType: <S>**

By systematically breaking down the sentence using these steps, we have comprehensively categorized its structure, rhythm, and function.
