For 
Let's conduct a full sentence analysis (<Full_Sent>) on the string "This creative power works with elements, with materials; what if it has not those materials, those elements, ready for its use?"

### 1. **Clause and Sentence Type Identification (<IDAnalysis>):**
**1.1. Identify all clauses:**
   - Independent clause 1: "This creative power works with elements, with materials"
   - Independent clause 2: "what if it has not those materials, those elements, ready for its use?"
   
**1.2. Determine sentence type:**
   - This sentence contains two independent clauses, separated by a semicolon.
   - Thus, it is a compound sentence (<C>).

### 2. **Sentence Opener Identification (<OAnalysis>):**
**2.1. Examine the beginning:**
   - The sentence begins with "This creative power".

**2.2. Classify the opener:**
   - This is a direct statement opener (<D>).

### 3. **Rhetorical Type Identification (<RTAnalysis>):**
**3.1. Analyze the structure:**
   - The two independent clauses have a balanced structure, with a clear paralleling of materials and elements.

**3.2. Identify rhetorical type:**
   - The second part juxtaposes a hypothetical scenario to the first, showing a contrast or implication.
   - Therefore, it fits the antithetical rhetorical type (<A>) where opposing ideas are juxtaposed.

### 4. **Rhetorical Meter Analysis (<MAAnalysis>):**
**4.1. Break down syllables and stress patterns:**
   - "This cre-a-tive pow-er works with el-e-ments, with ma-te-ri-als; "
     - Pattern: Possesses mixed stress, potentially identifying as iambic (<t> for variability).
   - "what if it has not those ma-te-ri-als, those el-e-ments, read-y for its use?"
     - Pattern: Similarly includes variable stress and unstressed pairings, closely fitting iambic.
   
   **4.2. Classify the meter:**
   - The varying stress patterns correspond to the trochaic meter (<t>).

### 5. **Rhythm and Euphony Identification (<RhAnalysis>):**
**5.1. Utilize findings from <MAAnalysis>:**
   - The repeating pattern across clauses showcases rhythm.
   
**5.2. Classify rhythm and euphony:**
   - Due to the balanced, flowing structure, it's classified as rhythmic and balanced (<RB>).

### 6. **Function of the Sentence Identification (<SentType>):**
**6.1. Determine function:**
   - The sentence begins with a statement and ends with a questioning clause, making it a combination but focusing on the predominant function towards the end.
   - Thus, it is identified as a question (<Q>).

### Comprehensive Full_Sent Analysis:

- **Clause and Sentence Type:** Compound Sentence (<C>)
- **Sentence Opener:** Direct statement (<D>)
- **Rhetorical Type:** Antithetical (<A>)
- **Rhetorical Meter:** Trochaic (<t>)
- **Rhythm and Euphony:** Rhythmic and balanced (<RB>)
- **Function:** Question (<Q>)

So, after full analysis:

- **Clause and Sentence Type:** Compound Sentence (<C>)
- **Sentence Opener:** Direct statement (<D>)
- **Rhetorical Type:** Antithetical (<A>)
- **Rhetorical Meter:** Trochaic (<t>)
- **Rhythmic and Euphony:** Rhythmic and balanced (<RB>)
- **Function:** Question (<Q>)
