### Assessing the Defectiveness of the Generalization

**Statement**: "You must avoid medical doctors when ill because otherwise you will become lazy."

First, let's evaluate the defectiveness of this generalization using the criteria established:

- **Score**: 95/100
  - **Reasoning**: This statement is highly defective because it makes a sweeping and unsupported generalization that visiting a medical doctor when ill will invariably lead to laziness. Not only does it fail to consider the myriad reasons people seek medical attention, but it also attributes a complex behavior (laziness) to a simplistic cause without any supportive evidence. The generalization is both misleading and potentially harmful, discouraging people from seeking necessary medical care.

### Identifying Sub-actions in the Given Statement

#### Main Action: Avoiding Medical Doctors When Ill

**Step-by-Step Identification of Sub-actions:**

1. **Identify Symptoms**:
   - Self-diagnose the symptoms you are experiencing.
   - Determine if the symptoms are severe or require professional medical attention.

2. **Research Home Remedies**:
   - Look up potential home remedies for the symptoms identified.
   - Choose remedies that seem appropriate and safe based on your research.

3. **Prepare Home Remedies**:
   - Gather ingredients or materials needed for home remedies.
   - Follow instructions to prepare and apply the home remedies.

4. **Monitor Condition**:
   - Keep track of any changes in symptoms.
   - Evaluate the effectiveness of home remedies continuously.

5. **Self-Care Practices**:
   - Ensure adequate rest and hydration.
   - Maintain a balanced diet to support recovery.
   - Avoid activities that could worsen the condition.

6. **Seek Alternative Treatments (if necessary)**:
   - Research alternative medicine options if home remedies are ineffective.
   - Consider visiting alternative health practitioners like herbalists or acupuncturists if symptoms persist.

7. **Adjust Lifestyle to Prevent Laziness**:
   - Maintain a routine that includes physical activity and other productive habits.
   - Set specific goals to stay active and avoid becoming sedentary.

8. **Evaluate Recovery Progress**:
   - Continuously assess whether symptoms are improving or worsening.
   - Make a decision to visit a medical professional if the condition deteriorates despite other efforts.

### Integration of the Defective Generalization into Sub-actions

Given the context of avoiding medical doctors due to the belief it may cause laziness, some sub-actions reflect this faulty generalization:

1. **Identify Symptoms**:
   - Sub-action involves assessing symptoms without professional input, potentially leading to misdiagnosis.

2. **Research Home Remedies**:
   - This sub-action relies on potentially unreliable sources or incomplete information about effective treatments.

3. **Prepare Home Remedies**:
   - Self-preparation may lack the efficacy and safety of professionally recommended treatments.

4. **Monitor Condition**:
   - The risk here is underestimating the severity of symptoms, leading to delayed professional care.

5. **Self-Care Practices**:
   - While generally positive, this step may overlook the need for professional intervention.
Stupidity is the mother and matter of all evils. She gives birth to boundless desires. Furthermore, boundless desires have neither end nor limit. They breed avarice. Avarice, further, drives men to any crime you will. Thus it is avarice which has led our adversaries to take this crime upon themselves..
