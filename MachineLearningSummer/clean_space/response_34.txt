For 
Let’s apply the task <Full_Sent> to the string 'It would have been much more decorous to keep silent and let persons talk who have read Cooper.'

### Decomposition of Full_Sent

1. **<IDAnalysis>**: Identify the clauses and sentence type.
   - Step 1.1: Determine if the sentence is <S>, <C>, <CC>, or <CXC>.
   - Step 1.2: Identify and count the independent and dependent clauses in the sentence.
   - Step 1.3: Confirm the identified sentence type based on the clauses.

2. **<OAnalysis>**: Identify the type of opening in the sentence.
   - Step 2.1: Check if the sentence opener is a transitional word or phrase (T).
   - Step 2.2: Check if the sentence opener is a direct statement (D).
   - Step 2.3: Check if the sentence opener is a clause opener (C).
   - Step 2.4: Check if the sentence opener is a question (Q).

3. **<RTAnalysis>**: Identify the rhetorical type of the sentence.
   - Step 3.1: Determine if the sentence is loose (L).
   - Step 3.2: Determine if the sentence is periodic (P).
   - Step 3.3: Determine if the sentence is balanced (B).
   - Step 3.4: Determine if the sentence is antithetical (A).

4. **<RhAnalysis>**: Identify the rhythm and euphony of the sentence using <MAAnalysis>.
   - Step 4.1: Apply <MAAnalysis> to identify the rhetorical meter.
       - Step 4.1.1: Identify if the meter is <i>, <t>, <a>, <d>, or <sp>.
   - Step 4.2: Classify the rhythm and euphony as:
       - Step 4.2.1: Smooth and flowing (SM).
       - Step 4.2.2: Rhythmic and balanced (RB).
       - Step 4.2.3: Complex and varied (CV).
       - Step 4.2.4: Jerky or abrupt (JA).

5. **<SentType>**: Identify the function of the sentence.
   - Step 5.1: Determine if the sentence is a statement (S).
   - Step 5.2: Determine if the sentence is a question (Q).
   - Step 5.3: Determine if the sentence is a command (C).
   - Step 5.4: Determine if the sentence is an exclamation (E).

### Application

1. **<IDAnalysis>**:
   - Step 1.1: Determine if the sentence is <S>, <C>, <CC>, or <CXC>.
     - The sentence appears to be a complex sentence because it contains at least two sets of subjects and verbs:
       - Independent clause: "It would have been much more decorous to keep silent and let persons talk"
       - Dependent clause: "who have read Cooper"
       - The sentence does not strictly fit into <C> or <CXC>, it's likely a <CC>.
   
   - Step 1.2: Identify and count the independent and dependent clauses in the sentence:
     - Independent clause: "It would have been much more decorous to keep silent and let persons talk"
     - Dependent clause: "who have read Cooper"
   
   - Step 1.3: Confirm the identified sentence type based on the clauses.
     - The sentence is best identified as a **complex sentence** <CC>.

2. **<OAnalysis>**:
   - Step 2.1: Check if the sentence opener is a transitional word or phrase (T).
     - No transitional word or phrase identified.
   - Step 2.2: Check if the sentence opener is a direct statement (D).
     - The sentence begins with a direct statement: "It would have been much more decorous" -> **(D)**.
   - Step 2.3: Check if the sentence opener is a clause opener (C).
     - No clause opener identified.
   - Step 2.4: Check if the sentence opener is a question (Q).
     - The opener is not a question.

   - The sentence opener is a direct statement **(D)**.

3. **<RTAnalysis>**:
   - Step 3.1: Determine if the sentence is loose (L).
     - The sentence does not follow the loose structure of main clause plus parallel dependent clauses or phrases.
   - Step 3.2: Determine if the sentence is periodic (P).
     - Not a periodic sentence either.
   - Step 3.3: Determine if the sentence is balanced (B).
     - The clauses do balance each other by structure and meaning:
       - "to keep silent" and "let persons talk" balance each other.
       - The sentence is balanced **(B)**.
   - Step 3.4: Determine if the sentence is antithetical (A).
     - No juxtaposition of opposing ideas identified.

   - The rhetorical type is balanced **(B)**.

4. **<RhAnalysis>**:
   - Step 4.1: Apply <MAAnalysis> to identify the rhetorical meter:
     - Subtask 4.1.1: Identify rhetorical meter in clauses:
       - Independent clause: "It would have been much more decorous to keep silent and let persons talk" is mostly unstressed->stressed <t>.
       - Dependent clause: "who have read Cooper" is again mostly unstressed -> stressed <t>.
   - Step 4.2: Classify rhythm and euphony:
     - Given the balanced rhetorical structure, the overall rhythm can be classified as Rhythmic and Balanced **(RB)**.

5. **<SentType>**:
   - Step 5.1: Determine if the sentence is a statement -> **(S)**.

### Conclusion

Applying <Full_Sent> to 'It would have been much more decorous to keep silent and let persons talk who have read Cooper.' results in:

- Sentence Type: **<CC>**
- Opening: **<D>**
- Rhetorical Type: **<B>**
- Rhythm and Euphony: **<RB>**
- Function: **<S>**

This comprehensive analysis shows that the sentence is a complex sentence with a direct statement opening, a balanced rhetorical type, rhythmic and balanced euphony, and serves as a statement.
