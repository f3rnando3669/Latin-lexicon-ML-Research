### Full Sentence Analysis (<Full_Sent>)

Given sentence (<s>): "But as the Deerslayer tale is not a tale, and accomplishes nothing and arrives nowhere, the episodes have no rightful place in the work, since there was nothing for them to develop."

Let's apply <Full_Sent> step-by-step:

#### 1. Clause and Sentence Type Analysis (<IDAnalysis>)
1.1 **Identify independent and dependent clauses**:
   - Independent Clauses:
     - "the Deerslayer tale is not a tale"
     - "accomplishes nothing and arrives nowhere"
     - "the episodes have no rightful place in the work"
   - Dependent Clauses:
     - "But as the Deerslayer tale is not a tale"
     - "since there was nothing for them to develop"
1.2 **Classify the sentence type**:
   - This sentence includes three independent clauses and two dependent clauses.
   - Sentence Type: Complex-Compound (<CXC>)

#### 2. Opener Identification (<OAnalysis>)
2.1 **Determine if the sentence opener fits into one of the categories**:
   - Opener: "But as the Deerslayer tale is not a tale"
   - Type: Clause Opener (<C>)

#### 3. Rhetorical Type Identification (<RTAnalysis>)
3.1 **Check if the sentence fits into one of the rhetorical types**:
   - Structure: The sentence opens with a dependent clause, followed by an independent clause, another independent clause linked by "and", and ending with a dependent clause.
   - Type: Periodic (<P>)

#### 4. Rhetorical Meter Analysis (<MAAnalysis>)
4.1 **Identify the type of rhetorical meter**:
   - Breakdown: 
     - "But" (unstressed)
     - "as the" (unstressed-stressed)
     - "Deerslayer" (stressed-unstressed-stressed)
     - "tale" (stressed)
     - "is not a" (stressed-unstressed-unstressed)
     - "tale" (stressed)
     - "and" (unstressed)
     - "accomplishes" (unstressed-stressed-unstressed-stressed)
     - "nothing" (stressed-unstressed)
     - "and" (unstressed)
     - "arrives" (unstressed-stressed)

     - "rightful" (stressed-unstressed)
     - "place in the work" (stressed-unstressed-unstressed) 
     - "since there" (unstressed-stressed)
     - "was nothing" (unstressed-stressed) for them to develop" (stressed-unstressed-unstressed-stressed)
   - Meter: The sentence is predominately composed of mixed meters, including anapestic and iambic patterns.

#### 5. Rhythm and Euphony Analysis (<RhAnalysis>) using <MAAnalysis>
5.1 **Assess the rhythm and euphony of the sentence**:
   - Mixed meter with frequent use of stressed and unstressed syllables.
   - Class: Complex and Varied (<CV>)

#### 6. Sentence Function Identification (<SentType>)
6.1 **Determine the function of the sentence**:
   - Function: Statement (<S>)

### Full Analysis Result:
- **Clause and Sentence Type**: Complex-Compound (<CXC>).
- **Opener**: Clause Opener (<C>).
- **Rhetorical Type**: Periodic (<P>).
- **Rhetorical Meter**: Predominately mixed meter, including anapestic and iambic patterns.
- **Rhythm and Euphony**: Complex and Varied (<CV>).
- **Sentence Function**: Statement (<S>).
