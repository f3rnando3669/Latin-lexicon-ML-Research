For 
Certainly, let's apply the <Full_Sent> analysis to the sentence: "For man also knoweth not his time: as the fishes that are taken in an evil net, and as the birds that are caught in the snare; so are the sons of men snared in an evil time, when it falleth suddenly upon them."

### Step 1: IDAnalysis

**Identify Clauses**:
- Independent Clauses:
  1. "For man also knoweth not his time"
  2. "so are the sons of men snared in an evil time"
- Dependent Clauses:
  1. "as the fishes that are taken in an evil net"
  2. "as the birds that are caught in the snare"
  3. "when it falleth suddenly upon them"

**Classify Sentence**:
- Contains multiple independent clauses and multiple dependent clauses.
- Sentence Type: <CXC> (compound-complex)

### Step 2: OAnalysis

**Identify Opener Type**:
- The sentence starts with "For," which is a coordinating conjunction often used as a transitional word.
- Opener Type: <T> (transitional word)

### Step 3: RTAnalysis

**Identify Rhetorical Structure**:
- The sentence follows a periodic structure where several dependent clauses precede the main clause.
- Rhetorical Type: <P> (periodic)

### Step 4: RhAnalysis

**Conduct MAAnalysis**:
- Let's break down parts of the sentence by syllabic patterns hypothetically:
  - "For man also knoweth not his time" could be analyzed for its metrical patterns, likely in an iambic rhythm.
  - "as the fishes that are taken in an evil net" can be split for meter analysis.
  - "and as the birds that are caught in the snare" follows this with parallel structure.
  - "so are the sons of men snared in an evil time" again, another clause for meter analysis.
  - "when it falleth suddenly upon them" is another dependent clause.

**Classify Rhythm and Euphony**:
- Given the parallelism and use of dependent clauses to build up to the main thought, it includes rhythmic balance and complexity.
- Rhythm & Euphony: <CV> (complex and varied)

### Step 5: SentType

**Classify Sentence Function**:
- The sentence provides a general observation or statement about human life.
- Function: <S> (statement)

### Full Analysis Result:

- **Sentence Type**: <CXC>
- **Opener**: <T>
- **Rhetorical Type**: <P>
- **Rhythm & Euphony**: <CV>
- **Function**: <S>

**Final Comprehensive Analysis:**

The given sentence "For man also knoweth not his time: as the fishes that are taken in an evil net, and as the birds that are caught in the snare; so are the sons of men snared in an evil time, when it falleth suddenly upon them" is a **compound-complex** sentence (<CXC>) that opens with a **transitional word** (<T>), has a **periodic rhetorical structure** (<P>), is **complex and varied** in terms of euphony (<CV>), and serves as a **statement** (<S>).
