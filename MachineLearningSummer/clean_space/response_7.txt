Sure, let's analyze the string "Now there was found in it a poor wise man, and he by his wisdom delivered the city; yet no man remembered that same poor man." using the detailed breakdown from <Full_Sent>.

### Full_Sent Analysis Process

#### Step 1: IDAnalysis
1.1 **Identify independent clauses**:
- Independent Clause 1: "there was found in it a poor wise man"
- Independent Clause 2: "he by his wisdom delivered the city"
- Independent Clause 3: "no man remembered that same poor man"

1.2 **Identify dependent clauses**:
- None

1.3 **Determine sentence type**:
- <CXC> (complex compound sentence with three independent clauses)

#### Step 2: OAnalysis
2.1 **Identify type of sentence opener**:
- "Now" is a transitional word.

2.2 **Classify the opener**:
- <T> (Transitional opener)

#### Step 3: RTAnalysis
3.1 **Check for Loose (<L>) structure**:
- Main clause + Parallel Dependent clauses or phrases: Not Applicable

3.2 **Check for Periodic (<P>) structure**:
- Parallel Dependent clauses or phrases + Main clause: Not Applicable

3.3 **Check for Balanced (<B>) structure**:
- Phrases or clauses balance each other: Yes, "he by his wisdom delivered the city; yet no man remembered that same poor man."

3.4 **Check for Antithetical (<A>) structure**:
- Two opposing ideas or meanings: Yes, "he by his wisdom delivered the city; yet no man remembered that same poor man."

#### Step 4: MAAnalysis
4.1 **Segment the sentence into syllables**:
- "Now there was found in it a poor wise man, and he by his wisdom delivered the city; yet no man remembered that same poor man."

4.2 **Classify the pattern of stressed and unstressed syllables**:
- We'll break it into chunks for easier analysis. Since this is an advanced task requiring detailed phonetic knowledge, let's approximate:
  - Now there / was found / in it / a poor wise man,
  - and he / by his / wisdom / delivered the city;
  - yet no / man re-membered / that same / poor man.

4.3 **Identify as <i>, <t>, <a>, <d>, or <sp>**:
- The sentence predominantly uses a mix of patterns. The detailed breakdown would involve phonetic transcription, but let's simplify:
  - Now (i) there (t*) / was (i) found(t*) / in (i) it (t) / a poor (t) wise (t) man (d),
  - and he (t) by (t) his (t*) wisdom (d)
  - delivered(t...) / the city (sp);
  - yet(t) no(t*) / man(i) re-membered(sp)
  - that (i) same (sp) / poor (t) man(i)
  
We'll summarize that it follows a varied pattern.

#### Step 5: RhAnalysis
5.1 **Apply MAAnalysis to determine syllabic pattern**:
- Refer to earlier steps.

5.2 **Determine if rhythm is smooth and flowing (<SM>)**:
- No, it's more complex and varied.

5.3 **Determine if rhythm is rhythmic and balanced (<RB>)**:
- Yes, particularly the clause "he by his wisdom delivered the city" juxtaposed against "yet no man remembered that same poor man."

5.4 **Determine if rhythm is complex and varied (<CV>)**:
- Yes, because it combines different rhythmic patterns and clauses.

5.5 **Determine if rhythm is jerky or abrupt (<JA>)**:
- No, the sentence flows smoothly despite its complexity.

#### Step 6: SentType
6.1 **Determine if sentence is a statement (<S>)**:
- Yes

6.2 **Determine if sentence is a question (<Q>)**:
- No

6.3 **Determine if sentence is a command (<C>)**:
- No

6.4 **Determine if sentence is an exclamation (<E>)**:
- No

### Summary of Analysis
- **IDAnalysis**: <CXC> (Complex Compound Sentence)
- **OAnalysis**: <T> (Transitional Opener)
- **RTAnalysis**: <B>, <A> (Balanced, Antithetical)
- **MAAnalysis**: Mixed patterns including <i>, <t>, <a>, <d>, <sp>
- **RhAnalysis**: <RB>, <CV> (Rhythmic and Balanced, Complex and Varied)
- **SentType**: <S> (Statement)

In conclusion, the sentence "Now there was found in it a poor wise man, and he by his wisdom delivered the city; yet no man remembered that same poor man." is a complex compound statement with a transitional opener, employing balanced and antithetical rhetorical types, varied meter patterns, and has a rhythmic and varied euphony.
