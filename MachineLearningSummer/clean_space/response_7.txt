Sure, let's apply the idea of generalization to the statement "Anything you can put in your mouth is good for you" under the framework provided. Applying Action <A> (sub-action breakdown) to evaluate the generalization in this statement, we will analyze and describe its defectiveness.

1. **Identify the core claim in the statement**:
   - Description: "Anything you can put in your mouth is good for you" is a sweeping generalization suggesting that all ingestible items are beneficial.

2. **Evaluate a specific case**:
   - Description: Consider specific items one might put in their mouth (e.g., nutritious food vs. harmful substances like poison or certain non-food objects).
   - **Defectiveness Insight**: The statement already starts to falter as it does not discriminate between what is beneficial (like fruits, vegetables) and what is harmful (like toxic substances).

3. **Assess the truth based on specific instances**:
   - Description: Compare several specific instances (apple, piece of plastic, toxic chemicals) against the general claim.
   - **Defectiveness Score**: This step highlights the falsehood of the general claim because examples exist that contradict it.
   - **Score**: 98/100 (highly defective due to blatant disregard for harmful substances)

4. **Form an organizing committee to scrutinize the generality**:
   - Description: Hypothetically, gather experts in nutrition, toxicology, and medicine to evaluate the statement.
   - **Defectiveness Insight**: Experts would unanimously refute the claim as absurd and dangerous, pointing out real harm from certain substances.

5. **Decide on a framework for analysis**:
   - Description: Use scientific criteria for what is 'good for you'. This would involve nutrition standards, toxicity levels, etc.
   - **Defectiveness Insight**: This structured analysis would further expose the defectiveness of the general statement.

6. **Create a criteria matrix for evaluation**:
   - Description: Develop a detailed criteria matrix to assess safety and nutritional value of ingestible items.
   - **Defectiveness Insight**: Clearly shows a multitude of exceptions, reinforcing the high defectiveness of the original statement.

7. **Plan the method of dissemination of findings**:
   - Description: Outline how you would communicate these findings (through public health advisories, educational materials, etc.)
   - **Defectiveness Insight**: Necessary to counteract potential harm caused by such a sweeping and incorrect generalization.

8. **Promote critical perspectives on the generalization**:
   - Description: Use various platforms to debunk the myth.
   - **Defectiveness Insight**: Essential to prevent misinformation from being accepted as truth.

9. **Gather feedback from knowledgeable sources**:
   - Description: Solicit opinions from healthcare professionals and knowledgeable parties about the statement.
   - **Defectiveness Insight**: Ensures a comprehensive rebuttal, typically confirming the original statement's defectiveness.

10. **Reflect on the implications of spreading such generalizations**:
    - Description: Consider the health implications and broader societal impact of spreading false generalized claims.
    - **Defectiveness Insight**: Draws attention to the potential dangers, solidifying the rationale for high defectiveness scoring.

Final **Defectiveness Score for "Anything you can put in your mouth is good for you"**:
- **Score**: 98/100

The generalization is extremely defective as it fails to account for the harmful nature of numerous substances, thereby presenting a dangerously misleading claim. This analysis emphasizes the need for nuanced understanding and careful consideration of individual instances rather than broad, unfounded generalizations.
