The Various Sentence Structures will be defined as follows:

\<S> is a simple sentence that is comprised of one independent clause.
<C> is a compound sentence that is comprised of two independent clauses and no dependpent clauses.
<CC> is a complex sentence that is comprised of only one independent clause and at least one dependent clause.
<CXC> is a complex compound sentence that is comprised of at least two independent clauses and at least one dependent clause.

<L> is a loose rhetorical type that follows the formula: Main clause + Parallel Dependent clauses or phrases
<P> is a periodic rhetorical type that follows the formula: Parallel Dependent clauses or phrases + Main clause
<B> is a balanced rhetorical type that the phrases or clauses balance each other by virtue of their likeness of structure, meaning, or length: e.g., “He maketh me lie down in green pastures; he leadeth me beside still waters.”
<A> is an antithetical rhetoric type where two oposing ideas or meanings are juxtaposed, usually two independent clauses seperated by a comma or a semicolon: e.g., "Hope for the best, prepare for the worst."

<T> is a sentence opener where the opener is a transitional word or phrase.(e.g., True, But, Another)
<D> is a sentence opener where the opener is a direct statement.(e.g., The critical power, It is undeniable)
<C> is a setence opener where the opener is a clause opener. (e.g., In that case)
<Q> is a setence opener where the opener is a question. (e.g., What if)

A Note to those reading, no strict classifier was found for the following definitions, so I have taken the liberty to give quantifiable characteristics to the best of my ability.

<i> is a type of rhetorical meter where it is comprised of two syllables where the first is stressed, while the following syllable is unstressed.
<t> is a type of rhetorical meter where it is comprised of two syllables where the first is unstressed, while the following syllable is stressed.
<a> is a type of rhetorical meter where it is comprised of three syllables where the first two are stressed, while the last syllable is unstressed.
<d> is a type of rhetorical meter where it is comprised of three syllables where where the first syllable is unstressed, while the second and third are stressed.
<sp> is a type of rhetorical meter where it is comprised of two syllables where both syllables are unstressed.

<SM> is a rythmic and euphony where the setence is "Smooth and flowing" defined by maintaining a consistent rhythm and cadence. This can be achieved through the use of regular meter, such as iambic or trochaic patterns, where syllables are stressed and unstressed in a predictable manner. 
<RB> is a rythmic and euphony where the setence is "Rhythmic and balanced" defined through the use of parallel structure, repetition, and symmetrical phrasing, often seen in antithetical or balanced rhetorical types.
<CV> is a rythmic and euphony where the setence is "Complex and varied" defined by intricate arrangements of clauses and phrases, incorporating a mix of different rhythmic patterns and varying sentence lengths. This type of sentence often includes multiple dependent and independent clauses, creating a rich and layered effect.
<JA> is a rythmic and euphony where the setence is "Jerky or abrupt" defined by irregular, choppy rhythms and abrupt shifts in thought or structure. This type of sentence often uses short, disjointed clauses or phrases that disrupt the flow and create a sense of unease or urgency.

\<S> is a statement.
<Q> is a question.
<C> is a command.
<E> is an exclamation.

Toward the end of these experiments, the main issue in the model being made was the rhythm of the sentences. To combat this, we have selected a new source to obtain a new possible metric that would still be insightful to the purpose of a sentence without the need to explain how to quantify rhythm, which is something that can't really be quantified. In this pursuit where we lie at 8/5/2024 is the idea that ancient latinate words have more of a tendency to be balanced and rhythmic. Using this in tandem with the existing rhythm parameters, we are hoping for better results in analysis of sentences.
