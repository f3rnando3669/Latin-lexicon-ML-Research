Only money can make people do heinous things.

Anything you can put in your mouth is good for you.

You must avoid medical doctors when ill because otherwise you will become lazy.

No one can graduate from university before the age of 19. 

One must avoid the sun because it is far away from us.

People only die of old age or illness.

The goddess Fortune is blind and stupid.
She is blind, for that she fails wholly to perceive whereto she attaches herself.
She is stupid because she knows not how to tell worthy from unworthy.

Stupidity is the mother and matter of all evils. She gives birth to boundless desires. Furthermore, boundless desires have neither end nor limit. They breed avarice. Avarice, further, drives men to any crime you will. Thus it is avarice which has led our adversaries to take this crime upon themselves.

in our wretched life there any such thing as Fortune; there is, they say, Blind Accident. That this is more like the truth, is proved by the actual experience of life; even as Orestes now was king, and now became a beggar.
