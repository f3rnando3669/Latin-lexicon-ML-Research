Passage Analysis:
1."Now therefore I went on in sin with great greediness of mind, still grudging
that I could not be so satisfied with it as I would."(C-T-...-...-ST)
2."This did continue with me
about a month or more; but one day, as I was standing at a neighbor's shop-
window, and there cursing and swearing and playing the madman, after
my wonted manner, there sat within the woman of the house, and heard me,
who, though she was a very loose and very ungodly wench, yet protested that I
swore and cursed at that most fearful rate that she was made to tremble to
hear me; and told me further that I was the ungodliest fellow for swearing
that ever she heard in all her life; and that I, by thus doing, was able to
spoil all the youth in the whole town, if they came but in my company."
3."At this reproof I was silenced and put to secret shame, and that too, as I
thought, before the God of heaven; wherefore, while I stood there, and
hanging down my head, I wished with all my heart that I might be a little
child again, that my father might learn me to speak without this wicked
way of swearing; for, thought I, I am so accustomed to it that it is in vain
for me to think of a reformation, for I thought it could never be."
4."But how it came to pass, I know not; I did from this time forward so
leave my swearing that it was a great wonder to myself to observe it; and 
whereas before, I knew not how to speak unless I put an oath before and
another behind, to make my words have authority, now I could, without it,
speak better, and with more pleasantness, than I ever could before."
5."All this
while I knew not Jesus Christ, neither did I leave my sports and play."(CC-C-...-...-ST)
