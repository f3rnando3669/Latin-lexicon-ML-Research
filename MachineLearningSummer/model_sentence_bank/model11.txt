model 11: 'Tis a vanity common to all writers, to overvalue their own productions; and
'tis better for me to own this failing in myself, than the world to do it for
me. For what other reason have I spent my life in so unprofitable a study?
Why am I grown old in seeking so barren a reward as fame? The same parts
and application which have made me a poet might have raised me to any
honours of the gown, which are often given to men of as little learning and
less honesty than myself. No Government has ever been, or ever can be,
wherein time-servers and blockheads will not be uppermost. The persons
are only changed, but the same jugglings in State, the same hypocrisy in
religion, the same self-interest and mismanagement, will remain for ever.
Blood and money will be lavished in all ages, only for the preferment of
new faces, with old consciences. There is too often a jaundice in the eyes of
great men; they see not those whom they raise in the same colors with other
men. All whom they affect look golden to them, when the gilding is only in
their own distempered sight. These considerations have given me a kind of
contempt for those who have risen by unworthy ways, I am not ashamed to
be little, when I see them so infamously great; neither do I know why the
name of a poet should be dishonourable to me; if I am truly one, as I hope I
am; for I will never do anything that shall dishonour it.
-John Dryden From the Dedication to Examen Poeticum, 1693
