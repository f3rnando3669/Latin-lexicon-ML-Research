model 10: I know very well that many, who pretend to be wise by the forms of being
grave, are apt to despise both poetry and music as toys and trifles too light
for the use or entertainment of serious men. But whoever find themselves
wholly insensitive to these charms would, I think, do well to keep their own
counsel, for fear of reproaching their own temper, and bringing the goodness
of their natures, if not their understandings, into question. It may
be thought as least an ill sign, if not an ill constitution, since some of the
Fathers went so far as to esteem the love of music as a sign of predestination,
as a thing divine, and reserved for the felicities of Heaven itself. While this
world lasts, I doubt not but the pleasure and request of these two entertainments
will do so too; and happy those that content themselves with these or
any other so easy and innocent, and do not trouble the world or other
men, because they do cannot quiet themselves, though nobody hurts them.
When all is done, human life is, at the greatest and the best, but like a   
forward child, that must be played with and humoured a little to keep it
quiet till it falls asleep, and then the care is over.
-Sir William Temple from Of Poetry, 1690
