model 4: The critical power is of lower rank than the creative. True; but in assenting to
this proposition, one or two things are to be kept in mind. It is undeniable that the
exercise of a creative power, that a free creative activity, is the highest function of man;
it is so by man's finding in it his true happiness. But it is undeniable, also, that men may
have the sense of exercising this free creative activity in other ways than in pro- ducing
great works of literature or art; if it were not so, all but a very few men would be shut out
from the true happiness of all men. They may have it in well-doing, they may have it in
learning, they may have it even in criticising. This is one thing to be kept in mind.
Another is that the exercise of the creative power in the production of great works of
literature or art, however high this exercise of it may rank, is not at all epochs and under
all conditions possible; and that therefore labour may be vainly spent in attempting it,
which might with more fruit be used in preparing for it, in rendering it possible. This
creative power works with elements, with materials; what if it has not those materials,
those elements, ready for its use? In that case, it must surely wait till they art ready. -
