model 12: I must confess myself to have been very much dejected just before this happened;
for the prodigious number that were taken sick the week or two
before, besides those that dies, was such, and the lamentations were so great
everywhere, that a man must have seemed to have acted even against his
reason if he had so much as expected to escape; and as there was hardly a
house but mine in all my neighborhood but what was infected, so had it
gone on it would not have been long that there would have been any more
neighbors to be infected. Indeed it is hardly credible what dreadful havoc
the last three week had made, for if I might believe the person whose calculations
I always found well grounded, there were not less than 30,000
people dead and near 100,000 fallen sick in the three weeks I speak of; for
the number that sickened was surprising; indeed it was astonishing, and
those whose courage upheld them all the time before, sank under it now.
In the middle of their distress, when the condition of the City of London
was so truly calamitous, just then it pleased God, as it were, by His immediate
hand to disarm the enemy; the poison was taken out of the sting. It
was wonderful; even the physicians themselves were surprised at it. Wherever
they visited they found thier patients better; either they had sweated
kindly, or the tumors were broke, or the carbuncles went down, and the inflammations
round them changed color, or the fever was gone, or the violent
headache was assuaged, or some good symptom was the case; so that in a
few days everybody was recovering, whole families that were infected and
down, that had ministers praying with them, and expected death every hour,
were revived and healed, and none died at all out of them.
-Daniel Defoe From A Journal of the Plague Year, 1722
