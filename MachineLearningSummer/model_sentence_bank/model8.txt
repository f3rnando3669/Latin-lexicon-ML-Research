model 8: If the nearness of the last necessity brought a nearer conformity into it, there
were a happiness in hoary hairs, and no calamity in half-senses. But the long
habit of living indisposeth us for dying; when avarice makes us the spot of
death, when even David grew politicly cruel, Solomon could hardly be 
said to be the wisest of men. But many are too early old, and before the date
of age. Adversity stretcheth our days, misery makes Alcmena's nights, and
time hath no wings unto it. But the most tedious being is that which can
unwish itself, content to be nothing, or never to have been, which was beyond
the malcontent of Job, who cursed not the day of his life, but his nativity;
content to have so far been, as to have a title to future being, although he had
lived here but in a hidden state of life, and as it were an abortion.
-Sir Thomas Browne From Hydriotaphia, Urn-Burial, 1658
