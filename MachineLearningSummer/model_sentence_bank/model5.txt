model 5: 
It seems to me that it was far from right for the Professor of English in Yale, the
Professor of English Literature in Columbia, and Wilkie Collins to deliver opinions on
Cooper's literature without having read some of it. It would have been much more
decorous to keep silent and let persons talk who have read Cooper.
Cooper's art has some defects. In one place in Deerslayer, and in the restricted
space of two-thirds of a page, Cooper has scored 114 offenses against literary art out of
a possible 115. It breaks the record. There are nineteen rules governing literary art in
the domain of romantic fiction--some say twenty-two. In Deerslayer Cooper violated
eighteen of them. These eighteen require: That a tale shall accomplishsomething and arrive somewhere. But the Deerslayer tale accomplishesnothing and arrives in the air.
They require that the episodes of a tale shall be necessary parts of the tale and shall help to develop it. But as the Deerslayer tale is not a tale, and accomplishes nothing and arrives nowhere, the episodes have no rightful place in the work, since there was nothing for them to develop.
They require that the personages in a tale shall be alive, except in the case of corpses, and that always the reader shall be able to tell the corpses from the others. 
But this detail has often been overlooked in the Deerslayer tale....
