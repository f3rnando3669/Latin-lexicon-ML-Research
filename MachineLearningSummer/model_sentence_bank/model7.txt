model 7: By this it appears how necessary it is for any man that aspires to true
Knowledge to examine the Definitions of former Authors; and either to
correct them, where they are negligently set down; or to make them himself.
For the errors of Definitions multiply themselves, according as the reckoning
proceeds; and lead men into absurdities, which at last they see, but cannot
avoid, without reckoning anew from the beginning; in which lies the
foundation of their errors. From whence it happens that they which trust to
books do as they that cast up many little sums into a greater, without considering
whether those little sums be rightly cast up or not; and at last
finding the error visible, and not mistrusting their first grounds, know not
which way to clear themselves; but spend time in fluttering over their books;
as birds that entering by a chimmney and finding themselves inclosed in a
chamber flutter at the false light of a glass window, for want of wit to consider
which way they came in. So that in the right Definition of Names lies 
the first use of Speech; which is the acquisition of Science; and in the wrong,
or no Definitions, lies the first abuse, from which proceed all false and senseless
Tenets; which make those men that take their instructions from the authority
of books, and not from their own medication, to be as much below
the condition of ignorant men, as men endued with true Science are above
it. For between true Science and erroneous doctrines, ignorance is in the
middle. Natural sense and imagination are not subjet to absurdity. Nature
itself cannot err, and as men abound in copiousness of language, so they
become more wise or more mad than ordinary
-Thomas Hobbes from Leviathan, Part 1, Chapter 4, 1651
