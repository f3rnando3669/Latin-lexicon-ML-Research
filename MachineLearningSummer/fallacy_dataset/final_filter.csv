There is strong movement from people who choose not to consume meat, and their reasons vary from the healthiness to the effort of making the body looks appropriate or ideal. This is a rather ludicrous idea.
Human beings have been consuming meat since thousands of years and counting. There are no cases when consuming meat causing severe problems, provided meat is consumed in appropriate amount, for everyone. Many say that being a vegan means having a healthier, stronger body and mind. Actualy, according to studies, our bodies are perfectly capable of digesting, absorbing and making full use of the many beneficial nutrients found in animal foods. Thus, there is no health reason to completely avoid animal foods.
Don’t put unnecessary restrain on yourselves. You should enjoy life to the fullest; give your best in any possible situations, as well as consuming meat.

<IR>," Perhaps the most classic example of this fallacy is the argument for the existence of God.  Due to the understanding of nature through science, many of the arguments that used to be used for God (or gods) were abandoned, only to be replaced with new ones, usually involving questions to which science has not definitively answered yet.  The move from creationism to intelligent design is a prime example.  Currently the origin of life is a popular argument for God (although a classic argument from ignorance), and an area where we very well may have a scientific answer in the next decade, at which time, the “origin of life” argument will fade away and be replaced by another, thus moving the figurative goalposts farther back as our understanding of the natural world increases.Exception: This fallacy should not be confused with an argument or set of arguments, with multiple propositions inherent in the argument.  The reason for the difference between this kind of argument and the moving the goalposts fallacy, is a subtle one, but indicated by a strong initial claim (“has to be”, “must”, “required for”, etc.) that gets answered and/or what appears to be ad hoc objections that follow eventually leading to an impossible request for proof.
Fun Fact: The name “moving the goalposts” comes from the analogy of kicking a perfect field goal in American football, only to have the goalposts be moved on you. This would be very unfair.
