For remote_tracing.txt
To evaluate the argument in <SP> against the types of defective arguments listed in <RB>, the following scoring system will be used: a score of 100 indicates that the argument strongly adheres to that defective type, and a score of 0 means it does not.

1. **Generalization**: 70 - The argument makes broad claims about avarice and crime without substantiating that it encompasses all men.
2. **Impossibility**: 0 - The argument does not declare anything as impossible.
3. **Incomplete Enumeration**: 60 - The argument suggests that avarice is the only driver of crime, without considering other motivations.
4. **False Enumeration**: 60 - Similar to Incomplete Enumeration, it narrowly focuses on avarice and ignores other factors.
5. **Remote Tracing**: 50 - Traces the origin of the argument from stupidity to avarice, potentially more elaborate than necessary.
6. **Inappropriate Reason**: 80 - Argues that avarice leads men to crime without strong supporting evidence.
7. **Groundless Reason**: 70 - Claims about avarice causing crime are not properly substantiated.
8. **Redundant Reason**: 30 - There is some redundancy in the steps from boundless desires to avarice, but not egregious.
9. **Weak Causal Basis**: 85 - The causality between avarice and committing crimes isn't strongly justified.
10. **Misapplied Reason**: 0 - The reason here is consistently focused on avarice.
11. **Dilemma Misuse**: 0 - The argument does not present a dilemma.
12. **Misapplication of Signs**: 50 - Suggests universal signs (avarice) indicate a specific outcome (crime), though this is not necessarily true.
13. **Peripheral Disputes**: 0 - Does not argue something that fits the speaker equally.
14. **Banality**: 40 - The mention of avarice leading to crime could be seen as an overused assertion.
15. **False Universals**: 80 - Argues that avarice universally leads to crime without proof.
16. **Belated Arguments**: 30 - Provides key claims up front, though the chain of causation may be considered delayed.
17. **Misleading Defenses**: 60 - The use of avarice as a blanket cause without clear evidence.
18. **Double-Edged Phrases**: 0 - No ambiguous statements that could backfire.
19. **Misleading Definitions**: 70 - Defines avarice too broadly as the cause of crime.
20. **Questionable Statements**: 80 - The linkage of stupidity to avarice and then crime is fraught with unproven assertions.
21. **Inconsistent Reasoning**: 0 - The reasoning is internally consistent, although flawed.
22. **Hostile Addressing**: 20 - Somewhat accuses the audienceâ€™s adversaries without concrete evidence.
23. **Incomplete Proofs**: 90 - Fails to substantiate many of the propositions made.
24. **Topic Shifting**: 0 - Remains focused on the topic of avarice leading to crime.
25. **Fault by Association**: 0 - Does not disparage a field or group by association.
26. **Evidence Mix-Up**: 70 - Proof of misconduct (avarice leading to crime) without identifying the specific perpetrator's culpability.
27. **Biased Comparisons**: 70 - Implies avarice uniformly leads to crime, a potentially biased viewpoint.
28. **Name Disputes**: 0 - No disputes over naming conventions.
29. **Inexact Similes**: 40 - Limited use of comparisons, though it might stretch logical linkages.
30. **Unsupported Examples**: 80 - Many examples and linkages are unsupported.
31. **Misapplied Judgements**: 0 - Does not rely on inappropriate previous judgments.
32. **Unnecessary Establishments**: 60 - Elaborates on points that may already be conceded such as the risk inherent in boundless desires.
33. **Amplification Errors**: 70 - Amplifies points (like avarice) that should be substantiated rigorously.
34. **Incomplete Summaries**: 50 - The argument summary is somewhat broad but still encompasses key parts.

These scores indicate how each type of defective argument manifests in <SP>. Identifying such flaws can help refine and solidify the overall argumentative structure for better clarity and persuasiveness.
