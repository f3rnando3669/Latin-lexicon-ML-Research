Sure! Let's analyze the given text using the framework from <RB> to identify the worst three types of defective arguments, scoring each out of 100 based on their impact and severity.

### 1. Misleading Defenses (Score: 90/100)
- **Identification**: The narrative in <SP> tries to mitigate the concept of "Fortune" by asserting that it is more accurately described as "Blind Accident."
- **Explanation**: This defense is misleading because it oversimplifies the complex concept of Fortune. It tries to defend a weak argument by shifting the lexicon without a substantial basis.
- **Impact**: This is highly misleading as it can lead people to dismiss valuable insights about chance and causality in life.

### 2. False Universals (Score: 85/100)
- **Identification**: The statement "even as Orestes now was king, and now became a beggar" implies a universal truth about the unpredictability of Fortune.
- **Explanation**: This is a fallacy because it generalizes the specific case of Orestes to a universal principle about the nature of life and Fortune.
- **Impact**: It can heavily distort one's understanding of life by making them believe that such drastic changes are common and inevitable for everyone.

### 3. Groundless Reason (Score: 80/100)
- **Identification**: The assertion that "Blind Accident" being the truth is "proved by the actual experience of life" is unsupported.
- **Explanation**: The statement provides no empirical or logical reasoning to substantiate the claim that Blind Accident is more accurate than Fortune.
- **Impact**: It weakens the argument by relying on an assumption that isn't backed by any strong evidence or reasoning, making it less credible.

### Summary:
1. **Misleading Defenses** (90/100) - Severely mischaracterizes concepts, leading to potential misunderstanding.
2. **False Universals** (85/100) - Overgeneralizes from specific instances, misleading about the nature of lifeâ€™s unpredictability.
3. **Groundless Reason** (80/100) - Bases arguments on unsubstantiated claims, reducing credibility and strength of the argument. 

By recognizing these fallacies and their impacts, one can better comprehend and critique the arguments within <SP>.
