Based on **"Rhetorica ad Herennium"** by Cicero, I will score the statement "You must avoid medical doctors when ill because otherwise you will become lazy" against each type of defective argument. The scoring will reflect how well the statement aligns with each defect, with a score of 1 indicating a strong presence of the defect and 0 indicating its absence.

1. **Generalization**: 0 (The statement does not generalize from a specific instance about doctors in general.)
2. **Impossibility**: 0 (The claim is not stating an occurrence as impossible.)
3. **Incomplete Enumeration**: 0 (There is no incomplete list of possibilities.)
4. **False Enumeration**: 0 (It doesn't enumerate a list of motives or causes.)
5. **Remote Tracing**: 0 (The argument isn't tracing the origin of a cause too far back.)
6. **Inappropriate Reason**: 1 (The reason provided for avoiding doctors is illogical and unrelated to the proposition of staying healthy.)
7. **Groundless Reason**: 1 (The assertion that seeing doctors leads to laziness lacks evidence and is false.)
8. **Redundant Reason**: 0 (The reason given is not just rephrasing the proposition.)
9. **Weak Causal Basis**: 1 (The causal link between seeing doctors and becoming lazy is weak and unsubstantiated.)
10. **Misapplied Reason**: 0 (The reason is not reused for a different proposition within the statement.)
11. **Dilemma Misuse**: 0 (There isn't a dilemma presented that can be easily reversed.)
12. **Misapplication of Signs**: 1 (It misapplies the idea that seeing doctors has a single and specific negative outcome.)
13. **Peripheral Disputes**: 0 (The statement does not make examples that fit oneself or others as well.)
14. **Banality**: 0 (The statement is not an overused excuse or reason.)
15. **False Universals**: 1 (It falsely assumes a universal truth without proof.)
16. **Belated Arguments**: 0 (The timing of the argument is irrelevant here.)
17. **Misleading Defenses**: 0 (It is not using pretexts to cover evident faults.)
18. **Double-Edged Phrases**: 0 (The statement is not open to dual interpretations.)
19. **Misleading Definitions**: 0 (It does not provide false or overly general definitions.)
20. **Questionable Statements**: 1 (The assertion that doctors cause laziness is unproven and questionable.)
21. **Inconsistent Reasoning**: 0 (There is no internal contradiction in the reasoning.)
22. **Hostile Addressing**: 0 (It doesn't address an audience's beliefs in a hostile manner.)
23. **Incomplete Proofs**: 1 (It fails to substantiate the claim effectively.)
24. **Topic Shifting**: 0 (There's no deviation from the main issue in this short statement.)
25. **Fault by Association**: 0 (It doesn't disparage a field due to the faults of its practitioners.)
26. **Evidence Mix-Up**: 0 (There's no proofing misconduct without identifying the perpetrator.)
27. **Biased Comparisons**: 0 (There aren't unfair or unbalanced comparisons here.)
28. **Name Disputes**: 0 (There is no controversy over naming conventions.)
29. **Inexact Similes**: 0 (There are no comparisons made.)
30. **Unsupported Examples**: 0 (No specific examples are given.)
31. **Misapplied Judgements**: 0 (There are no irrelevant or inappropriate previous judgments referenced.)
32. **Unnecessary Establishments**: 0 (It does not proof something the opponent has conceded.)
33. **Amplification Errors**: 0 (It does not amplify points that should be substantiated.)
34. **Incomplete Summaries**: 0 (There is no attempt to summarize in the statement.)

### Summary of Scores:
- **Inappropriate Reason**: 1
- **Groundless Reason**: 1
- **Weak Causal Basis**: 1
- **Misapplication of Signs**: 1
- **False Universals**: 1
- **Questionable Statements**: 1
- **Incomplete Proofs**: 1

**Total Defective Argument Types Identified**: 7 out of 34

Thus, the statement contains several defective arguments, primarily due to inappropriate and groundless reasoning, weak causal basis, and unproven assertions.
