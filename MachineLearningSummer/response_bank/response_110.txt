Applying the insights from <RB> to the statement in <SP>, here are three defective argument types most prominently exemplified:

1. **Incomplete Enumeration**:
   - **Explanation**: The statement suggests that life's outcomes are solely due to either "Fortune" (interpreted as luck or fate) or "Blind Accident" (interpreted as random chance), ignoring other factors such as individual actions, societal influences, and systemic structures.
   - **Example from <SP>**: "In our wretched life, there any such thing as Fortune; there is, they say, Blind Accident." This divides life into just these two possibilities without considering a broader range of influences.

2. **False Universals**:
   - **Explanation**: The statement uses examples like Orestes becoming a beggar as a proof for the universal truth that fortune or accident dictate all life's outcomes. This ignores the complexity of most individual circumstances and overgeneralizes from specific instances.
   - **Example from <SP>**: "That this is more like the truth, is proved by the actual experience of life; even as Orestes now was king, and now became a beggar." It implies that all life situations can be understood by this one narrative without recognizing the diverse experiences of different people.

3. **Groundless Reason**:
   - **Explanation**: The example of Orestes transitioning from king to beggar is given as definitive proof of the theory without substantial evidence or logical reasoning connecting the specific instance to the broader claim.
   - **Example from <SP>**: "That this is more like the truth, is proved by the actual experience of life; even as Orestes now was king, and now became a beggar." The reasoning provided here is insufficient and does not comprehensively support the overarching claim that life is governed by blind accident or fortune.

These types of defective arguments hinder the strength and validity of the logic in <SP>, making the reasoning appear superficial and lacking robustness.
