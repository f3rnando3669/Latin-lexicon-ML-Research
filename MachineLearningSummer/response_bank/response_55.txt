All right, let's critically analyze the statement "Anything you can put in your mouth is good for you," by comparing it with the outlined defective arguments from the rule book, and then rate how defective the argument is.

1. **Generalization**: 
   - **Rating**: 100
   - **Justification**: The statement makes an absolute generalization that is clearly unsound. It assumes that merely being able to ingest something validates its benefits, blatantly ignoring harmful substances.

2. **Impossibility**:
   - **Rating**: 50
   - **Justification**: This argument is more about the logical possibility of ingesting harmful things, which contradicts the assertion. Although not explicitly declaring impossibility, the statement implies it by exclusion.

3. **Incomplete Enumeration**:
   - **Rating**: 70
   - **Justification**: By claiming that anything ingestible is beneficial, it fails to consider the numerous harmful substances that one can consume (e.g., poisons, toxins).

4. **False Enumeration**:
   - **Rating**: 85
   - **Justification**: The statement could fall under false enumeration as it simplifies the categories of ingestible items to only 'good for you,' ignoring other outcomes like harm or neutral effects.

5. **Inappropriate Reason**:
   - **Rating**: 90
   - **Justification**: The statement provides an underlying rationale ("can put in your mouth") that does not logically support the proposition of being beneficial. 

6. **Groundless Reason**:
   - **Rating**: 85
   - **Justification**: The assumption that if something can fit in your mouth it must be good lacks evidence and support; thus, it is groundless.

7. **Redundant Reason**:
   - **Rating**: 50
   - **Justification**: The argument does not repeat itself but rather makes an unreasonable claim. However, it could be seen as a tautology of "anything ingestible is good because it can be ingested," which isn’t directly present.

8. **Weak Causal Basis**:
   - **Rating**: 90
   - **Justification**: This argument assumes causality—that the capacity to be ingested is a cause for being beneficial—without substantiation.

9. **Misapplied Reason**:
   - **Rating**: 60
   - **Justification**: The reason may not be directly misapplied across different propositions, but it is incorrectly assigned here.

10. **Dilemma Misuse**:
    - **Rating**: 10
    - **Justification**: The argument isn’t presenting a classic dilemma.

11. **Misapplication of Signs**:
    - **Rating**: 100
    - **Justification**: The argument grossly misuses the sign (ingestibility) to indicate health benefits universally.

12. **Peripheral Disputes**:
    - **Rating**: 40
    - **Justification**: This doesn’t directly create a peripheral dispute but oversimplifies the central issue.

13. **Banality**:
    - **Rating**: 30
    - **Justification**: The argument isn’t a well-used excuse but rather a bizarre and easily refutable claim.

14. **False Universals**:
    - **Rating**: 100
    - **Justification**: This is a clear case of asserting a universally agreed point (everything ingested is good) without proof or truth.

15. **Belated Arguments**:
    - **Rating**: 10
    - **Justification**: Timing isn’t the issue here.

16. **Misleading Defenses**:
    - **Rating**: 85
    - **Justification**: If contested, the argument would likely rely on misleading defenses to cover its faults.

17. **Double-Edged Phrases**:
    - **Rating**: 50
    - **Justification**: While the phrase is not double-edged, it is overly simplistic and logically weak.

18. **Misleading Definitions**:
    - **Rating**: 90
    - **Justification**: The definition provided by the statement is misleadingly simplistic and incorrect.

19. **Questionable Statements**:
    - **Rating**: 100
    - **Justification**: The assertion is unproven and easily proven false.

20. **Inconsistent Reasoning**:
    - **Rating**: 70
    - **Justification**: The internal logic is flawed but not self-contradictory; it is instead uniformly absurd.

21. **Hostile Addressing**:
    - **Rating**: 20
    - **Justification**: This argument doesn’t specifically target an audience’s beliefs but rather makes an absurd claim.

22. **Incomplete Proofs**:
    - **Rating**: 50
    - **Justification**: While not incomplete, the proof or reasoning here is fundamentally flawed.

23. **Topic Shifting**:
    - **Rating**: 10
    - **Justification**: The argument doesn’t shift from the topic but rather oversimplifies it.

24. **Fault by Association**:
    - **Rating**: 30
    - **Justification**: The argument doesn’t blame by association but by faulty logic.

25. **Evidence Mix-Up**:
    - **Rating**: 20
    - **Justification**: There isn’t a mix-up of evidence here; simply a lack of valid evidence.

26. **Biased Comparisons**:
    - **Rating**: 40
    - **Justification**: While comparisons are extreme, the primary flaw is the generalization.

27. **Name Disputes**:
    - **Rating**: 10
    - **Justification**: This point is irrelevant to the argument.

28. **Inexact Similes**:
    - **Rating**: 0
    - **Justification**: Similes are not used here.

29. **Unsupported Examples**:
    - **Rating**: 100
    - **Justification**: Any examples likely used for this argument would be inappropriate or false.

30. **Misapplied Judgements**:
    - **Rating**: 50
    - **Justification**: There is no evidence or judgment applied as support.

31. **Unnecessary Establishments**:
    - **Rating**: 30
    - **Justification**: The argument doesn’t propose or establish anything unnecessary; it is inherently false.

32. **Amplification Errors**:
    - **Rating**: 80
    - **Justification**: This inflates a common fact (ingestion) into an untrue universal benefit.

33. **Incomplete Summaries**:
    - **Rating**: 10
    - **Justification**: The conclusion is clear, albeit incorrect.

The overall composite rating would consider the average of these ratings. Calculating the average:

\( \text{Average Defectiveness Rating} = \frac{100 + 50 + 70 + 85 + 90 + 85 + 50 + 90 + 60 + 10 + 100 + 40 + 30 + 100 + 10 + 85 + 50 + 90 + 100 + 70 + 20 + 50 + 10 + 30 + 20 + 40 + 10 + 0 + 100 + 50 + 30 + 80 + 10}{33} \approx 58.79 \)

So,

\[
\boxed{58.79}
\]

Thus, the argument "Anything you can put in your mouth is good for you" is rated approximately 58.79 out of 100 on the defectiveness scale, indicating it is severely flawed across multiple logical standards.
