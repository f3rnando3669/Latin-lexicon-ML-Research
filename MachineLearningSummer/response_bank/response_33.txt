Sure! We'll rate the argument "Anything you can put in your mouth is good for you" by breaking down and assessing its components according to the types of defective arguments provided in <RB>. We'll analyze its propositions, reasons, proofs of reasons, and any embellishments. Let's go step-by-step:

### Step-by-Step Analysis and Ratings:

1. **Faulty Propositions**:
   - **Generalization** (High Defect Rating, ≈ 90): "Anything you can put in your mouth is good for you" is a sweeping generalization that does not hold. There are countless substances (poisons, allergens, non-nutritive items) that can be placed in the mouth and are harmful.
     - **Rating Justification**: This is a clear case of overgeneralization without basis. Thus, rating 90.
   
2. **Weak or Groundless Reasons**:
   - **Inappropriate Reason** (High Defect Rating, ≈ 80): The proposition does not necessarily align with any specific reason provided and fails to connect logically to health and safety.
     - **Rating Justification**: The lack of a reasonable connection is apparent here, so I would rate it an 80.
   - **Groundless Reason** (High Defect Rating, ≈ 85): There's no valid reason provided why everything you can put in your mouth would be good for you. It's an unsupported claim.
     - **Rating Justification**: This unfounded assertion makes the argument weak, warranting a rating of 85.

3. **Faulty Proofs of the Reason**:
   - **Inappropriate Proof** (High Defect Rating, ≈ 85): The assertion lacks proper evidence or proof. Any attempt at proof likely would not withstand scrutiny due to numerous known harmful substances.
     - **Rating Justification**: Lacking evidence, it scores high at 85.
   - **False Universals** (High Defect Rating, ≈ 80): Assuming universal applicability (i.e., all things you can put in your mouth are good) which is clearly false.
     - **Rating Justification**: Because of the false universal assumption, an 80 rating is appropriate.
   
4. **Faulty Embellishments**:
   - **Inexact Similes** (Moderate Rating, ≈ 50): If any attempt is made to draw comparisons to support this claim, it would likely miss the complexities and nuances (e.g., comparing food to non-food items).
     - **Rating Justification**: Rating 50 for generally inaccurate comparisons.
   - **Unsupported Examples** (Moderate to High Rating, ≈ 70): Examples given to support such a claim would likely be erroneous or misapplied (e.g., comparing healthy food to non-edible items).
     - **Rating Justification**: Misapplied examples earn it a 70 rating.

### Overall Rating Calculation:
Considering the significant defects across multiple categories, an appropriate aggregate rating would be:

\[
\text{Average Defect Rating} = \frac{(90 + 80 + 85 + 85 + 80 + 50 + 70)}{7} \approx 77
\]

**Final Rating: 77**

### Justifications Summary:
- **Generalization**: Extremely broad and unsubstantiated, rating 90.
- **Inappropriate/Groundless Reason**: No logical reason or evidence, with ratings of 80 and 85 respectively.
- **False Universals**: Incorrect universal applicability; rate at 80.
- **Inexact Similes/Unsupported Examples**: Comparisons and examples likely to be misapplied or incorrect; rated 50 and 70.

The argument "Anything you can put in your mouth is good for you" is heavily defective, scoring approximately 77 on a scale of 1 to 100 based on the analysis using <RB>.
