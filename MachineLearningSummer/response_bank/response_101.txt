Evaluating <SP>: "You must avoid medical doctors when ill because otherwise you will become lazy" for each type of defective argument in <RB> and giving a score out of 100 based on its applicability, we get:

1. **Generalization**: 70/100 
   - This statement does generalize the impact of visiting doctors on becoming lazy, assuming it applies to everyone.

2. **Impossibility**: 20/100
   - The statement does not explicitly present an impossibility but rather a questionable cause-effect relationship.

3. **Incomplete Enumeration**: 40/100
   - By implying that avoiding doctors is the only way to avoid laziness, it fails to consider other solutions or factors for maintaining diligence when ill.

4. **False Enumeration**: 50/100
   - It falsely implies a dichotomy between visiting doctors and becoming lazy versus not visiting them and staying diligent.

5. **Remote Tracing**: 30/100 
   - The statement doesn't necessarily trace back to a remote cause but suggests a direct and questionable cause-effect relationship.

6. **Inappropriate Reason**: 75/100
   - The reasoning (avoiding doctors to prevent laziness) is inappropriate and not logically sound.

7. **Groundless Reason**: 90/100
   - The reason given (becoming lazy by visiting doctors) is largely unsupported and groundless.

8. **Redundant Reason**: 20/100
   - The statement doesn’t repeat itself but rather gives a flawed singular reasoning.

9. **Weak Causal Basis**: 95/100
   - This heavily relies on a weak causal basis, linking doctor's visit directly to becoming lazy without substantial evidence.

10. **Misapplied Reason**: 85/100
    - The rationale is misapplied as the link between seeing a doctor and becoming lazy is unfounded and misplaced.

11. **Dilemma Misuse**: 40/100
    - It presents a form of false dilemma but does not fully meet the classical misuse of a dilemma.

12. **Misapplication of Signs**: 50/100
    - Associating doctor's visits with laziness could be seen as a misapplication of signs but not strongly so.

13. **Peripheral Disputes**: 10/100
    - The argument directly addresses the issue without diverging into peripheral matters.

14. **Banality**: 30/100
    - It's not strictly a commonplace assertion but clearly lacks depth in reasoning.

15. **False Universals**: 70/100
    - It suggests a universal outcome (laziness) from visiting the doctor, which is a generalization.

16. **Belated Arguments**: 20/100
    - This does not apply as the argument isn't about past decisions needing reevaluation.

17. **Misleading Defenses**: 65/100
    - The defense given (to avoid laziness) is misleading because it avoids the primary reason to visit a doctor (health).

18. **Double-Edged Phrases**: 10/100
    - This isn’t a case of a double-edged phrase.

19. **Misleading Definitions**: 55/100
    - It implies a misleading concept that visiting doctors equates to laziness.

20. **Questionable Statements**: 90/100
    - The entire statement is highly questionable and unsupported by evidence.

21. **Inconsistent Reasoning**: 70/100
    - The reasoning is largely inconsistent as it fails logical validity.

22. **Hostile Addressing**: 20/100
    - The tone isn't explicitly hostile but it lightly discredits a sensible action.

23. **Incomplete Proofs**: 85/100
    - There is no substantive proof provided to justify the claim.

24. **Topic Shifting**: 10/100
    - The topic remains within the context of avoiding doctors without shifting.

25. **Fault by Association**: 60/100
    - Equates moral or behavioral outcomes (laziness) with medical practices unfoundedly.

26. **Evidence Mix-Up**: 75/100
    - The argument confuses behavioral outcomes with medical visits without concrete evidence.

27. **Biased Comparisons**: 65/100
    - It draws a biased, unfounded comparison between doctor visits and laziness.

28. **Name Disputes**: 10/100
    - This doesn’t involve semantic disagreements, so it’s largely irrelevant here.

29. **Inexact Similes**: 10/100
    - The argument doesn’t use similes.

30. **Unsupported Examples**: 85/100
    - The argument lacks examples to support its conclusion.

31. **Misapplied Judgements**: 80/100
    - The judgment about becoming lazy from visiting doctors is misapplied and lacks relevance.

32. **Unnecessary Establishments**: 10/100
    - It directly makes an argument without laying unnecessary foundational points.

33. **Amplification Errors**: 55/100
    - It amplifies the effects of visiting doctors beyond reasonable expectations (resulting in laziness).

34. **Incomplete Summaries**: 20/100
    - The statement provides a complete argument (though flawed), without summarizing any larger context.

With a stronger emphasis on **Groundless Reason**, **Weak Causal Basis**, **Misapplied Reason**, **Questionable Statements**, and **Incomplete Proofs**, the argument primarily reflects serious logical flaws and unsupported assumptions.
