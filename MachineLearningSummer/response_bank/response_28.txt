Let's evaluate each step in <SP> according to the defective argument types listed in <RB> and assign a rating from 1 to 100 for how defective each argument is, where 1 indicates not defective at all and 100 indicates extremely defective.

1. **Person 1: I am a woman.**
   - **Rating: 20**
   - **Justification**: This is a straightforward assertion. It's based on a subjective identity claim, which might be criticized for its lack of elaboration or evidence but isn't necessarily defective on its own.

2. **Person 2: How are you a woman even though you are scientifically a male?**
   - **Rating: 50**
   - **Justification**: This could be classified as **Misleading Definitions** since it potentially misinterprets gender identity by equating it strictly with biological sex. The argument fails to consider the complexity of the term "woman" beyond scientific definitions.

3. **Person 1: I feel like a woman so therefore I am a woman.**
   - **Rating: 30**
   - **Justification**: This is an **Inappropriate Reason** because the reasoning is subjunctive and may not be universally compelling. However, it's a valid perspective in discussions of gender identity, though it lacks empirical substantiation.

4. **Person 2: What is a woman?**
   - **Rating: 10**
   - **Justification**: This is a legitimate question and not defective. It's aimed at clarifying the definition of terms in the debate.

5. **Person 1: Someone who feels like a woman.**
   - **Rating: 30**
   - **Justification**: Similar to previous statements, this argument extends from **Inappropriate Reason** due to its subjective basis. It's contextually valid but might not satisfy all audiences or logical scrutiny.

6. **Person 2: A woman is someone who has the ability to produce egg cells, therefore you are not a woman.**
   - **Rating: 70**
   - **Justification**: This can be seen as **Misleading Definitions** and **Fault by Association**. It's a restrictive definition that excludes women who are infertile or past menopause. It also ignores broad societal and psychological definitions of gender.

### Summary of Justifications and Final Ratings

- **Person 1: I am a woman.**
  - **Rating: 20**
  - Straightforward identity claim with little elaboration.

- **Person 2: How are you a woman even though you are scientifically a male?**
  - **Rating: 50**
  - Misleading definition equating gender strictly with biological sex.

- **Person 1: I feel like a woman so therefore I am a woman.**
  - **Rating: 30**
  - Subjective argument, potentially seen as inappropriate reasoning.

- **Person 2: What is a woman?**
  - **Rating: 10**
  - Legitimate question asking for term clarification.

- **Person 1: Someone who feels like a woman.**
  - **Rating: 30**
  - Another subjective definition, potentially seen as inappropriate reasoning.

- **Person 2: A woman is someone who has the ability to produce egg cells, therefore you are not a woman.**
  - **Rating: 70**
  - Restrictive and misleading definition, with potential fault by association.

Overall, Step 6 contains the most defective argument under <RB> criteria, with arguments generally rated between 20 to 70 on the scale of defectiveness.
