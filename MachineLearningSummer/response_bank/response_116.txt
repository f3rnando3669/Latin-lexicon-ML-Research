Analyzing <SP> through the lens of <RB>, I will identify and rate the top three most defective arguments based on their logical severity. Here’s a breakdown:

1. **Generalization**:
    - **Example in <SP>**: "*The goddess Fortune is blind and stupid.*"
    - **Rating**: 85/100
    - **Reason**: This statement makes a sweeping and unqualified generalization about Fortune, attributing broad negative traits without any nuance. It implies that Fortune lacks any semblance of perception or judgment universally, which is an over-simplified and extreme assertion about an abstract concept.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration**:
    - **Example in <SP>**: "*She is blind, for that she fails wholly to perceive whereto she attaches herself.*"
    - **Rating**: 90/100
    - **Reason**: This argument provides an incomplete enumeration by suggesting that because Fortune does not perceive where she attaches herself, she must be wholly blind. It ignores the possibility of partial awareness or selective perception, oversimplifying the complexity of Fortune’s nature.

3. **Redundant Reason**:
    - **Example in <SP>**: "*She is stupid because she knows not how to tell worthy from unworthy.*"
    - **Rating**: 80/100
    - **Reason**: This statement provides a redundant reason by equating the inability to differentiate between the worthy and unworthy directly with being stupid, which is a tautological argument. It essentially says Fortune is stupid just because she is, without a substantial or distinct reasoning process.

Overall Scores:
- **Generalization**: 85/100
- **Incomplete Enumeration**: 90/100
- **Redundant Reason**: 80/100

### Summary
1. **Incomplete Enumeration**: Ranks as the worst due to severely simplifying and omitting other possible perceptions or actions of Fortune (90/100).
2. **Generalization**: Highly defective because it makes an extreme and unqualified blanket statement (85/100).
3. **Redundant Reason**: Defective due to tautology and failing to provide a deeper rationale (80/100).

These scores are given based on the logical flaws, their impact on the overall argument, and the extent to which they oversimplify or misrepresent the concept of Fortune.
