### Final Rating: 95/100

The speech is excellently structured, well-argumented, and effectively delivered. It invokes historical and legal principles to make a compelling case for governance principles, constitutional interpretation, and the responsibilities of executive power. The only minor deduction comes from the limited use of direct emotional appeal to pity.
