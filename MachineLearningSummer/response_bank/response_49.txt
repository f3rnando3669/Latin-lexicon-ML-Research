To rate how defective the arguments are in the statement "You must avoid medical doctors when ill because otherwise you will become lazy," let's break it down according to the categories outlined in <RB> and assign ratings.

**Step 1: Proposition Analysis**
- **Proposition**: "You must avoid medical doctors when ill."
  - *Faulty Proposition*:
    - **Generalization**: The statement generalizes all medical treatments as yielding the same result—laziness.
    - **Impossibility**: Suggests that consulting doctors will always result in laziness. 

**Rating**: 80 (High Defectiveness) due to broad generalization and impossibility.

**Step 2: Reason Analysis**
- **Reason**: "Because otherwise you will become lazy."
  - *Weak or Groundless Reason*:
    - **Groundless Reason**: There is no logical or empirical evidence provided to link consulting doctors with laziness directly.
    - **Inappropriate Reason**: Promotes a non-sequitur; illness and seeking medical help are not logically correlated with resulting in laziness.
    - **Redundant Reason**: Rephrasing the proposition without adding substantive support.
    - **Weak Causal Basis**: The causal relationship between medical consultation and laziness is weak and unsubstantiated.

**Rating**: 90 (Very High Defectiveness) due to groundlessness, inaptness, and the weak causal link.

**Step 3: Proof of the Reason Analysis**
- **Proof of the Reason**: Not explicitly provided, but implied reasoning is that dependency on doctors leads to laziness.
  - *Faulty Proofs of the Reason*:
    - **Misapplied Reason**: No evidence or detailed argument is provided to logically support why medical help results in laziness.
    - **Questionable Statements**: The claim rests on an unproven assertion with no empirical backing.
    - **Inconsistent Reasoning**: The claim doesn’t align with general understanding—treatment usually aims at recovery and functional restoration.
    - **Peripheral Disputes**: This shifts the discourse from the actual benefit of medical treatment to an unsupported behavioral outcome.

**Rating**: 90 (Very High Defectiveness) given the lack of proof and misapplication of the reasoning.

**Step 4: Embellishment Analysis**
- *Not applicable or unspecified in <SP>*.

**Rating**: Not available as embellishments were not addressed or applied specifically.

**Step 5: Résumé Analysis**
- *Not applicable or unspecified in <SP>*.

**Rating**: Not available as the résumé was not applied specifically.

### Final Defectiveness Rating:

- **Proposition Defectiveness**: 80 
- **Reason Defectiveness**: 90 
- **Proof of the Reason Defectiveness**: 90
- **Overall Weighted Average**: Sum of ratings divided by 3 (since embellishment and résumé are not applied).

\[ \text{Overall Rating} = \frac{80 + 90 + 90}{3} = 86.67 \]

### Justification Summary:
The statement "You must avoid medical doctors when ill because otherwise you will become lazy" is highly defective due to substantial generalization, inadequate evidence, groundless and inappropriate reasons, faulty causality, and unproven assertions, culminating in a high defectiveness rating of approximately 87.

**Final Rating**: 87
