To assess the argument presented in statement <SP> "No one can graduate from university before the age of 19" and rate its defensiveness on a scale of 1 to 100 using the criteria derived from <RB>, we will analyze it step by step:

1. **Faulty Propositions**:
   - **Impossibility (Rating: 90)**: The statement categorically implies that it's impossible for anyone to graduate from university before the age of 19, which can be easily disproven by presenting exceptions (e.g., child prodigies). It fails to acknowledge rare but plausible scenarios and hence holds a high degree of defectiveness.
   - **Generalization (Rating: 85)**: The statement makes a general claim that might be broadly applicable but overlooks individual variances and special cases. This overgeneralization weakens the argument.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (Rating: 50)**: Less applicable here as the argument doesn’t list multiple options, but makes an absolute statement. Still, it does neglect other potential age ranges for graduation.
   - **False Enumeration/Remote Tracing (Not applicable)**: These categories don’t directly apply as the argument isn't listing multiple causes or overly tracing the origin.

2. **Weak or Groundless Reasons**:
   - **Groundless Reason (Rating: 80)**: Without supporting evidence or a strong basis, the claim is groundless. The statement does not provide reasons or statistical data to justify why individuals can't graduate before 19.
   - **Inappropriate Reason (Not applicable)**: The statement doesn’t provide any reason to evaluate, hence this criterion doesn’t apply.
   - **Redundant Reason (Not applicable)**: The argument doesn’t repeat itself in different forms.
   - **Weak Causal Basis/Misapplied Reason (Rating: 60)**: Albeit a single simplistic assertion, if it lacks robust causal backing and applies to certain cases only superficially, it’s weak.

3. **Faulty Proofs of the Reason**:
   - **Misapplication of Signs (Rating: 75)**: Announcing a universal age limit without flexible consideration misuses the sign of academic progression (graduation) as fixed by age.
   - **False Universals (Rating: 85)**: This argument presumes a universally agreed point ("No one..." is an assertion without proof).
   - **Banality/Biased Comparisons/Peripheral Disputes (Rating: 60)**: The simplicity and reliance on a supposedly common-sense view weaken its status but not immensely flawed.
   - **Other aspects (Hostile Addressing, Double-Edged Phrases, etc.) (Not applicable)**: The statement doesn't directly address audiences, isn't dual-interpretable, or depend on referencing unrelated judgments.

4. **Faulty Embellishments**:
   - **Inexact Similes/Unsupported Examples (Not applicable)**: The statement doesn't employ these devices.
   - **Misapplied Judgments (Rating: 60)**: If similar age-insisted judgments exist unreasonably, the similar faulty assertion applies here.
   - **Amplification Errors/Incomplete Summaries (Not applicable)**: The simplicity of the assertion implies no complications or summarizing needs.

Summarizing the detailed defectiveness:
- Impossibility: 90
- Generalization: 85
- Incomplete Enumeration: 50
- Groundless Reason: 80
- Weak Causal Basis: 60
- Misapplication of Signs: 75
- False Universals: 85
- Banality/Biased Comparisons: 60
- Misapplied Judgments: 60

With these individual high defect points mainly clustered around 60-90, averaging this mix provides a general cumulative rating. We fuse heavy weighs of Impossibility, Groundless/False Universals balancing but less apex-impactful like inapplicability aspects.

**Overall defectiveness rating: 75/100**

This high rating elucidates the argument "No one can graduate from university before the age of 19" is predominantly defective within the rhetoric guidelines. The argument lacks flexibility, evidence, and acknowledgements of exceptions that undermine its legitimacy.
