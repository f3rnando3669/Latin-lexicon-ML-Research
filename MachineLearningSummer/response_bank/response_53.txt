To evaluate the degree to which the arguments in <SP> are defective using <RB>, let's break down each argument and assess it based on the identified types of defective arguments. We will rate them individually and then combine those ratings to provide an overall score.

1. **Argument: There is no such thing as Fortune; there is, they say, Blind Accident.**
   - **Type of Defective Argument**: This statement could be classified as an **assertion without proof**. The claim "there is no such thing as Fortune" and that it is replaced by "Blind Accident" is made without substantial evidence or reasoning.
   - **Rating Justification**: 90/100 (Highly defective due to its unproven and generalized nature without supporting evidence.)

2. **Supporting Evidence: That this is more like the truth, is proved by the actual experience of life; even as Orestes now was king, and now became a beggar.**
   - **Type of Defective Argument**: This part employs **generalization** and **unsupported examples**. Using the case of Orestes to generalize about the nature of Fortune and Blind Accident is not enough to prove the claim universally.
   - **Rating Justification**: 85/100 (Highly defective as it relies on a single historical or mythological example to prove a broad and complex claim.)

Bringing the parts together:

1. **Generalization**: Heavy use of generalization claiming that the experience of one individual (Orestes) can represent the concept for all of human experience – 85/100.
2. **Unsupported Examples**: Using unsupported historical or mythological instances fails to provide a robust foundation for such grand assertions – 85/100.
3. **Assertion without Proof**: Bold claims like "there is no Fortune" represent a high degree of defectiveness without substantial backing – 90/100.

Considering all these points, the overall defectiveness rating for the arguments in <SP> would be an average of these scores:

\[ \text{Overall Defectiveness} = \frac{85 + 85 + 90}{3} = 86.67 \]

Thus, the overall rating of how defective the arguments are in <SP> would be:
**87/100**.

Justifications point to heavy reliance on generalization, unsupported examples, and assertions without proof, leading to a highly defective argumentative framework.
