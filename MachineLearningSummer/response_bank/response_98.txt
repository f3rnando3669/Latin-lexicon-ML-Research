To analyze <SP> using the framework provided in <RB>, I will assess each type of defective argument against the given statement: "The goddess Fortune is blind and stupid. She is blind, for that she fails wholly to perceive whereto she attaches herself. She is stupid because she knows not how to tell worthy from unworthy." Scores will range from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating that the statement strongly exemplifies a particular type of defective argument.

1. **Generalization** (Score: 70):
   - The statement makes a sweeping claim about Fortune being blind and stupid without offering any exceptions or qualifications, a common indication of overgeneralization.

2. **Impossibility** (Score: 20):
   - While it heavily criticizes Fortune, the statement doesn’t imply an impossible outcome outright.

3. **Incomplete Enumeration** (Score: 50):
   - It neglects to consider other possible attributes of Fortune besides blindness and stupidity.

4. **False Enumeration** (Score: 60):
   - The argument might be seen as reducing the complex concept of fortune to just two attributes, ignoring other potential qualities.

5. **Remote Tracing** (Score: 40):
   - The claim does not delve deeply into historical or distant causal factors for these attributes.

6. **Inappropriate Reason** (Score: 30):
   - The reasoning provided (blind because she fails to perceive; stupid because she can’t tell worthy from unworthy) could be seen as tenuous but not entirely inappropriate.

7. **Groundless Reason** (Score: 70):
   - There's no concrete evidence presented to support these attributes of Fortune, making the reasons given seem baseless.

8. **Redundant Reason** (Score: 30):
   - The reasons (blind because she can't see; stupid because she can’t tell differences) are somewhat tautological but not entirely redundant.

9. **Weak Causal Basis** (Score: 80):
   - The attributes assigned to Fortune are based on very weak or non-existent causal relationships.

10. **Misapplied Reason** (Score: 40):
    - The reasons provided are specific to the attributes and not misapplied to unrelated concepts.

11. **Dilemma Misuse** (Score: 20):
    - There isn't a false dilemma presented; it does not force a choice between two extremes inappropriately.

12. **Misapplication of Signs** (Score: 20):
    - It does not apply irrelevant signs or symptoms to diagnose Fortune's attributes.

13. **Peripheral Disputes** (Score: 30):
    - The argument does not divert attention to unrelated secondary issues.

14. **Banality** (Score: 60):
    - The reasons given (failure to perceive, can't tell worthy from unworthy) seem somewhat banal and don’t add much depth to the argument.

15. **False Universals** (Score: 80):
    - The statement uses universals ("wholly" and "knows not") without foundation, applying attributes globally without evidence.

16. **Belated Arguments** (Score: 20):
    - The argument does not fall back on past actions to explain current attributes.

17. **Misleading Defenses** (Score: 50):
    - The defenses for calling Fortune blind and stupid could be seen as misleading due to lack of evidence and justification.

18. **Double-Edged Phrases** (Score: 30):
    - It does not use double-edged language where praise and criticism are intertwined.

19. **Misleading Definitions** (Score: 70):
    - Calling Fortune "blind" and "stupid" without a proper framework for these terms within the context is misleading.

20. **Questionable Statements** (Score: 90):
    - The central assertions (blind and stupid) are highly questionable due to the lack of substantiation.

21. **Inconsistent Reasoning** (Score: 40):
    - The reasoning here is weak but doesn’t explicitly show inconsistency within the given attributes.

22. **Hostile Addressing** (Score: 50):
    - The language is somewhat hostile in labelling Fortune as blind and stupid.

23. **Incomplete Proofs** (Score: 80):
    - Proofs provided are far from complete and rely on broad, unsupported claims.

24. **Topic Shifting** (Score: 20):
    - The argument stays on topic, rather than shifting to irrelevant issues.

25. **Fault by Association** (Score: 50):
    - There is a potential implicit fault by associating blindness and stupidity without proper context or understanding.

26. **Evidence Mix-Up** (Score: 50):
    - There is a mixing of concepts (e.g., personification of a goddess like Fortune in terms of human attributes) that lacks clarity and substantiation.

27. **Biased Comparisons** (Score: 30):
    - The argument itself doesn't explicitly compare Fortune to another entity using undue bias.

28. **Name Disputes** (Score: 20):
    - It does not engage in disputes over terminology or names.

29. **Inexact Similes** (Score: 60):
    - A metaphorical assertion (blind, stupid) without precision impacts clarity and plausibility.

30. **Unsupported Examples** (Score: 80):
    - Defining Fortune with unsupported attributes without concrete examples or evidence.

31. **Misapplied Judgements** (Score: 50):
    - The judgment that Fortune is blind and stupid might be seen as misapplying these human qualities.

32. **Unnecessary Establishments** (Score: 30):
    - There are no overly obvious facts being restated unnecessarily.

33. **Amplification Errors** (Score: 50):
    - The argument possibly amplifies Fortune's attributes in an exaggerated manner without solid basis.

34. **Incomplete Summaries** (Score: 40):
    - The reasoning, though short, does cover the initial assertions made about Fortune's attributes.

Summary:
The statement <SP> predominantly scores high in categories involving questionable or groundless reasoning and making unsupported claims. It exemplifies several common fallacies, particularly in the assumptions of blind and stupid attributes without sufficient substantiation.
