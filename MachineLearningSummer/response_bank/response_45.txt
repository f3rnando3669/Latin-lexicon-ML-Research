Let's analyze the statement "<SP> One must avoid the sun because it is far away from us" using the criteria from <RB>:

1. **Faulty Propositions**:
   - **Inappropriate Reason** (Rating: 90): The reason given for avoiding the sun ("because it is far away from us") is not logically connected to the proposition ("One must avoid the sun"). The distance of the sun from Earth is not a valid reason for avoiding it.
   - **Generalization** (Rating: 70): This argument can be considered a weak form of generalization, assuming a universal action ("One must avoid the sun") based on an inappropriate criterion (distance).
   
2. **Weak or Groundless Reasons**:
   - **Groundless Reason** (Rating: 95): The reason provided is factually weak and doesn't withstand scrutiny. Thereâ€™s no logical basis to suggest that the distance of the sun from Earth necessitates avoiding it.
   - **Redundant Reason** (Rating: 85): While not explicitly redundant, the reason is essentially meaningless in this context and could be seen as similarly ineffective.
   - **Weak Causal Basis** (Rating: 90): The causal relationship between the sun's distance and the need to avoid it is extremely weak, if not non-existent.
   - **Misapplied Reason** (Rating: 80): The reason is misapplied; distance is not an appropriate factor in determining whether or not to avoid the sun.

3. **Faulty Proofs of the Reason**:
   - **Misapplication of Signs** (Rating: 85): Misapplying the sign of "being far away" to indicate something that is avoidable, which is not logically coherent.
   - **False Universals** (Rating: 75): Asserting that because the sun is far, it should be avoided, without providing a valid universal connection or proof.
   - **Misleading Defenses** (Rating: 80): Using the distance of the sun as pretext to suggest avoidance is misleading.
   - **Misleading Definitions** (Rating: 85): The argument could be seen as providing a misleading definition of why something should be avoided.
   - **Inappropriate Reasoning** (Rating: 90): This statement exemplifies inconsistency or inappropriate logic, forming a circular or baseless argument.

4. **Faulty Embellishments**:
   - **Unsupported Examples** (Rating: 85): The statement lacks any specific examples to support avoiding the sun due to distance, making it unsupported.
   - **Misapplied Judgements** (Rating: 80): The notion of "far away" as a risk factor is a misapplied judgment here, as it lacks relevance and empirical backing.
   - **Unnecessary Establishments** (Rating: 75): Arguably, the point that the sun is far away does not need to be established to argue avoidance, making the argument unnecessary.

**Summary Rating**:
Upon aggregating and averaging the justifications with respect to their severity and relevance to <RB>, we can objectively rate the overall defective nature of the argument in <SP>.

**Final Rating**: 85

**Justification Summary**:
The argument put forth in <SP> profoundly exemplifies inappropriate, groundless reasoning and falls under several categories of faulty logic as detailed in <RB>. Each component of the argument is critically weak, misleading, and fails to provide a coherent, logically sound basis for the conclusion. Therefore, the rating is high, indicating a highly defective argument.
