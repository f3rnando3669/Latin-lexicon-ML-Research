Analyzing the statement **<SP>** in light of the defective arguments from **<RB>**:

### **Statement Analysis:**
> *"In our wretched life there any such thing as Fortune; there is, they say, Blind Accident. That this is more like the truth, is proved by the actual experience of life; even as Orestes now was king, and now became a beggar."*

### **Score for Defective Argument Types:**

1. **Generalization**: 2/5
   - Assumes "actual experience of life" universally proves the argument by citing a single example (Orestes).
   
2. **Impossibility**: 1/5
   - Does not outright declare any rare event as impossible but suggests a deterministic view.

3. **Incomplete Enumeration**: 3/5
   - Does not consider all possible causes of life's unpredictability beyond "Fortune" and "Blind Accident."

4. **False Enumeration**: 3/5
   - Suggests only two forces (Fortune and Blind Accident) may affect life without listing others like personal choices or fate.

5. **Remote Tracing**: 1/5
   - Stays within a reasonable context, although naming Orestes as a historical or mythological example.

6. **Inappropriate Reason**: 2/5
   - Uses the story of Orestes (a myth) to support a broad philosophical claim about life, a weak connection.

7. **Groundless Reason**: 3/5
   - "Actual experience" is not substantiated with broader evidence, relying on anecdote.

8. **Redundant Reason**: 1/5
   - Avoids reiteration using different terms.

9. **Weak Causal Basis**: 3/5
   - The argument's basis (Orestes’ life) may not be broadly compelling as a general truth about life's randomness.

10. **Misapplied Reason**: 2/5
    - The reason given (Orestes' fall) should critique determinism or other similar concepts, but tries to negate "Fortune".

11. **Dilemma Misuse**: 1/5
    - Avoids creating a dilemma directly.

12. **Misapplication of Signs**: 1/5
    - Does not misuse signs or symptoms to indicate one specific conclusion.

13. **Peripheral Disputes**: 2/5
    - The example of Orestes applies broadly but can be seen as peripheral in philosophical discourse.

14. **Banality**: 2/5
    - The argument about "experience of life" is somewhat conventional.

15. **False Universals**: 3/5
    - Implies a universal truth without robust evidence.

16. **Belated Arguments**: 1/5
    - Arguments are presented in context without notable delay.

17. **Misleading Defenses**: 2/5
    - Solely relies on the anecdote for defense.

18. **Double-Edged Phrases**: 1/5
    - Statements are clear without dual interpretations.

19. **Misleading Definitions**: 2/5
    - Definition of "Blind Accident" vs. "Fortune" could be clarified.

20. **Questionable Statements**: 3/5
    - Assertions about life’s unpredictability are not sufficiently justified.

21. **Inconsistent Reasoning**: 1/5
    - Avoids direct contradictions within the argument.

22. **Hostile Addressing**: 1/5
    - Neutral tone, does not engage hostility.

23. **Incomplete Proofs**: 3/5
    - Lacks comprehensive evidence for the claim.

24. **Topic Shifting**: 2/5
    - Stays on topic but relies on a narrow example.

25. **Fault by Association**: 1/5
    - Does not disparage fields due to practitioners' faults.

26. **Evidence Mix-Up**: 2/5
    - Example of Orestes is not robust proof for the broader claim.

27. **Biased Comparisons**: 3/5
    - Comparatively simplistic view rejecting "Fortune" by citing only one counterexample.

28. **Name Disputes**: 1/5
    - No direct controversy over naming conventions is apparent.

29. **Inexact Similes**: 2/5
    - "King to beggar" is a stark, effective simile but still oversimplifies complex life changes.

30. **Unsupported Examples**: 3/5
    - Example of Orestes may be seen as inadequate for general proof.

31. **Misapplied Judgments**: 1/5
    - Avoids irrelevant judgments.

32. **Unnecessary Establishments**: 2/5
    - Tries to prove a point possibly granted by the opponent already.

33. **Amplification Errors**: 2/5
    - Amplifies the single example beyond its actual scope.

34. **Incomplete Summaries**: 2/5
    - Presents a summary but concentrated left without in-depth exploration.

The overall assessment shows multiple types of defective arguments, primarily focusing on weak causal bases, false enumeration, groundless and inappropriately applied reasons. The argument is overly reliant on a single anecdotal example of mythological origin to support a broad philosophical claim.
