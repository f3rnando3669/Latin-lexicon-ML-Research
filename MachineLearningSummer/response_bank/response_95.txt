I'll score the argument "Anything you can put in your mouth is good for you" from 0 to 100 based on the different types of defective arguments listed in the response <RB>. A higher score indicates the argument strongly falls under that particular type of fallacy or error, while a lower score indicates weaker relevance.

1. **Generalization**: 100
   - The statement makes an overgeneralized claim without exceptions.

2. **Impossibility**: 10
   - The argument’s broad claim doesn’t inherently rely on an impossible premise.

3. **Incomplete Enumeration**: 85
   - The argument doesn't consider the variety of things one can put in their mouth that aren't good for you.

4. **False Enumeration**: 80
   - Similar to incomplete enumeration, it falsely suggests all ingestible things are beneficial.

5. **Remote Tracing**: 10
   - The argument doesn’t attempt to trace the claim to a distant cause.

6. **Inappropriate Reason**: 90
   - It applies an overly broad and simplistic reason to what is inherently a complex issue.

7. **Groundless Reason**: 100
   - There is no sound basis for claiming everything ingestible is good for you.

8. **Redundant Reason**: 10
   - The statement doesn’t utilize circular reasoning or tautology.

9. **Weak Causal Basis**: 100
   - The argument implies an unsupported cause-and-effect relationship between ingestibility and healthiness.

10. **Misapplied Reason**: 90
    - It suggests an inaccurate and misapplied reasoning that anything consumable is beneficial.

11. **Dilemma Misuse**: 20
    - Doesn’t really present a false dilemma, but rather a broad overstatement.

12. **Misapplication of Signs**: 70
    - It misapplies the ability to consume something as a sign of its goodness.

13. **Peripheral Disputes**: 10
    - The statement itself does not introduce or depend on peripheral issues.

14. **Banality**: 30
    - It’s somewhat banal in its hyper simplicity, though not extremely so.

15. **False Universals**: 100
    - The argument leverages a false universal claim, suggesting all ingestible items are beneficial.

16. **Belated Arguments**: 10
    - The argument is not based on hindsight or could-have-been scenarios.

17. **Misleading Defenses**: 85
    - Proposing that anything consumable is good for you is a very misleading defense.

18. **Double-Edged Phrases**: 30
    - The argument is overly broad but not particularly double-edged.

19. **Misleading Definitions**: 100
    - The claim misleads by equating anything that can be eaten with being good for you.

20. **Questionable Statements**: 100
    - The entire statement is highly questionable and lacks support.

21. **Inconsistent Reasoning**: 70
    - The logic behind the statement is inconsistent given the varied health impacts of different ingestibles.

22. **Hostile Addressing**: 10
    - The argument doesn’t have a hostile tone.

23. **Incomplete Proofs**: 100
    - There is a complete lack of proof for such a broad claim.

24. **Topic Shifting**: 50
    - Depending on the context, this could shift topics from specific dietary discussions to overly generalized health claims.

25. **Fault by Association**: 30
    - The argument doesn’t inherently associate unrelated negative traits.

26. **Evidence Mix-Up**: 90
    - The lack of evidence or the mix-up in supporting such a claim is a major issue.

27. **Biased Comparisons**: 50
    - There are implied biased comparisons between all ingestible items and their health benefits.

28. **Name Disputes**: 10
    - No name dispute is involved.

29. **Inexact Similes**: 90
    - Implicitly compares all ingestible items to being beneficial, which is extremely inexact.

    - There are no examples provided to support the wide-ranging claim.

31. **Misapplied Judgements**: 85
    - Judgements about the healthiness of all things ingestible are grossly misapplied.

32. **Unnecessary Establishments**: 10
    - The argument does not establish unnecessary premises as part of its reasoning.

33. **Amplification Errors**: 90
    - The claim amplifies the definition of "ingestible" to an unreasonable extent.

34. **Incomplete Summaries**: 80
    - The statement is an incomplete summary, lacking nuance and substantiated details.

Overall, the argument "Anything you can put in your mouth is good for you" is a prime example of faulty reasoning, scoring high in numerous types of fallacies and argumentative errors.
