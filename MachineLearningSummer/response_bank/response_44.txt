To rate the arguments in <SP> based on the guidelines provided in <RB>, we need to dissect each component of the argument and evaluate it according to the various types of defective arguments listed. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

### Step 1: Initial Proposition

**"Stupidity is the mother and matter of all evils."**

- **Overly Broad Generalization (Rating: 90/100 Defective)**: This proposition makes a sweeping claim without substantial proof or reasoning. It is an example of **False Universals** and **Incomplete Enumeration** since it attributes all evil actions solely to stupidity, neglecting other potential factors like malice, ignorance, etc.

### Step 2: Reason for the Proposition

**"She gives birth to boundless desires. Furthermore, boundless desires have neither end nor limit. They breed avarice."**

- **Groundless Reason (Rating: 70/100 Defective)**: The step lacks concrete evidence that directly links stupidity to the birth of boundless desires. This can be seen as a weak or unsupported generalization.
- **Weak Causal Basis (Rating: 80/100 Defective)**: The argument that boundless desires invariably breed avarice is not substantiated with specific examples or evidence. This could be considered a **False Enumeration** as it doesn't consider other possible consequences of boundless desires.
  
### Step 3: Further Reason

**"Avarice, further, drives men to any crime you will."**

- **Inappropriate Reason (Rating: 60/100 Defective)**: While avarice may lead to crime, it’s an overstatement to claim it drives men to "any" crime. This is an example of **Generalization** and passes over other motives for crime like desperation, need, or revenge.
- **Unsubstantiated Universality (Rating: 75/100 Defective)**: The claim needs more substantial evidence to support that avarice is a universal driver of criminal behavior. 

### Step 4: Conclusion and Specific Application

**"Thus it is avarice which has led our adversaries to take this crime upon themselves."**

- **Fault by Association (Rating: 65/100 Defective)**: The conclusion assumes avarice is the motive without considering specific evidence against the adversaries. It's essentially a **Peripheral Dispute** if there's no direct link shown between the adversaries' actions and avarice, leading to a failure to properly establish causation.
- **Incomplete Proofs (Rating: 70/100 Defective)**: The argument doesn’t thoroughly prove that avarice specifically led the adversaries to commit the crime, hence failing to substantiate all parts of the claim.

### Summary Rating

Combining these elements, we sum the average of individual defectiveness scores: 

\[ \text{Average Defectiveness} = \frac{90 + 70 + 80 + 60 + 75 + 65 + 70}{7} \approx 73 \]

The overall defectiveness rating is around **73/100**. This indicates the argument in <SP> is significantly defective and would likely be easy to refute according to the criteria outlined in <RB>. The primary issues are broad generalizations, weak causation, and unsupported assertions, which all contribute to its vulnerability in a rhetorical or logical analysis.
