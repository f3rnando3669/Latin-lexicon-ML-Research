For false_enum.txt
Let's analyze the statement "Only money can make people do heinous things" using the different types of defective arguments mentioned in <RB>. We will score out of 100 based on how strongly each type of defective argument applies, with 100 being a perfect match.

1. **Generalization**: 90
   - The statement generalizes the motivations for heinous acts to just one cause, which is money.

2. **Impossibility**: 10
   - The statement isn't directly claiming an impossibility but does imply an unrealistic limitation of human motivations.

3. **Incomplete Enumeration**: 95
   - By claiming only money can cause heinous acts, it disregards other motivators such as power, revenge, and ideology.

4. **False Enumeration**: 90
   - Similar to incomplete enumeration, it falsely limits the causes of heinous acts to solely money.

5. **Remote Tracing**: 10
   - The statement isn't attempting to trace the cause of heinous acts to a distant origin.

6. **Inappropriate Reason**: 85
   - The reason given is not appropriate as heinous acts can arise from various causes beyond money.

7. **Groundless Reason**: 90
   - There is no solid foundation or evidence supporting that only money motivates heinous acts.

8. **Redundant Reason**: 5
   - The statement doesn’t involve redundancy.

9. **Weak Causal Basis**: 100
   - There is a very weak (and incorrect) causal basis for attributing all heinous acts to money alone.

10. **Misapplied Reason**: 80
    - The reasoning is misapplied by focusing solely on money and ignoring other potential causes.

11. **Dilemma Misuse**: 5
    - It does not present a false dilemma.

12. **Misapplication of Signs**: 10
    - The statement does not really involve the misuse of signs or symptoms of a condition/cause.

13. **Peripheral Disputes**: 10
    - This isn't arguing about peripheral issues but making a broad, central claim.

14. **Banality**: 40
    - The reasoning is overly simplistic but isn't exactly a cliché or trite explanation.

15. **False Universals**: 100
    - The statement fits perfectly as a false universal, claiming only one reason for a very complex behavior.

16. **Belated Arguments**: 5
    - It doesn't deal with hindsight or arguments about past errors.

17. **Misleading Defenses**: 85
    - The claim could be seen as a misleading defense by oversimplifying the motives behind heinous acts.

18. **Double-Edged Phrases**: 5
    - It does not use double-edged phrases.

19. **Misleading Definitions**: 75
    - The definition of motivations behind heinous acts is misleadingly simplified.

20. **Questionable Statements**: 100
    - The statement is highly questionable because it is overly simplistic and not evidence-based.

21. **Inconsistent Reasoning**: 80
    - There could be inconsistency if the speaker acknowledges other motivators in different contexts.

22. **Hostile Addressing**: 5
    - It doesn't address anyone in a hostile manner.

23. **Incomplete Proofs**: 90
    - No proof is provided for the assertion, making it an example of incomplete argumentation.

24. **Topic Shifting**: 10
    - It does not shift topics but stays on topic, though simplistically.

25. **Fault by Association**: 30
    - Slightly relates, as it implies all heinous acts are associated with the motivation of money, though indirectly.

26. **Evidence Mix-Up**: 80
    - The lack of evidence and poor basis for the claim shows a mix-up in understanding the causes of heinous acts.

27. **Biased Comparisons**: 85
    - It unfairly compares money as the sole motivator, ignoring a balanced view of all possible causes.

28. **Name Disputes**: 5
    - This isn't about a dispute over terminology.

29. **Inexact Similes**: 5
    - No similes are used.

30. **Unsupported Examples**: 100
    - The statement is an absolute claim with no supporting examples.

31. **Misapplied Judgements**: 90
    - Misapplied judgment about human behavior by focusing only on money without considering broader evidence.

32. **Unnecessary Establishments**: 80
    - If the motivation of money does need to be established, making it the exclusive reason is unnecessary and overly simplistic.

33. **Amplification Errors**: 100
    - The error is heavily amplified by claiming exclusivity for money as a cause.

34. **Incomplete Summaries**: 85
    - The statement summarizes the causes of heinous acts incompletely, omitting other significant factors.
