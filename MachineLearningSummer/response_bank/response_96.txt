For remote_tracing.txt
Let's analyze the text "<SP>" using the list of defective arguments provided in "<RB>" and score each applicable fallacy out of 100. The higher the score, the more clearly the fallacy applies.

1. **Generalization**
   - Score: 90/100
   - Explanation: The argument generalizes "stupidity" as the root cause of all evils and desires leading to avarice and crime without considering other possible factors.

2. **Impossibility**
   - Score: 30/100
   - Explanation: The argument implies that avarice drives men to "any crime," which suggests an exaggeration rather than an absolute impossibility.

3. **Incomplete Enumeration**
   - Score: 70/100
   - Explanation: The argument lists only a few steps (stupidity, desires, avarice) leading to crime, ignoring other potential causes or influences.

4. **False Enumeration**
   - Score: 75/100
   - Explanation: It positions avarice as a direct result of boundless desires due to stupidity, ignoring other factors like poverty, social conditions, or mental health.

5. **Remote Tracing**
   - Score: 90/100
   - Explanation: It traces the cause of crimes to avarice which stems from desires resulting from stupidity, creating a very indirect and possibly tenuous connection.

6. **Inappropriate Reason**
   - Score: 85/100
   - Explanation: Assuming that stupidity alone leads to endless desires and crime can be considered inappropriate without considering other societal or psychological reasons.

7. **Groundless Reason**
   - Score: 80/100
   - Explanation: The argument lacks concrete evidence or reasoning to substantiate the claim that stupidity leads to avarice and crime.

8. **Redundant Reason**
   - Score: 20/100
   - Explanation: Not applicable here; the argument does not repeat itself unnecessarily.

9. **Weak Causal Basis**
   - Score: 90/100
   - Explanation: The causal chain from stupidity to crime via desires and avarice is weak and lacks evidence.

10. **Misapplied Reason**
   - Score: 65/100
   - Explanation: The relationship between stupidity, desires, avarice, and crime might be mistaken and not universally applicable.

11. **Dilemma Misuse**
   - Score: 30/100
   - Explanation: There is no clear misuse of a dilemma in the argument.

12. **Misapplication of Signs**
   - Score: 50/100
   - Explanation: There is a tenuous association between stupidity as a sign for desires and crime.

13. **Peripheral Disputes**
   - Score: 30/100
   - Explanation: The argument does not sidetrack into unrelated personal attacks or disputes.

14. **Banality**
   - Score: 60/100
   - Explanation: The argument deals in broad and somewhat obvious statements about human nature and desire.

15. **False Universals**
   - Score: 85/100
   - Explanation: It makes sweeping statements about stupidity leading to boundless desires and avarice, implying this is always the case.

16. **Belated Arguments**
   - Score: 40/100
   - Explanation: The text doesn't argue from hindsight or past opportunities missed.

17. **Misleading Defenses**
   - Score: 30/100
   - Explanation: The argument doesn’t defend a position using misleading statements but asserts causes and effects related to stupidity.

18. **Double-Edged Phrases**
   - Score: 20/100
   - Explanation: It doesn't use subtly insulting or two-faced compliments in its claims.

19. **Misleading Definitions**
   - Score: 70/100
   - Explanation: The definitions or implications of "stupidity," "desires," and "avarice" could be seen as overly simplistic or misleading.

20. **Questionable Statements**
   - Score: 90/100
   - Explanation: The argument presents highly questionable connections between stupidity and crime without support.

21. **Inconsistent Reasoning**
   - Score: 50/100
   - Explanation: The reasoning is consistent but misguided and oversimplified.

22. **Hostile Addressing**
   - Score: 10/100
   - Explanation: The tone of the argument isn't hostile towards a specific audience.

23. **Incomplete Proofs**
   - Score: 85/100
   - Explanation: There are no substantial proofs provided to support the assertions made.

24. **Topic Shifting**
   - Score: 20/100
   - Explanation: The argument does not shift topics unexpectedly; it remains focused on the progression from stupidity to crime.

25. **Fault by Association**
   - Score: 75/100
   - Explanation: Stupidity is associated with crimes by linking through desires and avarice without proof.

26. **Evidence Mix-Up**
   - Score: 80/100
   - Explanation: There is a lack of clear, empirical evidence supporting the claims.

27. **Biased Comparisons**
   - Score: 50/100
   - Explanation: The comparison is implied that all actions driven by avarice are crimes, which is biased and not necessarily true.

28. **Name Disputes**
   - Score: 10/100
   - Explanation: The argument doesn't involve disputes over terminology.

29. **Inexact Similes**
   - Score: 50/100
   - Explanation: The metaphorical use of avarice and desires might be inexact or exaggerated.

30. **Unsupported Examples**
   - Score: 70/100
   - Explanation: There are no specific examples given to illustrate the argument, making it unsupported.

31. **Misapplied Judgements**
   - Score: 60/100
   - Explanation: There seems to be a misapplication of judgment connecting stupidity directly to evil, desires, and avarice.

32. **Unnecessary Establishments**
   - Score: 40/100
   - Explanation: It doesn’t aim to establish facts already known, but it does create unnecessary links between stupidity and crime.

33. **Amplification Errors**
   - Score: 85/100
   - Explanation: The text amplifies the importance of stupidity in causing crimes considerably.

34. **Incomplete Summaries**
   - Score: 50/100
   - Explanation: The argument may feel incomplete in justifications but has a clear albeit oversimplified point.
