For remote_tracing.txt
To evaluate the argument "The reason why you do crime is because reality exists" using the guidelines from the Rule book (RB), we will assess its coherence, logical soundness, and adherence to the principles outlined in RB. Let's break this down step by step according to the potential defects mentioned in RB.

### Evaluation:

1. **Faulty Propositions**:
   - **Generalization**: There is no generalization in <SP>.
   - **Impossibility**: No impossible occurrence is claimed.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration**: This argument doesn’t list specific causes or alternatives.
   - **False Enumeration**: It doesn’t enumerate options but makes a binary connection between crime and reality.
   - **Remote Tracing**: The argument implies a vast, nebulous cause (reality), potentially considered remote tracing.

    **Rating for Faulty Propositions**: 50
    *Justification*: The idea that "reality" is a direct cause of crime is overly abstract and remote, lacking precision and specificity. 

2. **Weak or Groundless Reasons**:
   - **Inappropriate Reason**: The reasoning here ("reality exists") is not logically appropriate for explaining crime.
   - **Groundless Reason**: The claim lacks substantial evidence or a clear logical basis.
   - **Redundant Reason**: It doesn’t repeat its statement redundantly.
   - **Weak Causal Basis**: The causal link is extremely weak; existence of reality is too broad to justify crime causation.
   - **Misapplied Reason**: The reason ('because reality exists') seems misapplied because it does not logically or contextually connect to crime.

    **Rating for Weak or Groundless Reasons**: 75
    *Justification*: The reason given is both groundless and inappropriate, failing to establish a direct or reasonable connection between reality and crime. The causal basis is tenuous at best.

3. **Faulty Proofs of the Reason**:
   - **Dilemma Misuse**: No misuse of dilemmas is present.
   - **Misapplication of Signs**: Doesn't misuse signs.
   - **Peripheral Disputes**: Not applicable.
   - **Banality**: The argument is vague but not banal.
   - **False Universals**: This phrase implies an absolute ('reality is why crime exists'), which isn't necessarily true or proven.
   - **Belated Arguments**: Timing is not an issue in this context.
   - **Misleading Defenses**: The statement could be seen as misleading because it doesn’t logically hold up.
   - **Double-Edged Phrases**: The phrase could have dual interpretations, making it potentially problematic.
   - **Misleading Definitions**: This includes misleading or overly general assertions.
   - **Questionable Statements**: The statement presented is highly questionable and lacks evidence.
   - **Inconsistent Reasoning**: There's no internal contradiction apparent in this single statement.
   - **Hostile Addressing**: Not directly applicable.
   - **Incomplete Proofs**: The proof of the reason is entirely absent.

    **Rating for Faulty Proofs of the Reason**: 80
    *Justification*: The statement is a false universal, misleading, and presents a questionable assertion without proof. It heavily lacks substantiation and clear logical framing.

4. **Faulty Embellishments**:
   - **Inexact Similes**: Not applicable.
   - **Unsupported Examples**: Lacks examples entirely.
   - **Misapplied Judgements**: Doesn’t reference previous judgments.
   - **Unnecessary Establishments**: There aren't points needing unnecessary proof.
   - **Amplification Errors**: Doesn’t amplify anything.
   - **Incomplete Summaries**: Not directly applicable.

    **Rating for Faulty Embellishments**: 90
    *Justification*: While not loaded with embellishments, the argument fails entirely in terms of supporting evidence, making its foundational claim highly defective.

### Final Rating and Overall Justification:
**Overall Rating**: 75
*Overall Justification*: The argument "The reason why you do crime is because reality exists" is severely defective on multiple fronts. It presents an inappropriate and groundless reason, fails to prove its reason suitably, and suggests a false universal claim. The logical connection between reality’s existence and criminal behavior is both exceedingly vague and misleading, making it a highly unsound argument.
