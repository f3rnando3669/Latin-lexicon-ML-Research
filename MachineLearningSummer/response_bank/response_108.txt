Using the detailed breakdown in <RB>, here are the three worst types of defective arguments identified within the statement <SP>:

### 1. **Generalization**
**Explanation:** The statement makes broad, sweeping generalizations about the nature of Fortune.
   - **Example in <SP>:** 
     - "The goddess Fortune is blind and stupid." This statement presumes to characterize Fortune entirely based on selected attributes without supporting evidence. It overlooks any complexity or variability in what "Fortune" could mean in different contexts or interpretations.

### 2. **Inappropriate Reason**
**Explanation:** The reasoning used to support the claims in <SP> is not appropriately justified or relevant.
   - **Example in <SP>:** 
     - "She is blind, for that she fails wholly to perceive whereto she attaches herself." This is an inappropriate reason as the blindness of Fortune is inferred in a highly abstract or metaphorical sense without clear logical grounding.
     - "She is stupid because she knows not how to tell worthy from unworthy." This is also an inappropriate reason as it assumes a human-like judgment criterion for an abstract concept without concrete evidence.

### 3. **Questionable Statements**
**Explanation:** The claims made are dubious and lack a solid basis.
   - **Example in <SP>:** 
     - "She is blind, for that she fails wholly to perceive whereto she attaches herself." This statement is highly questionable because it implies that Fortune can and should have perceptual abilities akin to a sentient being, which is not a universally accepted premise.
     - "She is stupid because she knows not how to tell worthy from unworthy." This is another questionable statement as it anthropomorphizes an abstract concept and makes unfounded assumptions about its abilities and processes.

Addressing these issues involves providing a more nuanced and supported analysis or reframing the argument to avoid these types of fallacies.
