For inappropriate_reason.txt
Given <SP> ("One must avoid the sun because it is far away from us."), I'll evaluate it against the fallacies listed in <RB> and score the three worst types of defective arguments.

1. **Inappropriate Reason** (Score: 90/100)
   
   Why it fits: The reasoning provided for avoiding the sun—"because it is far away from us"—does not logically support the advice given. The distance of the sun from Earth has no direct bearing on whether it should be avoided or not. A valid reason might involve the sun's harmful UV rays, not its distance.

2. **Groundless Reason** (Score: 85/100)

   Why it fits: The statement gives a reason for avoiding the sun that lacks any basis. There is no logical connection or evidence showing that the sun's distance necessitates avoidance. Valid reasons usually align with scientific or practical considerations (e.g., avoiding sun exposure due to UV radiation).

3. **Weak Causal Basis** (Score: 80/100)

   Why it fits: The causal relationship implied here (distance of the sun causing the need for avoidance) is extremely weak and unfounded. There's no cause-and-effect logic that explains why the distance of an astronomical body should lead to the conclusion that it must be avoided. The argument doesn't establish a cause that would reasonably lead to the stated effect.

### Summary
- **Inappropriate Reason** (90/100): The given reason has no logical connection to the advice.
- **Groundless Reason** (85/100): The reason provided lacks any substantial basis or evidence.
- **Weak Causal Basis** (80/100): The implied causality is weak and unsubstantiated. 

These scores highlight how the argument in <SP> heavily relies on reasoning that lacks connection, evidence, and logical causality, making it highly defective.
