To rate the arguments in <SP> according to the condensed rulebook <RB>, we will analyze the structure and content step by step. Here's the structured analysis:

### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. **Introduction (Exordium)**
- **Assessment**: There is no explicit introduction in <SP> that prepares the audience or sets the context clearly.
- **Justification**: A score might be lower here due to the lack of a clear introduction.
- **Rating**: 10/100

#### 2. **Statement of Facts (Narratio)**
- **Assessment**: The statement of facts is somewhat present but it's densely theoretical and not entirely clear.
- **Justification**: The clarity and plausibility are compromised by complex jargon, making it hard to follow.
- **Rating**: 30/100

#### 3. **Division (Partitio)**
- **Assessment**: There is no clear enumeration of points or definition of contested issues.
- **Justification**: This absence makes it difficult to see a structured division of arguments.
- **Rating**: 20/100

#### 4. **Proof (Confirmatio)**
- **Assessment**: The argument provides some proofs on shifting views of power and hegemony but lacks concrete evidence.
- **Justification**: It is theoretical with abstract concepts without clear supporting evidence.
- **Rating**: 40/100

#### 5. **Refutation (Refutatio)**
- **Assessment**: There is no direct refutation of opposing arguments presented within <SP>.
- **Justification**: This significantly impacts the effectiveness of the argument.
- **Rating**: 10/100

#### 6. **Conclusion (Peroratio)**
- **Assessment**: The conclusion is mostly absent; it trails off without recapping or amplifying points effectively.
- **Justification**: No summary or final appeal is witnessed.
- **Rating**: 10/100

### Invention Skills
- **Invention**: Theoretical knowledge is evident but practical applications or examples are sparse.
- **Arrangement**: The structure isn't logically clear.
- **Style**: The language is complex and may not adapt to the audience effectively.
- **Memory**: Not applicable for written text analysis.
- **Delivery**: Also not applicable for written text analysis.

### Argument Structure
- **Proposition**: What is to be proved remains somewhat abstract.
- **Reason**: Reasons are provided but lack clarity and focus.
- **Proof of the Reason**: Specific supporting details are missing.
- **Embellishment**: Theoretical complexity might act as embellishment, but does not aid clarity.
- **Résumé**: Lacks a necessary concise summary.

### Identification of Defective Arguments
- **Faults**:
  - **Inappropriate Reasoning**: Reasoning is obfuscated by theoretical jargon.
  - **Lack of Consistency**: The argument seems internally consistent theoretically, but lacks clarity.
  - **Disjointed Structure**: The structure is difficult to discern, affecting logical flow.

### Commonplace Techniques
- **Amplification Techniques**: Effective use of theoretical frameworks but needs better practical illustration.
- **Appeal to Emotions**: None present; the argument is purely intellectual without emotional appeal.

### Overall Rating Calculation
Combining the individual ratings and considering the weight of each segment:
- Introduction: 10
- Statement of Facts: 30
- Division: 20
- Proof: 40
- Refutation: 10
- Conclusion: 10

**Average Rating**: (10 + 30 + 20 + 40 + 10 + 10) / 6 = 20

So, the average rating for how defective the arguments in <SP> are is approximately **20/100**. This low score reflects the absence of clear structure, clarity, and compelling evidence as required by the standards set forth in <RB>.
