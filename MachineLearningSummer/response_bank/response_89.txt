For incomplete_enum.txt
Sure, let's apply each type of defective argument from the *Rhetorica Rulebook* to the statement "People only die of old age or illness" and score it out of 100 for the extent to which it represents or contains that type of defective argument (0 = not at all, 100 = fully illustrative). 

1. **Faulty Proposition** - 100: This statement generalizes that all deaths are caused by old age or illness and ignores other causes.
  
2. **Impossible Generalizations** - 90: It incorrectly implies that death due to other causes such as accidents or violence is impossible.

3. **Incomplete Enumeration** - 100: It enumerates only old age and illness as causes of death, omitting others like accidents or homicide.

4. **False Enumeration** - 100: The statement falsely presents that there are only two possibilities for causes of death.

5. **Tracing Too Far Back** - 0: The statement does not overly complicate by tracing back unnecessary causes.

6. **Inappropriate Reason** - 80: It could be interpreted as offering a weak or groundless reason by only mentioning old age and illness without considering other causes.

7. **Circular Reasoning** - 10: It does not necessarily repeat the same idea in the reason and proposition.

8. **Adequacy in Reason** - 100: The reasoning is not strong enough and fails to fully support the exclusion of other causes of death.

9. **Misapplied Reason** - 80: The reason that people die only of old age and illness could fit various scenarios but does not comprehensively support the proposition.

10. **Rebuttable Dilemma** - 90: It can be easily rebutted by listing other evident causes of death.

11. **Misapplied Sign** - 70: It could be misleading by implying exclusivity based on a false dichotomy.

12. **Banal Defense** - 60: The reasoning may be seen as overly simplistic, as the real world presents more complexity in causes of death.

13. **Universal Agreement** - 0: There is no assumption of universal agreement; rather, the statement declares a fact.

14. **Retrospective Reasoning** - 10: It does not seem to rely on an occurrence after the fact.

15. **Manifest Transgression** - 0: The statement itself isn't defending an unquestionably wrong position.

16. **Ambiguous Statements** - 90: It is ambiguous because "only" can be debated and interpreted differently.

17. **False Definitions** - 100: It incorrectly defines the causes of death, omitting various other valid causes.

18. **Disputed Proof** - 90: It uses an assertion that can be highly disputed with ample counter-examples.

19. **Unsettled Controversy** - 90: The main point of the controversy (other causes of death) is inadequately addressed.

20. **Self-Contradiction** - 0: There is no internal contradiction within the statement.

21. **Inconsistency with the Audience** - 90: This can be highly inconsistent with what audiences know about accidental, violent, and other forms of death.

22. **Unfulfilled Promises** - 80: It promises a definite scope of causes but fails to fulfill an exhaustive account by ignoring others.

23. **Changing the Subject** - 0: The statement does not change the subject; it consistently talks about the causes of death.

24. **Faulty Disparagement** - 10: It does not disparage a whole field but could be seen as undermining the understanding of other death causes.

25. **Crime Identification** - 10: There is no crime identification within this statement.

26. **Unbalanced Comparison** - 100: It fails to balance and consider other causes of death.

27. **Disparaging When Unnecessary** - 0: It is not disparaging any element unnecessarily.

28. **Controversy on Names** - 0: It doesn’t argue over terminologies or names.

29. **Faulty Simile** - 0: It does not use a simile.

30. **False Example** - 100: The statement can be seen as a false example of what leads to death.

31. **Invalid Previous Judgements** - 90: It can be seen as following invalid generalizations of causes of death, ignoring ample evidence to the contrary.

32. **Redundant Proof** - 0: The statement doesn’t prove already admitted facts.

33. **Unbacked Amplification** - 90: It amplifies the point without a substantial backup that other causes don't exist.

34. **Incomplete Résumé** - 70: The enumeration is incomplete and misleading, failing to cover the spectrum of causes of death.

This gives you a clear assessment of the statement "People only die of old age or illness" according to the different types of defective arguments as classified in the *Rhetorica Rulebook*.
