Let's analyze the statement "You must avoid medical doctors when ill because otherwise you will become lazy" according to the types of defective arguments outlined in Cicero's **"Rhetorica ad Herennium"**. Here's the breakdown with a score out of 100 for how strongly each type of defective argument applies:

1. **Generalization**: 30 - It doesn't generalize from a specific instance explicitly, but implies a general conclusion without evidence.
2. **Impossibility**: 10 - Doesn't declare a rare occurrence as impossible.
3. **Incomplete Enumeration**: 20 - It implies only one consequence of visiting doctors, but it's more of a false causation.
4. **False Enumeration**: 50 - Ignores many other consequences of visiting doctors, focusing exclusively on "laziness.”
5. **Remote Tracing**: 10 - It doesn't trace the origin of the argument unnecessarily far back.
6. **Inappropriate Reason**: 90 - The reason given (laziness) is not logically connected to the proposition (avoid doctors).
7. **Groundless Reason**: 100 - "Becoming lazy" is a false reason that lacks tangible evidence.
8. **Redundant Reason**: 20 - Not merely rephrasing the original proposition.
9. **Weak Causal Basis**: 80 - Offers a very weak causal link between visiting doctors and becoming lazy.
10. **Misapplied Reason**: 70 - Uses an irrelevant reason without proper justification.
11. **Dilemma Misuse**: 10 - There is no use of a dilemma here.
12. **Misapplication of Signs**: 50 - Misapplies the concept of “laziness” as a sign of visiting doctors.
13. **Peripheral Disputes**: 20 - Doesn't fit under this category.
14. **Banality**: 30 - "Laziness" as a reason can be considered a banal excuse, but not overused in this context.
15. **False Universals**: 75 - Assumes a universally agreed viewpoint without proof.
16. **Belated Arguments**: 10 - The argument timing isn’t relevant here.
17. **Misleading Defenses**: 60 - Uses "laziness" as a pretext to avoid visiting doctors.
18. **Double-Edged Phrases**: 40 - Can be interpreted in multiple, potentially harmful ways.
19. **Misleading Definitions**: 70 - Misleadingly defines the consequence of visiting doctors.
20. **Questionable Statements**: 80 - Assertion about laziness is unproven.
21. **Inconsistent Reasoning**: 30 - While faulty, it doesn't contradict itself.
22. **Hostile Addressing**: 40 - Might go against the beliefs of an audience who trust doctors.
23. **Incomplete Proofs**: 90 - No substantive evidence is provided for the claim.
24. **Topic Shifting**: 30 - Stays on topic but with faulty reasoning.
25. **Fault by Association**: 50 - Discredits medical practitioners by associating them with laziness.
26. **Evidence Mix-Up**: 80 - Misidentifies the cause of laziness without concrete evidence.
27. **Biased Comparisons**: 40 - Implicitly makes a biased comparison to non-doctor interventions.
28. **Name Disputes**: 10 - No naming conventions involved.
29. **Inexact Similes**: 50 - Simile between visiting doctors and becoming lazy is imprecise.
30. **Unsupported Examples**: 70 - Lacks proper justifications or examples.
31. **Misapplied Judgements**: 60 - Misuses judgment about doctors' effects.
32. **Unnecessary Establishments**: 60 - Tries to establish a point not inherently controversial without proper arguments.
33. **Amplification Errors**: 70 - Amplifies laziness without substantiation.
34. **Incomplete Summaries**: 60 - Summarizes without covering all required parts.

Analyzing <SP> comprehensively, it heavily relies on **Inappropriate Reason**, **Groundless Reason**, **False Universals**, **Incomplete Proofs**, and **Evidence Mix-Up** as the most defective types of arguments among others.
