To rate how defective the arguments in <SP> are based on the guidelines provided in **"Rhetorica ad Herennium"** (summarized in <RB>), we will evaluate each statement and reasoning step by step.

### Step-by-Step Evaluation:

1. **Statement**: "I was in church from 9pm to 11pm on Sunday."
   - **Assessment**: This statement is straightforward and factual (assuming it's true). No defective argument is present here.
   - **Defective Rating**: 0/100

2. **Reason**: "My church is very far from my house."
   - **Assessment**: This statement is still factual but introduces a claim about the distance, which could be subject to verification. If not substantiated, it could be seen as a **Groundless Reason** if it fails scrutiny.
   - **Defective Rating**: 20/100

3. **Conclusion**: "Thus, I cannot hear any sounds from my house."
   - **Assessment**: 
     - This can be perceived as a **Weak Causal Basis** since the ability to hear sounds depends on several factors, not only distance (e.g., volume of the scream, environmental noise levels, etc.).
     - Could also be seen as **Inappropriate Reason** if not enough context is provided on why distance absolutely precludes hearing sounds.
   - **Defective Rating**: 40/100

4. **Contradictory Statement**: "I heard a scream from my house at 10:30pm on Sunday."
   - **Assessment**: This directly contradicts the prior conclusion that one cannot hear sounds from the house due to distance.
     - This is a clear case of **Inconsistent Reasoning** since the previous argument about the inability to hear sounds is now contradicted.
     - Can also be seen as a **False Enumeration** as it overlooks potential intermediary factors like echo or other means of hearing a scream.
   - **Defective Rating**: 80/100

5. **Conclusion**: "Hence, I called the police."
   - **Assessment**: 
     - Given the defective reasoning already indicated, this conclusion stands on a shaky foundation.
     - It also implies a certain urgency and logic without addressing the contradictions in previous statements, guiding to **Misleading Defenses** if attempting to cover up flaws in the previous reasons.
     - May also count as **Peripheral Disputes**, shifting what should be focus on weak argumentation towards the action taken.
   - **Defective Rating**: 70/100

### Overall Rating:

Given the assessment of each part of the argument in <SP>, the overall defectiveness rating can be calculated as the average of individual evaluations:

- **(0 + 20 + 40 + 80 + 70) / 5 = 42**

However, because the contradiction in step 4 is particularly severe (80/100 rating), it should have a higher weight in influencing the overall score. Therefore, considering a weighted average might be more appropriate:

\[ \text{Weighted Average} = \frac{(0 + 20 + 40 + 80 \times 2 + 70)}{6} = \frac{290}{6} \approx 48.3 \]

### Final Defective Rating: 48/100

Despite the earlier steps having reasonable parts, the critical inconsistency in step 4 significantly magnifies the overall defectiveness. This contradiction undermines the credibility of the argument as a whole. Thus, an overall rating of 48/100 highlights substantial defects primarily due to the inconsistency in the reasoning.
