To properly evaluate and rate the defective arguments present in <SP>, we'll dissect each step and compare it to the defective argument categories outlined in <RB>.

### Step 1: 
**Proposal: We know that a circle is a loci of points equidistant from a centre.**
- **Accuracy**: This is a mathematically accurate definition of a circle.
- **Defect Rating**: 10/100 
  - This statement is correct and clear, with minimal grounds for being defective.

### Step 2: 
**Proposal: We also know that yesterday was a point in time.**
- **Accuracy**: While it's commonly understood, this metaphorical statement suggests treating "yesterday" as a spatial point.
- **Defect Rating**: 30/100
  - Category: **Misleading Definitions** (from Faulty Proof of the Reason)
    - Treating time as a spatial point lacks precision, potentially misleading the audience.

### Step 3: 
**Reason: Thus, because a point can be a centre there is a circle around the time.**
- **Logical Soundness**: This attempts to analogously extend spatial concepts (points and circles) to temporal concepts without proper justification.
- **Defect Rating**: 80/100
  - Category: **Groundless Reason** and **False Universals** (from Faulty Proofs of the Reason)
    - There's no logical basis for assuming that spatial properties apply directly to time.
    - Groundless Reason: No evidence that a temporal point functions as a spatial center.

### Step 4: 
**Conclusion: Hence, time has a perimeter and area.**
- **Logical Soundness**: This conclusion builds on the flawed reasoning in the previous step and therefore is logically unsound.
- **Defect Rating**: 90/100
  - Category: **Inappropriate Reason**, **Weak Causal Basis**, and **Redundant Reason** 
    - Misapplying spatial properties to temporal concepts without substantial evidence.
    - Furthermore, this assertion repeats the argument in different words without additional supporting evidence.

### Summary:
The reasoning quickly diverges into logically unsound territory after the initial definitions are laid out:

1. Step 1: Accurate definition (10/100)
2. Step 2: Metaphorical and somewhat misleading (30/100)
3. Step 3: Groundless and problematic analogy (80/100)
4. Step 4: Unsound conclusion based on prior faulty reasoning (90/100)

**Overall Defect Rating**: Calculates to an approximate average defect rating for the sequence of 52.5/100. However, given the way argument defects accumulate, an effective weighting might place the overall rating closer to the highest contributing defective elements, resulting in a higher combined defect rating of around **70/100**. This considers the escalating logical errors that undermine the overall argument's coherence and soundness.
