Let's evaluate the statement using the defective arguments criteria from Cicero's "Rhetorica ad Herennium":

1. **Generalization**: The statement claims that life is ruled by Blind Fortune or Accident without substantial evidence, but it is not an overly broad generalization. Score: 40/100
2. **Impossibility**: The statement does not declare anything impossible that is unlikely. Score: 0/100
3. **Incomplete Enumeration**: The statement considers only "Fortune" or "Blind Accident" without mentioning other possibilities like personal choice, luck, etc. Score: 60/100
4. **False Enumeration**: It presents only two possibilities when there may be more. Score: 70/100
5. **Remote Tracing**: The statement's general assumption does not trace origins unnecessarily. Score: 10/100
6. **Inappropriate Reason**: The reason given for the belief in Blind Accident might not logically support the claim ("proved by the actual experience of life"). Score: 60/100
7. **Groundless Reason**: "Proven by actual experience of life" lacks concrete evidence or examples. Score: 80/100
8. **Redundant Reason**: The reasoning doesn’t restate the proposition in different terms. Score: 10/100
9. **Weak Causal Basis**: The evidence provided ("Orestes now was king, and now became a beggar") is anecdotal and weak. Score: 70/100
10. **Misapplied Reason**: The examples don't support varied points; they only emphasize the main claim. Score: 10/100
11. **Dilemma Misuse**: No dilemma present. Score: 0/100
12. **Misapplication of Signs**: "Blind Accident" representing all life experiences is an overgeneralization. Score: 50/100
13. **Peripheral Disputes**: The example does not directly dispute the central claim. Score: 30/100
14. **Banality**: The excuse isn't overused in this context. Score: 20/100
15. **False Universals**: It implies universally agreed points without proof. "Life is ruled by fortune" is a broad, unchecked assumption. Score: 80/100
16. **Belated Arguments**: Argument is presented timely in the discourse. Score: 20/100
17. **Misleading Defenses**: The defense is the primary claim, not a pretext. Score: 30/100
18. **Double-Edged Phrases**: Not susceptible to dual interpretations in this context. Score: 20/100
19. **Misleading Definitions**: No definition is explicitly provided. Score: 20/100
20. **Questionable Statements**: Assumptions without sufficient proof, akin to "questionable statements." Score: 70/100
21. **Inconsistent Reasoning**: The reasoning is consistent within the flawed framework. Score: 30/100
22. **Hostile Addressing**: Not addressed to an audience in a hostile manner. Score: 10/100
23. **Incomplete Proofs**: Fails to substantiate the claim fully. Score: 80/100
24. **Topic Shifting**: Stays consistent with the main topic—Fortune or Accident ruling life. Score: 20/100
25. **Fault by Association**: Does not disparage a field by practitioners' faults. Score: 10/100
26. **Evidence Mix-Up**: Evidence is presented but not convincingly. Score: 50/100
27. **Biased Comparisons**: Comparing Orestes’ fate to a universal truth can be seen as a biased comparison. Score: 60/100
28. **Name Disputes**: No disputes over naming conventions. Score: 10/100
29. **Inexact Similes**: Uses specific examples (Orestes) to generalize—potentially inexact. Score: 60/100
30. **Unsupported Examples**: Examples are weak and potentially inappropriate. Score: 70/100
31. **Misapplied Judgements**: Irrelevant judgments about life experiences and fortune. Score: 50/100
32. **Unnecessary Establishments**: Tries to prove points that may not need establishing. Score: 50/100
33. **Amplification Errors**: Amplifies a point that should be proven rather than assumed. Score: 70/100
34. **Incomplete Summaries**: The summary of arguments is not complete or convincing. Score: 80/100

Summary: The statement scores high in several defective argument categories, particularly in generalization, incomplete enumeration, false enumeration, groundless reason, weak causal basis, false universals, questionable statements, incomplete proofs, biased comparisons, unsupported examples, amplification errors, and incomplete summaries. This assessment suggests that the statement is fundamentally weak and relies heavily on subjective, unsupported claims.
