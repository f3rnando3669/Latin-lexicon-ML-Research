Let's analyze <SP> step by step using <RB> and provide a rating for the defectiveness of the arguments.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### Argument 1:
- **My grandfather was a lumberjack. That is why I know how to bake a bread.**

**Justification:**
- **Reasoning Faults**: This argument is highly defective because the occupation of the speaker's grandfather (being a lumberjack) has no logical connection to the speaker's ability to bake bread.
- **Lack of Consistency and Relevance**: There is no direct correlation or causal link provided that connects lumberjack activities to baking skills.

**Rating**: 95/100 (Highly defective due to irrelevant and weak reasoning)

#### Argument 2:
- **I was in church from 9pm to 11pm on Sunday. My church is very far from my house. Thus, I cannot hear any sounds from my house.**

**Justification:**
- **Causal Relation**: This argument is relatively sound because it establishes a logical connection between the speaker's location (church) and their inability to hear sounds from their house due to distance.
- **Clear Proposition and Reasoning**: The proposition ("I cannot hear any sounds from my house") is well-supported by the reason ("church is very far from my house").

**Rating**: 10/100 (Mostly non-defective with a clear logical structure)

#### Argument 3:
- **I heard a scream from my house at 10:30pm on Sunday. Hence, I called the police.**

**Justification:**
- **Inconsistency**: This argument directly contradicts the previous argument where the speaker claimed they couldn't hear sounds from their house because they were at the church, which was far away.
- **Lack of Credibility**: Given the earlier statement, the claim of hearing a scream at 10:30pm when supposedly in church undermines the argument's credibility and logical consistency.

**Rating**: 90/100 (Highly defective due to inconsistency and lack of credibility)

### Summary
- **Argument 1**: 95/100
- **Argument 2**: 10/100
- **Argument 3**: 90/100

**Overall Defectiveness Rating**: To provide a composite rating, we can average the defectiveness ratings.

\[ \text{Overall Defectiveness} = \frac{95 + 10 + 90}{3} = \frac{195}{3} = 65 \]

**Overall Justification**:
- **Argument 1** and **Argument 3** show high levels of defectiveness due to weak, irrelevant reasoning, and internal inconsistency, respectively.
- **Argument 2** is mostly sound but is compromised by the issues in **Argument 3**.

Thus, the overall defectiveness rating for <SP> is **65/100**.
