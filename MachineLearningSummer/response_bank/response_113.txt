To evaluate the statement "Anything you can put in your mouth is good for you," we'll apply the criteria and fallacies outlined in <RB> and assess them. Here are the worst three types of defective arguments found in <SP>, along with scores out of 100 (lower scores indicate more flawed reasoning):

### 1. False Universals
- **Description**: This fallacy is about making an overly broad assertion that doesn't hold true in all circumstances. The statement "Anything you can put in your mouth is good for you" is a classic example of an over-generalization, overlooking substances that are harmful or toxic when ingested.
- **Examples from <RB>**: "Everybody knows that all politicians lie." "It's a universal truth that money can't buy happiness."
- **Score**: 20/100
- **Reasoning**: The statement makes a blanket assertion that ignores the vast array of harmful substances, ranging from toxins to allergens, that one could put in their mouth. This over-generalization is highly misleading and dangerous.

### 2. Groundless Reason
- **Description**: This type of fallacy provides a reason that lacks evidence or justification. In <SP>, the assertion that "Anything you can put in your mouth is good for you" is not substantiated by any evidence or logical reasoning.
- **Examples from <RB>**: "Studying history is pointless because it fills your head with useless dates." "Investing in stocks is useless because the market always crashes."
- **Score**: 15/100
- **Reasoning**: The statement provides a conclusion about the safety and benefits of ingesting any substance without offering any supporting evidence. This makes the argument baseless and highly questionable.

### 3. Incomplete Enumeration
- **Description**: Incomplete enumeration involves presenting a limited set of options or factors, ignoring other possibilities. The statement "Anything you can put in your mouth is good for you" implies a gross simplification, overlooking the diversity of things one could ingest.
- **Examples from <RB>**: "Trees are either oaks or pines," ignoring other tree species. "Energy sources are just coal or solar," ignoring other forms of energy.
- **Score**: 25/100
- **Reasoning**: The statement fails to enumerate the vast range of harmful substances one might ingest. It simplifies the intricate topic of ingesting substances by ignoring harmful or neutral items, which can be potentially life-threatening.

### Summary of Scores and Justifications:
1. **False Universals**: 20/100
2. **Groundless Reason**: 15/100
3. **Incomplete Enumeration**: 25/100

These scores reflect the severity of the fallacies within the statement, with lower scores indicating more egregious reasoning errors. The evaluated argument in <SP> exemplifies dangerous over-generalizations, baseless claims, and gross oversimplifications, making it a highly defective argument from a critical thinking perspective.
