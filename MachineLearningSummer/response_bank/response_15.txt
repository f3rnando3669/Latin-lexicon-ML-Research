Sure, let's evaluate the argument in <SP> step by step according to the guidelines in <RB> and provide a rating on a scale from 1 to 100.

### Step-by-Step Evaluation:

#### Premise 1: If your blood is blue, then you are smart.

1. **Faulty Proposition: Generalization**
   - **Rating: 70/100**: This premise utilizes a sweeping generalization that associating the color of one's blood with intelligence. It fails to consider exceptions or varying instances, making it a generalization.

2. **Faulty Proposition: Impossibility**
   - **Rating: 80/100**: This statement could be challenged as declaring an impressive trait based on an impossible real-world condition (human blood is not blue when oxygenated; it may appear blue in veins due to light absorption but fundamentally is not blue).

3. **Faulty Evidence**
   - **Rating: 90/100**: There is no scientific evidence to support a correlation between blood color and smartness, making the argument groundless and subject to easy refutation.

#### Premise 2: Your blood is blue.

1. **Faulty Proposition: Impossibility**
   - **Rating: 100/100**: Since human blood is never actually blue, this assertion is patently false within the context of human biology, making it an impossible proposition.

#### Conclusion: You must be smart.

1. **Weak or Groundless Reason: Redundant Reason**
   - **Rating: 85/100**: This conclusion rests on the previous faulty premise that the blood color determines intelligence, making it an extension of the same flawed logic.
   
2. **Faulty Proofs of the Reason: False Universals**
   - **Rating: 80/100**: This reasoning falls under false universals as it presupposes universal agreement on an unproven and incorrect assertion about blood color and intelligence.

### Overall Defective Argument Rating:

Combining the evaluations, the overall defective argument in <SP> ranks high due to multiple logical fallacies, primarily grounded in impossibility and unsupported propositions. Hence, the final rating will be adjusted for an average of significant defects noted.

**Final Rating: 90/100**

**Justification**: The rating justified by evaluating each premise and conclusion reveals major flaws such as impossibility, groundless generalization, redundant reasoning, and false universals. This high defect score indicates the argument is profoundly flawed and easily refuted.
