For incomplete_enum.txt
To evaluate the argument "People only die of old age or illness" using the criteria in the <RB>, we'll break it down step by step and assign a rating for each type of defective argument. 

### Step-by-Step Evaluation

1. **Faulty Propositions**

   - **Generalization**:
     This statement generalizes the causes of death to only old age and illness, which is not true. People can die from accidents, violence, natural disasters, poisoning, etc.
     **Rating: 95/100**
     **Justification**: It is highly defective due to gross over-generalization, ignoring many other causes of death.

   - **Impossibility**:
     Implying that it is impossible to die from anything other than old age or illness is incorrect.
     **Rating: 85/100**
     **Justification**: The statement declares an impossibility which is factually incorrect.

   - **Incomplete Enumeration**:
     Fails to acknowledge the complete list of possible causes of death, such as accidents, suicides, murders, etc.
     **Rating: 90/100**
     **Justification**: It notably presents an incomplete enumeration of death causes, missing out on several significant factors.

   - **False Enumeration**:
     Similarly, it suggests a false enumeration by implying these two causes cover all possibilities of death.
     **Rating: 85/100**
     **Justification**: The enumeration given is false and misleading.

   - **Remote Tracing**:
     This statement doesn't involve remote tracing. 
     **Rating: Not applicable**

2. **Weak or Groundless Reasons**

   - **Inappropriate Reason**:
     Doesn't apply in this context as the statement itself is a claim, not a reason supporting a proposition.
     **Rating: Not applicable**

   - **Groundless Reason**:
     The statement is groundless as it is not supported by any evidence or logical reasoning.
     **Rating: 90/100**
     **Justification**: The claim is made without any grounding in supporting data or factual basis.

   - **Redundant Reason**:
     Not applicable, it isn't a redundant repetition.
     **Rating: Not applicable**

   - **Weak Causal Basis**:
     The basis of attributing death solely to old age or illness is weak given the numerous other documented causes of death.
     **Rating: 80/100**
     **Justification**: The causal basis provided is weak compared to the reality of multiple causes of death.

   - **Misapplied Reason**:
     Not applicable here in the formulation of the statement.
     **Rating: Not applicable**

3. **Faulty Proofs of the Reason**

   - **Dilemma Misuse**:
     Not applicable in this context.
     **Rating: Not applicable**

   - **Misapplication of Signs**:
     Not applicable here, as the statement is not dealing with signs.
     **Rating: Not applicable**

   - **Peripheral Disputes**:
     The argument might trigger debates ancillary to the central topic of death but is not a direct peripheral dispute.
     **Rating: Not applicable**

   - **Banality**:
     The argument is somewhat banal given the multitude of discussed death causes.
     **Rating: 75/100**
     **Justification**: The simplicity of old age and illness as causes skirts around deeper discussions of mortality.

   - **False Universals**:
     Asserts a universal claim without proof warranting death causes.
     **Rating: 90/100**
     **Justification**: It falsely universalizes death's causes.

   - **Belated Arguments**:
     Not applicable.
     **Rating: Not applicable**

     Gives a misleading definition of death causes.
