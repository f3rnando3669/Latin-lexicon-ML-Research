Let's analyze <SP> for defective arguments using the identified fallacies from <RB>. We'll score each argument on a scale of 1 to 100, where 100 represents the most egregious level of logical error.

### Analysis of <SP>:

1. **Generalization**:
   - **Argument:** The statement generalizes that stupidity is the root cause of all evils.
   - **Score:** 80
     - This is a strong generalization, as it oversimplifies the complex nature of human behavior and ethical issues, attributing every evil act to stupidity without considering other potential factors.

2. **Weak Causal Basis**:
   - **Argument:** The jump from stupidity to boundless desires, to avarice, and ultimately to crime is a series of causally weak links.
   - **Score:** 90
     - The causation chain lacks solid evidence. While stupidity might lead to some poor decisions, saying it universally leads to boundless desires, avarice, and eventually crime is a broad and unsupported claim.

3. **Incomplete Enumeration**:
   - **Argument:** The argument lists stupidity as the sole cause of evil and avarice as the only driver for crime among adversaries.
   - **Score:** 75
     - The enumeration is incomplete as it excludes other causes of evil and crime, such as social, economic, psychological, and environmental factors.

### Other Notable Fallacies:

4. **False Universals**:
   - **Argument:** The argument implies that avarice "drives men to any crime you will," which is an over-generalized universal statement.
   - **Score:** 70
     - This false universal disregards that not all crimes are committed out of avarice, making the argument overly simplistic.

5. **Hostile Addressing**:
   - **Argument:** The term "adversaries" is used in a hostile tone, attributing the crime to them without a detailed examination.
   - **Score:** 60
     - This weakens the argument by using an adversarial and accusatory approach without substantial evidence.

## Scoring Summary for the Worst 3 Types:

1. **Weak Causal Basis** – 90/100
2. **Generalization** – 80/100
3. **Incomplete Enumeration** – 75/100

These types of fallacies significantly undermine the argument in <SP>, making it weak by failing to provide a strong, logical, and comprehensive basis for its claims.
