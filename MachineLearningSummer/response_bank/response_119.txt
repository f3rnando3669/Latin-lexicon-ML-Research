Analyzing the argument in <SP> ("You must avoid medical doctors when ill because otherwise you will become lazy."), we can identify several types of defective arguments from the list provided. The worst types found in this example are:

1. **Inappropriate Reason**:
   - **Score: 95/100**
   - **Explanation**: The reasoning given for avoiding medical doctors—"because otherwise you will become lazy"—is entirely inappropriate. The primary concern when ill should be effective treatment and health recovery, not an unrelated and speculative outcome such as becoming lazy. This reasoning is irrelevant and detracts from a genuine health concern.

2. **False Enumeration**:
   - **Score: 90/100**
   - **Explanation**: This argument falsely presents the situation as having only two outcomes: seeing a doctor and potentially becoming lazy or not seeing a doctor and presumably maintaining diligence. It oversimplifies the complexity of health care decisions and fails to acknowledge other crucial factors and possible outcomes.

3. **Groundless Reason**:
   - **Score: 85/100**
   - **Explanation**: The claim that seeing a medical doctor when ill will cause laziness is baseless and unsupported. There is no substantial evidence or logical foundation for such a connection; thus, it doesn't hold up under scrutiny.

These fallacies significantly weaken the argument due to their irrelevance, false dichotomy, and lack of substantiation, thus receiving high scores indicating severe flaws.
