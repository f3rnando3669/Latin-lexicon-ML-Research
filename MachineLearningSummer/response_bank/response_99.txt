For impossibility.txt
Sure, let's systematically evaluate <SP> ("No one can graduate from university before the age of 19.") against each type of defective argument listed. Each type will be scored out of 100 based on how applicable it is to the given statement.

1. **Generalization**: 90 - This statement makes a broad claim about everyone without considering exceptions.
2. **Impossibility**: 80 - It suggests an absolute impossibility without proof, though rare, there may be prodigies.
3. **Incomplete Enumeration**: 60 - It ignores possible scenarios where someone might graduate earlier due to exceptional circumstances.
4. **False Enumeration**: 50 - It posits a binary situation falsely (elder graduates only).
5. **Remote Tracing**: 20 - This isn’t as applicable here since it does not trace the cause to a remote or irrelevant place.
6. **Inappropriate Reason**: 70 - Suggesting impossibility without presenting a logical or relevant reason.
7. **Groundless Reason**: 85 - There is no apparent reason provided, making the statement baseless.
8. **Redundant Reason**: 20 - The statement doesn’t contain redundancy.
9. **Weak Causal Basis**: 75 - Suggests an absolute condition without backing evidence.
10. **Misapplied Reason**: 65 - Applying a general age norm as an absolute rule is misapplied reasoning.
11. **Dilemma Misuse**: 60 - Creates a false dilemma between ages and graduation which isn’t justified.
12. **Misapplication of Signs**: 50 - The statement may be interpreted as a misapplied sign if we consider younger achievements.
13. **Peripheral Disputes**: 40 - Less relevant; the statement doesn’t attack peripheral issues directly.
14. **Banality**: 30 - It’s a broad claim without plausible trivial reasoning.
15. **False Universals**: 95 - Uses ‘no one’ as a universal term, clearly a false universal.
16. **Belated Arguments**: 20 - It doesn’t reference a past condition or choice that was too late to change.
17. **Misleading Defenses**: 60 - If used to argue against child prodigies, it is misleading.
18. **Double-Edged Phrases**: 20 - Doesn’t contain contradictory or dual-meaning phrases.
19. **Misleading Definitions**: 70 - Misleading if one interprets it to define intellectual capabilities strictly by age.
20. **Questionable Statements**: 85 - The claim is questionable as numerous prodigies have graduated at younger ages.
21. **Inconsistent Reasoning**: 60 - It may be inconsistent if the speaker elsewhere acknowledges exceptional cases.
22. **Hostile Addressing**: 20 - Doesn’t actively address someone in a hostile manner.
23. **Incomplete Proofs**: 80 - Makes a definitive statement without supporting evidence.
24. **Topic Shifting**: 40 - Doesn’t directly shift the topic but could imply a shift if discussing education norms.
25. **Fault by Association**: 50 - Asserts a broad personal conclusion potentially based on limited observations.
26. **Evidence Mix-Up**: 75 - Lacks distinct evidence that younger people can’t graduate; error of evidence.
27. **Biased Comparisons**: 60 - Implies a bias that only older students can meet educational standards for graduation.
28. **Name Disputes**: 40 - Doesn't revolve around semantic disputes.
29. **Inexact Similes**: 20 - Doesn't use or rely on similes.
30. **Unsupported Examples**: 85 - Provides no supportive examples of younger graduates, so highly applicable.
31. **Misapplied Judgements**: 70 - Uses judgments regarding ages misapplied to graduation capability.
32. **Unnecessary Establishments**: 20 - Not about establishing known facts.
33. **Amplification Errors**: 60 - Amplifies a typical graduate age into an absolute limit.
34. **Incomplete Summaries**: 30 - Doesn’t summarize any complex subject incompletely.
