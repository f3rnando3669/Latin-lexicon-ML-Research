Let's analyze and rate the statement **<SP>** step by step, using **<RB>** as the criteria:

**Statement:** "Those who advocate for environmental protection are clearly against progress and economic development."

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Faulty Propositions:**
   - **Generalization**: The statement makes a sweeping generalization about all environmental advocates being against progress and economic development. This fails to account for the many environmentalists who support sustainable development or eco-innovation.
     - **Rating Justification**: This faulty proposition is highly defective because it assumes a universal truth without sufficient basis.
     - **Rating**: 90

2. **Weak or Groundless Reasons:**
   - **Groundless Reason**: There is no logical reasoning provided to support the claim that environmental protection inherently opposes progress and economic development. Environmental protection can actually drive innovation in green technologies and sustainable practices.
     - **Rating Justification**: The statement presents an assertion without robust evidence or reasoning.
     - **Rating**: 85

3. **Faulty Proofs of the Reason:**
   - **Banality and Peripheral Disputes**: The argument makes an overly simplistic and overused claim, which can be easily countered by numerous examples of environmentally sustainable economic practices.
     - **Rating Justification**: The argument relies on a cliché without addressing nuance or complexity.
     - **Rating**: 80

4. **Faulty Embellishments:**
   - **Inexact Similes**: If there were any embellishments or analogies comparing environmental protection directly to being against development, they would likely be inaccurate and misleading.
     - **Rating Justification**: Although not explicitly stated, if we infer similes or comparisons, they would be untenable.
     - **Rating**: 75

### Overall Rating Calculation:

Considering each category’s rating and its justification, averaging these ratings gives a composite score for the argument's defectiveness.

- Generalization: 90
- Groundless Reason: 85
- Banality and Peripheral Disputes: 80
- Inexact Similes: 75

**Overall Defectiveness Rating:**
(90 + 85 + 80 + 75) / 4 = 82.5

**Round Off to the Nearest Integer: 83**

Thus, the arguments in **<SP>** are rated at **83** out of 100 in terms of defectiveness, with 100 being the worst. This high score indicates that the arguments are highly defective based on Cicero's criteria in **<RB>**.
