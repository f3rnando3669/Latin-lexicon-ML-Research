For generalization.txt
Here are the ratings on a scale of 0 to 100 for each of the potential types of defective arguments, as laid out by the *Rhetorica Rulebook*:

1. **Faulty Proposition**: 90
   - Generalizes the concept of "anything" without exceptions.

2. **Impossible Generalizations**: 90
   - Assumes all things that can be put in the mouth are good, ignoring obvious exceptions like harmful substances.

3. **Incomplete Enumeration**: 85
   - Fails to list things harmful when ingested, assuming the list is complete.

4. **False Enumeration**: 85
   - Provides an insufficient number of categories, excluding harmful substances.

5. **Tracing Too Far Back**: 10
   - The argument does not trace reasons or causes.

6. **Inappropriate Reason**: 85
   - Implies all ingestible things have the intrinsic property of being good without supporting this with valid reasoning.

7. **Circular Reasoning**: 70
   - Implies that ingestible things are good because you can ingest them, without logical progression.

8. **Adequacy in Reason**: 80
   - "Anything you can put in your mouth is good" is a weak reason for "good for you."

9. **Misapplied Reason**: 70
   - Could apply equally to "anything you can sit on is comfortable."

10. **Rebuttable Dilemma**: 65
   - "Good for you" can easily be rebutted by pointing out harmful ingested substances.

11. **Misapplied Sign**: 85
   - Uses being able to ingest as a sign of being good, which is not definitive.

12. **Banal Defense**: 20
   - Argument isn't based on a banal excuse.

13. **Universal Agreement**: 70
   - Sometimes assumes general agreement where there is none.

14. **Retrospective Reasoning**: 20
   - Does not rely on hindsight.

15. **Manifest Transgression**: 85
   - "Anything you can put in your mouth is good for you" is easily transgressable.

16. **Ambiguous Statements**: 75
   - "Good for you" is vague without context.

17. **False Definitions**: 90
   - Defines "anything you can put in your mouth" too broadly and inaccurately.

18. **Disputed Proof**: 85
   - Assumes without proof that all ingestibles are beneficial.

19. **Unsettled Controversy**: 75
   - Controversial claim not settled by the argument itself.

20. **Self-Contradiction**: 40
   - Not internally contradictory but implicitly contradicts common knowledge.

21. **Inconsistency with the Audience**: 85
   - Likely goes against the common understanding of the audience.

22. **Unfulfilled Promises**: 80
   - Does not prove or support its claims appropriately.

23. **Changing the Subject**: 10
   - Stays within the same topic of ingestion and well-being.

24. **Faulty Disparagement**: 10
   - No broad disparagement involved.

25. **Crime Identification**: 10
   - Not related to proving a crime.

26. **Unbalanced Comparison**: 80
   - Fails to balance benefits and harms of ingestibles.

27. **Disparaging When Unnecessary**: 10
   - No disparagement element.

28. **Controversy on Names**: 10
   - Does not involve name changes or titles.

29. **Faulty Simile**: 10
   - No simile used.

30. **False Example**: 85
   - General claim without substantiating examples.

31. **Invalid Previous Judgements**: 70
   - Implicitly relies on a possibly invalid understanding of "good for you."

32. **Redundant Proof**: 70
   - May reiterate already accepted lesser-known categories without stronger proof.

33. **Unbacked Amplification**: 75
   - Amplifies "good for you" without proof.

34. **Incomplete Résumé**: 70
   - Fails to consider negatives sufficiently.

Final score distribution:

- Critical Issues: 70-90%
- Minor Issues: 40-70%
- Not Applicable: 10-40%

Cumulative score: This statement, "Anything you can put in your mouth is good for you," exhibits many of the defective argument types as per *Rhetorica ad Herennium*. It scores high in critical areas indicating that it's highly flawed and unreliable.
