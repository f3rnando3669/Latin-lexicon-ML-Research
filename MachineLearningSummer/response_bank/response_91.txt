Certainly! Using the *Rhetorica ad Herennium* rulebook, I'll evaluate how closely <SP> matches each type of defective argument and provide a score out of 100 for each.

1. **Faulty Proposition**: Very applicable, as it generalizes that going to medical doctors when ill will make everyone lazy.
   - Score: 90/100

2. **Impossible Generalizations**: Not directly applicable as it concerns potential outcomes, not an impossible occurrence.
   - Score: 20/100

3. **Incomplete Enumeration**: Not directly applicable; does not involve listing possibilities.
   - Score: 10/100

4. **False Enumeration**: Similar to Incomplete Enumeration, doesn't provide a list of multiple possibilities.
   - Score: 15/100

5. **Tracing Too Far Back**: There is some tracing of cause and effect (falling ill -> become lazy), though not overly complex.
   - Score: 60/100

6. **Inappropriate Reason**: Strongly applicable as the reason (becoming lazy) does not adequately justify avoiding medical doctors.
   - Score: 80/100

7. **Circular Reasoning**: Doesn’t repeat the proposition; states a sequence (ill -> doctors -> lazy).
   - Score: 30/100

8. **Adequacy in Reason**: Applicable because avoiding medical doctors when ill has a weak justification (becoming lazy).
   - Score: 75/100

9. **Misapplied Reason**: The reason given doesn't fit well with the necessity of seeing medical doctors.
   - Score: 70/100

10. **Rebuttable Dilemma**: Not a dilemma; It's a straightforward assertion.
    - Score: 20/100

11. **Misapplied Sign**: Suggests a weak linkage (seeing doctors -> laziness), though "lazy" can be subjective.
    - Score: 65/100

12. **Banal Defense**: The excuse “become lazy” is somewhat cliché but not overused.
    - Score: 55/100

13. **Universal Agreement**: Assumes a disputed idea (going to doctors makes one lazy).
    - Score: 70/100

14. **Retrospective Reasoning**: Concerns a present action rather than a past event.
    - Score: 25/100

15. **Manifest Transgression**: Avoiding medical doctors isn't universally wrong, but presents potentially harmful advice.
    - Score: 30/100

16. **Ambiguous Statements**: Clear assertion, but "lazy" could be subjective.
    - Score: 50/100

17. **False Definitions**: Labels seeing medical doctors as leading to laziness without proper justification.
    - Score: 70/100

18. **Disputed Proof**: Dependent on a disputed premise (medical doctors make you lazy).
    - Score: 80/100

19. **Unsettled Controversy**: Centers on an unsettled and controversial claim.
    - Score: 75/100

20. **Self-Contradiction**: Doesn’t contradict itself within the statement.
    - Score: 10/100

21. **Inconsistency with the Audience**: Could be inconsistent especially with audiences valuing medical advice.
    - Score: 80/100

22. **Unfulfilled Promises**: No promises made within the statement.
    - Score: 10/100

23. **Changing the Subject**: Stays on the subject of illness and doctors.
    - Score: 20/100

24. **Faulty Disparagement**: Generalizes the role of medical doctors negatively.
    - Score: 85/100

25. **Crime Identification**: Not applicable here; not focused on identifying a specific crime.
    - Score: 10/100

26. **Unbalanced Comparison**: Doesn’t compare to another alternative explicitly, but implies it.
    - Score: 50/100

27. **Disparaging When Unnecessary**: Not inherently necessary to avoid doctors, particularly if not going causes more harm.
    - Score: 65/100

28. **Controversy on Names**: No name controversy; straightforward in terminology.
    - Score: 10/100

29. **Faulty Simile**: No direct comparison (simile) made.
    - Score: 20/100

30. **False Example**: Implies a false outcome example (doctors -> laziness).
    - Score: 75/100

31. **Invalid Previous Judgements**: Not based on citing prior judgments.
    - Score: 20/100

32. **Redundant Proof**: Contains no proof of its assertions.
    - Score: 70/100

33. **Unbacked Amplification**: Amply declares a result without proof (become lazy).
    - Score: 75/100
  
34. **Incomplete Résumé**: Not summarizing an argument, per se.
    - Score: 10/100

**Overall Evaluation**: The statement <SP> significantly exhibits several types of defective arguments, particularly faulty generalization, inappropriate & misapplied reasoning, and disputed proof. 

Average Score Across All Categories: (Summation of all Scores / 34):
   - Average Score ≈ 45/100

This result shows that the argument encompasses a blend of many defective argument types, leaning more towards inappropriate and contradictory logic.
