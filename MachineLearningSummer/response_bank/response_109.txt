For impossibility.txt
To break down the statement "<SP> No one can graduate from university before the age of 19," and determine the worst three types of defective arguments using the guidelines from <RB>, we can identify:

1. **Generalization**:
   - Example: The statement broadly and inaccurately generalizes that it's impossible for anyone to graduate from university before the age of 19. There are numerous instances of gifted students who complete their university education earlier due to accelerated learning programs, exceptional talent, or different educational systems.

2. **Impossibility**:
   - Example: The notion that "no one" can achieve this feat implies an impossible standard, ignoring exceptional cases and varying educational paths worldwide. Declaring something impossible without considering exceptions and variations is a key logical error.

3. **False Universals**:
   - Example: This assertion uses a false universal term "no one," which leaves no room for exceptions. Universals like "always," "never," and "everyone" often overstate claims, leading to exaggerated or false conclusions.

By ignoring evidence of exceptional individuals and assuming a one-size-fits-all approach, the statement exhibits these prominent logical fallacies that weaken its credibility and accuracy.
