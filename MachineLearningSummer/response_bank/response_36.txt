To evaluate the argument in <SP> ("You must avoid medical doctors when ill or you will become lazy") against the criteria provided in <RB>, we need to break down the types of defects present and assign ratings accordingly. We'll go through each potentially relevant defect type and justify the rating on a scale from 1 to 100 (with 100 being the most defective).

### 1. Faulty Propositions

- **Generalization**: The argument generalizes the outcome of becoming lazy merely by visiting doctors when ill. This lacks specificity and is obviously not universally true.
  - **Rating**: 95 (Highly defective, as it generalizes behavior without evidence)

- **Impossibility**: It implies that visiting a doctor inevitably leads to laziness, which is an extreme and unlikely result.
  - **Rating**: 85 (Very defective, nearing impossibility)

- **Incomplete Enumeration**: The assertion doesn't consider other potential outcomes of visiting doctors other than becoming lazy.
  - **Rating**: 80 (Highly defective due to lack of consideration of comprehensive outcomes)

- **False Enumeration**: It narrows down the consequence of visiting doctors to laziness without acknowledging other possible positive effects like recovery, improved health, or advice on maintaining activity.
  - **Rating**: 90 (Highly defective due to false limitation of consequences)

### 2. Weak or Groundless Reasons

- **Groundless Reason**: The premise that visiting doctors causes laziness is unfounded and lacks supporting evidence.
  - **Rating**: 100 (The argument is based on a completely unsupported reason)

### 3. Faulty Proofs of the Reason

- **Misleading Defenses**: If the argument uses pretexts or assumptions about the behavior of people visiting doctors, it would be misleading.
  - **Rating**: 90 (Highly defective as it relies on misleading justifications)

- **Questionable Statements**: The statement that medical visits lead to laziness is questionable and unsupported.
  - **Rating**: 95 (The argument makes a highly dubious assertion)

- **Inconsistent Reasoning**: If taken in a broader context, this statement might contradict other rational behavior or health advice, indicating inconsistency.
  - **Rating**: 88 (High defectiveness due to potential inconsistency with common sense and medical advice)

### 4. Faulty Embellishments

- The argument lacks proper embellishments; it doesn't utilize examples, judgments, or amplifications correctly, but this category seems less relevant compared to core reasoning errors.

### Overall Rating Justification

Given the breakdown, we see that the argument shows extreme defects in terms of generalization, unsupported or groundless reasons, and questionable statements. The key issues lie in how unsupported and overly generalizing the statement is, along with lacking evidence and logical consistency.

**Final Defectiveness Rating: 93**

This indicates that the argument is highly defective due to numerous logical fallacies and weak reasoning, according to the criteria provided in Cicero's "Rhetorica ad Herennium".
