For false_enum.txt
To rate the argument in "<SP> Only money can make people do heinous things" using the criteria from <RB>, we must break down each component and evaluate them based on the defective argument types outlined. Here's a step-by-step analysis:

### Step 1: Proposition
**Proposition**: "Only money can make people do heinous things."
#### Evaluation:
- **False Enumeration**: The proposition lists money as the sole motivator for heinous acts, ignoring other potential motives like ambition, fear, revenge, ideology, or mental illness.
- **Generalization**: It generalizes that all heinous acts are driven by money, disregarding specific instances where other reasons might be the cause.

**Rating Justification**: The proposition is highly defective because it limits the reasons for heinous acts to money alone without considering other well-documented motivators.

**Rating**: 85 (High severity due to false enumeration and generalization)

### Step 2: Reason
**Reason**: Implicit in the statement is the assumed reason that only money can incite such behavior due to its perceived power and influence.
#### Evaluation:
- **Groundless Reason**: There's no substantial evidence provided that money is the exclusive motivator for all heinous actions.
- **Inappropriate Reason**: The reasoning does not adequately support the proposition since it doesn't rule out other causes.

**Rating Justification**: The reason invoked is weak and insufficiently substantiated, implying a reliance on a widely contested and simplified view.

**Rating**: 80 (High severity due to groundless and inappropriate reasoning)

### Step 3: Proof of the Reason
**Proof of the Reason**: Often implied or anecdotal—people might cite high-profile crimes driven by financial gain.
#### Evaluation:
- **Misleading Defenses**: Using specific instances where money was the motivator as proof for a universal claim is incorrect.
- **Belated Arguments**: Arguing based on selective, high-profile cases without a comprehensive view of all motivations for heinous acts is unreliable.
- **Peripheral Disputes**: The proof is tangential without accounting for the full spectrum of possible motives.

**Rating Justification**: The proof provided is unconvincing and doesn't accurately establish the exclusivity of money as a motivator.

**Rating**: 75 (High severity due to misleading and limited proof)

### Step 4: Embellishment
**Embellishment**: Assertions that money’s influence over people is so powerful it can lead them to commit the most heinous acts.
#### Evaluation:
- **Inexact Similes**: Any embellishments might use inaccurate comparisons between money’s influence and other factors.
- **Unsupported Examples**: Citing extreme cases without a balanced view of less sensational examples.
  
**Rating Justification**: Embellishments further weaken the argument when overstretched comparisons or unfounded examples are used.

**Rating**: 70 (Relatively high severity due to potential for unsupported or inaccurate examples)

### Step 5: Résumé
**Résumé**: Reiteration of the claim that only money leads to heinous acts, aiming to drive home the flawed central argument.
#### Evaluation:
- **Incomplete Summary**: Does not account for all the possible motivators and overlooks the complexity of human behavior.

**Rating Justification**: The résumé inherently carries forward all flaws of the initial proposition and reason.

**Rating**: 75 (High severity, reflecting the cumulative defects in the argument)

### Overall Rating
Averaging the individual step ratings: (85+80+75+70+75)/5 = 77

**Overall Rating**: 77

**Summary Justification**: The argument "Only money can make people do heinous things" is highly defective due to false enumeration, groundless reason, misleading proofs, inaccurate embellishments, and an incomplete summary, warranting a high defectiveness rating of 77.
