For impossibility.txt
Analyzing the statement *"No one can graduate from university before the age of 19,"* we can evaluate it for logical fallacies and argumentative errors as outlined in <RB>. Here's a breakdown of three prominent defective argument types present in this statement:


1. **Impossibility**:
   - **Score:** 95/100
   - **Explanation:** The claim "*No one can graduate from university before the age of 19*" asserts an absolute impossibility, which is factually incorrect. There are numerous recorded instances of prodigies or highly intelligent individuals graduating from university at a younger age. The use of "No one" creates an almost totalistic statement that doesn't leave room for exceptions, which is a severe logical flaw.

2. **Generalization**:
   - **Score:** 90/100
   - **Explanation:** This claim generalizes about a common occurrence by stating that it is true in all cases. While it may be less common for individuals to graduate before 19, it is not a universal truth. This oversimplification ignores individual differences and exceptional cases, leading to an erroneous conclusion based on limited observation.

3. **False Universals**:
   - **Score:** 85/100
   - **Explanation:** The statement "No one can graduate from university before the age of 19" uses a universal quantifier ("No one"), which implies that there are no exceptions to this rule. This is a classic example of a false universal because it overlooks rare but real instances of young graduates.

Together, these fallacies severely undermine the validity of the statement "*No one can graduate from university before the age of 19*" by making unfounded, generalizing, and erroneously absolute claims. Recognizing these errors helps improve critical thinking and promotes more accurate and nuanced arguments.
