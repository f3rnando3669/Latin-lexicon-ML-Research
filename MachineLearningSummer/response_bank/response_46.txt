To evaluate the arguments in <SP> using <RB>, we'll break down each assertion and assess any presence of defective argument characteristics, rating them on a scale from 1 to 100 (with 1 being the least defective and 100 being the most defective).

### Argument 1: "The goddess Fortune is blind, for that she fails wholly to perceive whereto she attaches herself."

#### Step-by-Step Evaluation:
1. **Faulty Proposition**:
   - **Generalization**: The argument implies a universal truth based on an interpretation or mythological belief about Fortune. Relying on such a metaphor may be too broad without concrete evidence. **Rating: 50**
   - **Impossibility**: Declaring Fortune blind isn’t quantifiable or absolute since it's a metaphorical statement. **Rating: 30**
   - **Faulty Enumeration**: It fails to consider other attributes or perspectives of Fortune. **Rating: 40**
   
2. **Weak or Groundless Reasons**:
   - **Inappropriate Reason**: Ascribing blindness to Fortune based on an abstract action (not perceiving any attachments) is weak and inadequate as concrete reason. **Rating: 70**
   - **Groundless Reason**: The statement lacks any tangible support or evidence. **Rating: 80**
   
3. **Faulty Proofs of the Reason**:
   - **Peripheral Disputes**: This is a mythological metaphor used broadly, so claiming something “blind” when it lacks a physical form pushes the reason beyond subjective interpretation. **Rating: 60**
   - **False Universals**: The claim is a broad generalization without proof. **Rating: 60**
   
4. **Faulty Embellishments**:
   - **Inexact Similes**: The metaphor is used in a way that lacks precise and rigorous comparison to real-world entities. **Rating: 70**

**Total Assessment**: Averaging the above reasoning:
\[ \text{(50 + 30 + 40 + 70 + 80 + 60 + 60 + 70)} / 8 = 57.5 \]

**Rating: 58 (Average level of defectiveness)**

### Argument 2: "She is stupid because she knows not how to tell worthy from unworthy."

#### Step-by-Step Evaluation:
1. **Faulty Proposition**:
   - **Generalization**: Assuming Fortune’s choices reflect stupidity is broad without specific cases. **Rating: 60**
   - **Impossibility**: Declaring a mythological entity as incapable (stupid) is unverifiable. **Rating: 50**
   - **Incomplete Enumeration**: It excludes other potential explanations aside from stupidity. **Rating: 45**
   
2. **Weak or Groundless Reasons**:
   - **Inappropriate Reason**: Equating the inability to differentiate worth with stupidity oversimplifies the concept. **Rating: 75**
   - **Groundless Reason**: There is no verifiable basis or evidence provided. **Rating: 80**
   
3. **Faulty Proofs of the Reason**:
   - **Misapplication of Signs**: The inability to differentiate worth doesn’t necessarily indicate stupidity; the criteria may be different or complex. **Rating: 70**
   - **False Universals**: The statement uses broad assumptions. **Rating: 65**
   
4. **Faulty Embellishments**:
   - **Inexact Similes**: Comparing non-human divine qualities with human traits like stupidity can be inaccurate. **Rating: 70**

**Total Assessment**: Averaging the above reasoning:
\[ \text{(60 + 50 + 45 + 75 + 80 + 70 + 65 + 70)} / 8 = 64.38 \]

**Rating: 64 (Above average level of defectiveness)**

### Final Ratings:
- Argument 1: **58**
- Argument 2: **64**

### Justifications:
- Both arguments heavily rely on metaphors and generalizations without concrete evidence.
- They utilize dramatic assumptions without thorough reasoning or proof.
- There are substantial logical gaps and weaknesses in both justifications provided for the propositions.

These ratings indicate both arguments are fairly defective, with the second argument being slightly more so than the first.
