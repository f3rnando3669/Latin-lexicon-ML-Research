Sure, let's examine the statement "One must avoid the sun because it is far away from us." for each type of defective argument, scoring out of 100 based on its relevance to the provided fallacies and errors:

1. **Generalization**: 10/100
   - Not relevant, as it’s a specific statement.

2. **Impossibility**: 20/100
   - Slightly relevant because it sets an unreasonable condition.

3. **Incomplete Enumeration**: 0/100
   - Not relevant.

4. **False Enumeration**: 10/100
   - Slightly relevant as it might imply that distance is the only reason to avoid the sun.

5. **Remote Tracing**: 0/100
   - Not relevant.

6. **Inappropriate Reason**: 90/100
   - Highly relevant because the distance of the sun isn't a logical reason to avoid it.

7. **Groundless Reason**: 85/100
   - Highly relevant, as the reason provided has no basis.

8. **Redundant Reason**: 0/100
   - Not relevant.

9. **Weak Causal Basis**: 75/100
   - Highly relevant, as the causal link between the sun’s distance and the need to avoid it is weak.

10. **Misapplied Reason**: 20/100
    - Slightly relevant because the distance is an odd reason but not applicable here.

11. **Dilemma Misuse**: 0/100
    - Not relevant.

12. **Misapplication of Signs**: 0/100
    - Not relevant.

13. **Peripheral Disputes**: 0/100
    - Not relevant.

14. **Banality**: 0/100
    - Not relevant.

15. **False Universals**: 10/100
    - Slightly relevant as it implies a universal rule without basis.

16. **Belated Arguments**: 0/100
    - Not relevant.

17. **Misleading Defenses**: 0/100
    - Not relevant.

18. **Double-Edged Phrases**: 0/100
    - Not relevant.

19. **Misleading Definitions**: 0/100
    - Not relevant.

20. **Questionable Statements**: 60/100
    - Relevant as the statement is questionable.

21. **Inconsistent Reasoning**: 70/100
    - Highly relevant because avoiding the sun due to its distance is inconsistent.

22. **Hostile Addressing**: 0/100
    - Not relevant.

23. **Incomplete Proofs**: 0/100
    - Not relevant.

24. **Topic Shifting**: 0/100
    - Not relevant.

25. **Fault by Association**: 0/100
    - Not relevant.

26. **Evidence Mix-Up**: 0/100
    - Not relevant.

27. **Biased Comparisons**: 0/100
    - Not relevant.

28. **Name Disputes**: 0/100
    - Not relevant.

29. **Inexact Similes**: 0/100
    - Not relevant.

30. **Unsupported Examples**: 10/100
    - Slightly relevant as the reason lacks support.

31. **Misapplied Judgements**: 10/100
    - Slightly relevant because the judgment of avoiding the sun is misapplied.

32. **Unnecessary Establishments**: 50/100
    - Relevant as it establishes a point that does not need proving.

33. **Amplification Errors**: 0/100
    - Not relevant.

34. **Incomplete Summaries**: 0/100
    - Not relevant.

The most relevant defective arguments in the statement appear to be **Inappropriate Reason (90/100)**, **Groundless Reason (85/100)**, **Weak Causal Basis (75/100)**, **Questionable Statements (60/100)**, and **Inconsistent Reasoning (70/100)**. These cover the key issues with the provided statement, highlighting its logical inconsistencies.
