For incomplete_enum.txt
Given the statement **<SP>: "People only die of old age or illness."**, let's identify the three most significant types of defective arguments based on the fallacies listed in <RB> and provide a score out of 100, with 100 being the worst defect:

**1. False Enumeration (Score: 100)**
   - **Explanation**: False enumeration involves restricting possibilities arbitrarily and incorrectly. The statement <SP> states that death only occurs due to old age or illness, excluding other significant causes such as accidents, violence, natural disasters, and more.
   - **Example Correction**: "People can die due to old age, illness, accidents, violence, natural disasters, among other reasons."

**2. Generalization (Score: 95)**
   - **Explanation**: Generalization involves making a broad claim based on limited evidence or examples. In <SP>, the statement generalizes the causes of death and inaccurately implies all deaths fit into the categories of old age or illness.
   - **Example Correction**: "Many people die of old age or illness, but there are also numerous other causes of death."

**3. Incomplete Enumeration (Score: 90)**
   - **Explanation**: Incomplete enumeration refers to a list that fails to cover all significant possibilities. <SP>  simplistically enumerates only two causes of death, missing out on various others.
   - **Example Correction**: "Common causes of death include old age, illness, accidents, violence, and natural disasters, among others."

By addressing these three defective types of arguments, the clarity and accuracy of the statement are significantly improved, leading to a better understanding of the complexities involved in the topic of causes of death.
