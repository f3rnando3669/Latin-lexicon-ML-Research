Starting with the types of defective arguments delineated in <RB>, let's evaluate the statement <SP> step by step and rate how defective the arguments presented are. We'll break down <SP> into its key claims and analyze each for any logical flaws.

### Step 1: Analyzing the First Key Claim
**Claim:** "The goddess Fortune is blind and stupid."
- **Possible Defective Argument:** Inappropriate Reason, Groundless Reason, Misleading Definitions

**Justification:**
- **Inappropriate Reason:** The terms "blind" and "stupid" are being used metaphorically to describe an abstract concept (Fortune). The connection between these characteristics and the concept of Fortune isn't directly logical but relies on emotional appeal or common metaphorical usage.

### Rating for the First Claim: 60 out of 100
- The argument uses metaphorical language without strong logical grounding, leaning towards an unsupported assertion that might be seen as weak for rigorous logical debate.

### Step 2: Analyzing the Second Key Claim
**Claim:** "She is blind, for that she fails wholly to perceive whereto she attaches herself."
- **Possible Defective Argument:** Misleading Defenses, False Universals, Questionable Statements

**Justification:**
- **Misleading Defenses:** The statement generalizes the irrational behavior of Fortune without any concrete proof.
- **False Universals:** It assumes a universally accepted definition of "blind" as failing to perceive, which isn't substantiated.
- **Questionable Statements:** The argument lacks empirical or logical evidence to support the assertion that Fortune "fails wholly to perceive."

### Rating for the Second Claim: 75 out of 100
- This argument heavily relies on metaphorical language and generalization, exhibiting weak logical structure and unsupported assumptions.

### Step 3: Analyzing the Third Key Claim
**Claim:** "She is stupid because she knows not how to tell worthy from unworthy."
- **Possible Defective Argument:** False Universals, Inappropriate Reason, Inexact Similes

**Justification:**
- **False Universals:** Assumes a universal acceptance that Fortune distributes rewards without discernment (without evidence).
- **Inappropriate Reason:** The quality of differentiation between worthy and unworthy is subjective and not adequately defined or linked to the abstract concept of Fortune.
- **Inexact Similes:** Comparing Fortune's actions to a lack of intelligence implies a direct comparison that may not hold under scrutiny.

### Rating for the Third Claim: 80 out of 100
- This argument is weaker due to its reliance on subjective interpretation and lack of concrete evidence. It heavily leans on metaphor.

### Final Rating and Summary:
- **Overall Rating for <SP>: 72 out of 100**
  - The overall argument presented in <SP> is highly metaphorical and weak in logical grounding. Definitions and assertions are too generalized without substantial proof, and metaphorical language weakens logical integrity.
  - The justifications draw attention to common flaws like False Universals, Inappropriate Reason, and Questionable Statements, making the argument relatively easy to refute in a rigorous discourse setting.
