Analyzing the statement "You must avoid medical doctors when ill because otherwise you will become lazy" using the response from <RB>, the worst three types of defective arguments in this statement would probably be:

1. **Inappropriate Reason**:
   - The reason provided for avoiding medical doctors (to avoid becoming lazy) is inappropriate, as it does not logically follow that seeking medical help when ill leads to laziness. The primary purpose of visiting a doctor when ill is to diagnose and treat the illness, which is crucial for health and well-being.

2. **Groundless Reason**:
   - The claim that avoiding doctors will prevent laziness lacks any evidence or basis. Laziness is not causally connected to medical consultation; people visit doctors to recover from illnesses. There is no support provided that links consulting doctors to becoming lazy.

3. **False Universals**:
   - The statement implies a universal truth that consulting doctors when ill makes everyone lazy. This is a broad and unsupported generalization. In reality, people visit doctors to regain health and function, which is often the opposite of being lazy.

These defects make the statement illogical and not credible as guidance for health-related decision-making.
