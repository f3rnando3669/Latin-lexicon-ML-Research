Let's analyze <SP> step-by-step in light of <RB> to identify any defects in the arguments and provide a rating on a scale of 1 to 100 (where 1 is highly defective and 100 is logically sound).

### Analysis of <SP>:

**Argument:**
"In our wretched life, there is any such thing as Fortune; there is, they say, Blind Accident. That this is more like the truth, is proved by the actual experience of life; even as Orestes now was king, and now became a beggar."

1. **Faulty Propositions:**
   - **Generalization**: The argument generalizes from the experience of Orestes to all of life. This is a classic **Generalization** defect (Rating Reduced).
   - **Impossibility**: The argument does not declare anything as impossible but does make a sweeping assertion about fortune and blind accident (not directly at fault here).
   
2. **Weak or Groundless Reasons:**
   - **Inappropriate Reason**: The reason provided—experiences of Orestes as proof—is inappropriate as it’s a singular example rather than a comprehensive reason. This is classified under **Inappropriate Reason** (Rating Reduced).
   - **Groundless Reason**: No clear evidence is provided, only an anecdotal instance, thereby it can be a **Groundless Reason**.
   - **Redundant Reason**: This is not redundant; it is not merely rephrasing the proposition.
   - **Weak Causal Basis**: The causal basis, linking "actual experience of life" to the argument, is weak as it relies on one historical example (Rating Reduced).

3. **Faulty Proofs of the Reason:**
   - **Dilemma Misuse**: Not applicable, no dilemma provided.
   - **Misapplication of Signs**: The specific case of Orestes is used improperly to signify a general truth about life, a **Misapplication of Signs** (Rating Reduced).
   - **Peripheral Disputes**: No such disputes are evident here.
   - **Banality**: The argument is somewhat banal—it is an overused idea to say "life is a blind accident" without nuanced examples.
   - **False Universals**: The argument presents a universal without any statistically or logically sound support, this is a **False Universals** defect (Rating Reduced).
   - **Belated Arguments**: The timing of the argument is not an issue here.
   - **Misleading Defenses**: No clear misleading defenses, but unsupported generalizations are evident.
   - **Double-Edged Phrases**: The statements are not ambiguous or dual-interpretive.
   - **Misleading Definitions**: Definitions of "Fortune" and "Blind Accident" are not distinctly provided; however, the argument is contextually clear.
   - **Questionable Statements**: The assertion about "actual experience of life" is a **Questionable Statement** due to lack of evidence (Rating Reduced).
   - **Inconsistent Reasoning**: There is no direct inconsistency, but the conclusion is not strongly reasoned.
   - **Hostile Addressing**: The argument is not targeting the audience directly.
   - **Incomplete Proofs**: The proof is incomplete, offering only one anecdotal example as elaboration.
   - **Topic Shifting**: The argument stays on the primary topic.
   - **Fault by Association**: Not applicable here.
   - **Evidence Mix-Up**: There is no evidence of misconduct.
   - **Biased Comparisons**: No comparative argument made.
   - **Name Disputes**: Naming conventions are not relevant to this argument.
   
4. **Faulty Embellishments:**
   - **Inexact Similes**: No similes are used.
   - **Unsupported Examples**: Using Orestes as a singular example to support a broad assertion falls under **Unsupported Examples** (Rating Reduced).
   - **Misapplied Judgements**: Referencing a mythological figure as judgment for human experiences is a misapplication.
   - **Unnecessary Establishments**: The argument does not waste time proving already conceded points.
   - **Amplification Errors**: As the main point is a generalization from a singular example, this counts as amplification error.
   - **Incomplete Summaries**: Conclusion is given but the parts of the proof are not adequately covered.

### Rating: 
Given the numerous defects identified according to <RB>, such as inappropriate reasons, misapplied signs, false universals, unsupported examples, amplification errors, and weak causal bases, the argument can be rated with substantial defects.

**Final Rating: 30/100**

This rating reflects **substantial logical defects and weakness in evidentiary support** based on the criteria provided in <RB>. The argument fails to provide a robust, logically airtight case and leans heavily on generalizations, anecdotal evidence, and unsupported claims.
