For false_enum.txt
Analyzing **<SP>** ("Only money can make people do heinous things") using the response <RB>, we can identify various fallacies and errors. Here are the worst three types of defective arguments present in the statement, along with a score based on their severity (out of 100):

1. **Generalization (Score: 95)**:
   - **Fallacy**: This statement generalizes a single factor, money, as the only reason people commit heinous acts.
   - **Impact**: It ignores other motivators such as vengeance, ideology, psychological disorders, and more. This oversimplification of human behavior is a major flaw and significantly undermines the argument's credibility.

2. **False Universals (Score: 90)**:
   - **Fallacy**: The claim uses "only" and "can," suggesting an absolute, universal truth about human behavior.
   - **Impact**: This type of reasoning is highly inaccurate, as it does not account for the complexity and multiple facets of human actions and motivations. It dismisses the range of factors that can influence heinous behavior, thus severely weakening the statement's validity.

3. **Incomplete Enumeration (Score: 85)**:
   - **Fallacy**: By stating that only money is the cause, it dismisses a myriad of other potential causes.
   - **Impact**: This makes the argument incomplete as it fails to consider other significant factors. It does not provide a comprehensive enumeration of all possible motivators for heinous acts, leading to an incomplete and biased understanding.

Thus, <SP> falls short primarily due to:
1. **Generalization**: Score 95
2. **False Universals**: Score 90
3. **Incomplete Enumeration**: Score 85

These types of defective arguments considerably reduce the reliability and persuasiveness of the statement.
