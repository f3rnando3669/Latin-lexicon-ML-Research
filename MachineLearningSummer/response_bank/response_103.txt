In the statement "Only money can make people do heinous things," there are several types of defective arguments at play. However, the three worst types according to the previously explained fallacies and defects are:

1. **False Enumeration**:
    - The statement restricts the possible motives for committing heinous acts to a single factorâ€”money. This overlooks countless other potential motives such as power, ideology, personal revenge, mental illness, etc. The vast range of human behavior cannot be accurately captured by attributing such actions solely to monetary motives.

2. **Generalization**:
    - The claim generalizes that all instances of heinous behavior are motivated by money, without acknowledging the unique circumstances or additional factors that might drive individuals to commit such acts. This broad assertion is flawed because it ignores the complexity of human motivations and reduces them to a single cause.

3. **Inappropriate Reason**:
    - It is inappropriate to attribute every heinous act to money, as many such acts are committed for other reasons that have little to do with financial gain. For example, acts of violence may be perpetrated out of hatred, a desire for revenge, or mental health issues. The reasoning is overly simplistic and fails to consider the multifaceted nature of human actions.

By recognizing these defective arguments, we can better understand the shortcomings of the statement and why it does not hold up under critical scrutiny.
