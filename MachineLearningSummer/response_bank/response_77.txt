For false_enum.txt
Based on the summary provided in the rule book, let's evaluate the statement "Only money can make people do heinous things." for each type of defective argument listed:

- **Generalization**: 90/100  
  The statement is overly general, assuming that only money can drive people to commit heinous acts, ignoring other possible motivations like power, revenge, ideology, etc.

- **Impossibility**: 80/100  
  It declares an absolute (only money) which rules out other rare but possible motivations like emotional distress or fanaticism.

- **Incomplete Enumeration**: 85/100  
  By stating "only money," it fails to list other potential motives, demonstrating an incomplete enumeration.

- **False Enumeration**: 70/100  
  The argument lists fewer motivations than exist, implying exclusivity that is not realistic.

- **Remote Tracing**: 40/100  
  The statement is assertive and doesn’t trace the origin of the argument too far back.

- **Inappropriate Reason**: 85/100  
  The claim that "only money" is the reason behind heinous acts seems inappropriate without logical support.

- **Groundless Reason**: 90/100  
  This is a groundless assertion since it lacks evidence to prove that only money drives heinous acts.

- **Redundant Reason**: 30/100  
  While redundant reasoning is not strongly indicated here, the statement doesn’t simply repeat itself.

- **Weak Causal Basis**: 95/100  
  Offering a weak causal relationship by implying money is the sole reason without providing compelling backing.

- **Misapplied Reason**: 70/100  
  Misapplication isn't strongly evident, but the reason given (only money) is overly restrictive.

- **Dilemma Misuse**: 60/100  
  It doesn’t present a dilemma, but asserting it in a debated context can be rebutted easily.

- **Misapplication of Signs**: 75/100  
  Using money as a sign for all heinous acts is a misuse of signs since motives can vary widely.

- **Peripheral Disputes**: 60/100  
  The statement might fit other disputes but not overtly.

- **Banality**: 50/100  
  The concept isn’t necessarily an overused excuse, but it is a common simplification.

- **False Universals**: 85/100  
  Asserting a universal point ("only money") without proof makes it a false universal.

- **Belated Arguments**: 40/100  
  Argument timing isn’t indicated as belated here.

- **Misleading Defenses**: 80/100  
  Could be seen as a pretext to oversimplify the reasons behind heinous acts.

- **Double-Edged Phrases**: 65/100  
  Statements open to multiple interpretations if analyzed deeply but not immediately apparent.

- **Misleading Definitions**: 85/100  
  Defining motivations behind heinous acts too narrowly is misleading.

- **Questionable Statements**: 90/100  
  Unproven assertion without substantial backing.

- **Inconsistent Reasoning**: 50/100  
  Not directly contradictory within itself, but overly simplified.

- **Hostile Addressing**: 40/100  
  Might not directly oppose audience beliefs depending on context.

- **Incomplete Proofs**: 95/100  
  Fails to substantiate how only money is the driving force.

- **Topic Shifting**: 50/100  
  Doesn’t deviate from the main issue but oversimplifies it.

- **Fault by Association**: 70/100  
  Implies a bias against monetary motivations inaccurately.

- **Evidence Mix-Up**: 80/100  
  Lacks evidence identifying all perpetrators and their motives.

- **Biased Comparisons**: 85/100  
  Implies unfair comparisons by excluding other motivators.

- **Name Disputes**: 50/100  
  Not strongly indicated, but the semantics of "only" can cause disagreement.

- **Inexact Similes**: 75/100  
  Not using similes directly but the simplistic comparison is evident.

- **Unsupported Examples**: 90/100  
  Without specific examples to support the claim, it’s unfounded.

- **Misapplied Judgements**: 80/100  
  Using a narrow judgment without proper reasoning.

  Asserts a point challenged by obvious complex realities.
