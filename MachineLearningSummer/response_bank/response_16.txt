Let's evaluate the argument in <SP> step by step according to the guidelines from <RB> on defective arguments:

### Premise 1: All humans are primates.
- **Evaluation**: This statement is a factual proposition and is scientifically accurate.
- **Defective Argument Rating**: 0/100 (This is a sound argument and has no defects.)

### Premise 2: All gorillas are primates.
- **Evaluation**: This is also a factual proposition and remains scientifically accurate.
- **Defective Argument Rating**: 0/100 (This is a sound argument and has no defects.)

### Conclusion: All humans are gorillas.
- **Evaluation**: This conclusion is logically unsound because it incorrectly infers that membership in the category of primates implies identity across all subcategories of primates. This is an **inappropriate reason** leading to a **false conclusion** by misunderstanding categorical logic.
- **Defective Argument Rating Justifications**:
  - **Inappropriate Reason**: The reasoning does not logically support the proposition. The fact that humans and gorillas are both primates does not mean humans are gorillas.
  - **False Conclusion**: The conclusion results from a logical fallacy where it confuses general membership with specific identity.

Given this, we consider elements  **inappropriate reason** and **false conclusion** to evaluate:
  - Missing logical supporting evidence 
  - Inappropriate reasoning leading to unsound conclusions.

Considering these two major defects:
- **Rating**: 100/100 (The conclusion is fundamentally flawed and logically unsound according to <RB>). 

#### Summary Ratings:
- **Premise 1**: 0/100 (sound)
- **Premise 2**: 0/100 (sound)
- **Conclusion**: 100/100 (defective)

Therefore, the final composite rating for the argument's defectiveness in <SP> is **100/100**, due to invalid logical inference leading to a false conclusion, as governed by the principles outlined in <RB>.
