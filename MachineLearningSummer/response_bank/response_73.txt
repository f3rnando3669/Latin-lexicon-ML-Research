For generalization.txt
Let's analyze the statement "Anything you can put in your mouth is good for you" using the defective arguments described in the "Rhetorica ad Herennium" by Cicero. I will score each type of defective argument out of 100 based on how much it applies to the given statement.

1. **Generalization**: 95/100  
   This argument generalizes that anything consumable is beneficial, which ignores the countless exceptions (e.g., poisonous substances, allergens).

2. **Impossibility**: 10/100  
   The statement doesn’t declare something rare as impossible.

3. **Incomplete Enumeration**: 85/100  
   It fails to specify or enumerate different types of consumable items that might not be beneficial.

4. **False Enumeration**: 90/100  
   It falsely claims all things put in the mouth are good, ignoring harmful items.

5. **Remote Tracing**: 5/100  
   The argument doesn’t trace its origin unnecessarily far back.

6. **Inappropriate Reason**: 85/100  
   The statement implies a reason without logical support.

7. **Groundless Reason**: 95/100  
   The reason given is completely false and doesn’t withstand scrutiny.

8. **Redundant Reason**: 70/100  
   It doesn’t restate the proposition but lacks any true supporting reason.

9. **Weak Causal Basis**: 90/100  
   The causal basis (implied that being edible makes it good) is weak.

10. **Misapplied Reason**: 80/100  
    The reason is misapplied since "putting in the mouth" doesn’t universally mean "good for you".

11. **Dilemma Misuse**: 40/100  
    Doesn’t set up a dilemma; it's a categorical statement.

12. **Misapplication of Signs**: 90/100  
    It misuses the sign "putting in the mouth" as indicative of being "good".

13. **Peripheral Disputes**: 50/100  
    It doesn’t fit oneself specifically.

14. **Banality**: 70/100  
    The notion that consumable equals good can be seen as an overused assumption.

15. **False Universals**: 95/100  
    It asserts a universal truth without proof.

16. **Belated Arguments**: 10/100  
    Not applicable as the timing of the argument isn’t belated.

17. **Misleading Defenses**: 75/100  
    If defended by trivializing harmful substances, it would be misleading.

18. **Double-Edged Phrases**: 60/100  
    Potentially dual interpretation but mainly still falls into other categories.

19. **Misleading Definitions**: 90/100  
    Defining "good" and "putting in the mouth" misleadingly.

20. **Questionable Statements**: 95/100  
    It’s an unproven assertion.

21. **Inconsistent Reasoning**: 80/100  
    Inconsistent comparing what's healthy and not, both are put in the mouth.

22. **Hostile Addressing**: 20/100  
    Not necessarily hostile, unless audience aspects counter dietary facts.

23. **Incomplete Proofs**: 90/100  
    Fails to substantiate the claim with all necessary proofs.

24. **Topic Shifting**: 70/100  
    May shift from nutritional debates to poison control.

25. **Fault by Association**: 50/100  
    Doesn’t disparage a field but could if used with medical discussions.

26. **Evidence Mix-Up**: 80/100  
    Proof of misconduct (if harmful) without identifying clear cases can be applied.

27. **Biased Comparisons**: 85/100  
    Implies all ingestibles are universally comparable as good.

28. **Name Disputes**: 60/100  
    Less relevant but could invoke lexical debate over "good".

29. **Inexact Similes**: 85/100  
    Overextends the logic from one to all.

30. **Unsupported Examples**: 90/100  
    Fails logical scrutiny with real-world harmful examples.

31. **Misapplied Judgments**: 75/100  
    Judged health benefits without specifics can be inappropriate.

32. **Unnecessary Establishments**: 40/100  
    Anything "putting in mouth" being "good" isn’t typically agreed to establish use.

33. **Amplification Errors**: 60/100  
    Amplifies "good for you" unjustifiably extended to all consumables.

34. **Incomplete Summaries**: 85/100  
    Concludes incorrectly without substantiating what's put in the mouth.

Based on the scores, the most fitting defective arguments types for "Anything you can put in your mouth is good for you" are:
- **Generalization (95)**
- **Groundless Reason (95)**
- **False Universals (95)**
- **Questionable Statements (95)**
