For incomplete_enum.txt
Let's analyze <SP> ("People only die of old age or illness") against the different types of defective arguments from <RB> and give a score out of 100 for each, where 100 indicates that the statement strongly fits the description of the defective argument, and 0 means it does not fit at all.

1. **Generalization**:
   - Score: 90
   - Reason: This statement attempts to encompass the entire range of possible causes of death, ignoring other factors such as accidents, violence, and malnutrition.

2. **Impossibility**:
   - Score: 20
   - Reason: It does not directly address an impossible scenario but overlooks other possibilities.

3. **Incomplete Enumeration**:
   - Score: 100
   - Reason: It simplifies the causes of death to just two, excluding many other causes.

4. **False Enumeration**:
   - Score: 100
   - Reason: Similar to Incomplete Enumeration, it presents a false dichotomy by suggesting there are only two causes of death.

5. **Remote Tracing**:
   - Score: 10
   - Reason: This argument doesn’t trace causes of death to a remote source but oversimplifies the immediate causes.

6. **Inappropriate Reason**:
   - Score: 20
   - Reason: The reason is not relevant or logical based on real-world statistics, but it isn't entirely misplaced either.

7. **Groundless Reason**:
   - Score: 70
   - Reason: The statement is grounded in a common but unsupported belief about causes of death.

8. **Redundant Reason**:
   - Score: 10
   - Reason: No redundancy is indicated in this statement.

9. **Weak Causal Basis**:
   - Score: 80
   - Reason: It weakly bases the causation of death on a highly limited scope of factors.

10. **Misapplied Reason**:
    - Score: 40
    - Reason: Moderately misapplies reasons by failing to acknowledge other causes.

11. **Dilemma Misuse**:
    - Score: 95
    - Reason: This statement sets up a false dilemma by presenting only two options for the cause of death.

12. **Misapplication of Signs**:
    - Score: 50
    - Reason: Moderately describes causes based on not clearly defined or correct signs.

13. **Peripheral Disputes**:
    - Score: 30
    - Reason: The argument is somewhat peripheral to the complete understanding of the topic.

14. **Banality**:
    - Score: 20
    - Reason: Generally obvious but not necessarily trivial within context.

15. **False Universals**:
    - Score: 100
    - Reason: This is a clear example of a false universal because it makes an absolute statement.

16. **Belated Arguments**:
    - Score: 10
    - Reason: It doesn’t reflect hindsight or corrective nature.

17. **Misleading Defenses**:
    - Score: 30
    - Reason: The statement might be intended to oversimplify for ease of understanding but is not defensively misleading.

18. **Double-Edged Phrases**:
    - Score: 20
    - Reason: This is not presented in a double-edged manner.

19. **Misleading Definitions**:
    - Score: 70
    - Reason: Misleadingly defines the scope of causes that fall under the term "death."

20. **Questionable Statements**:
    - Score: 100
    - Reason: Highly questionable given the ample evidence of other causes of death.

21. **Inconsistent Reasoning**:
    - Score: 60
    - Reason: Somewhat inconsistent with broader understanding but does not jump between opposing stances.

22. **Hostile Addressing**:
    - Score: 20
    - Reason: It’s not inherently hostile in its addressing.

23. **Incomplete Proofs**:
    - Score: 90
    - Reason: Provides a grossly simplistic view without proof or context around diversified causes of death.

24. **Topic Shifting**:
    - Score: 20
    - Reason: Remains within the topic of causes of death without irrelevant shifts.

25. **Fault by Association**:
    - Score: 10
    - Reason: Limited association falls here; not focusing on specific groups or individuals.

26. **Evidence Mix-Up**:
    - Score: 60
    - Reason: Misplaces the common causes onto an absolute, misrepresenting the collective dataset of death causes.

27. **Biased Comparisons**:
    - Score: 30
    - Reason: Formulation biases exist but without direct comparison.

28. **Name Disputes**:
    - Score: 10
    - Reason: No real disputes over specific terminology are present here.

29. **Inexact Similes**:
    - Score: 15
    - Reason: Contains inexact statements rather than similes.

30. **Unsupported Examples**:
    - Score: 85
    - Reason: No examples are provided to support the claims logically here.

31. **Misapplied Judgements**:
    - Score: 50
    - Reason: Partially misapplied due to contextually narrow judgment of scenarios.

32. **Unnecessary Establishments**:
    - Score: 60
    - Reason: Attempts to establish criteria unnecessarily narrow for a broad factual understanding.

33. **Amplification Errors**:
    - Score: 50
    - Reason: Amplifies normal understanding by oversimplifying death causes but not egregiously.

34. **Incomplete Summaries**:
    - Score: 70
    - Reason: Summarizes without a full review of existing knowledge of causes of death.

The scoring highlights how the statement "People only die of old age or illness" exhibits multiple logical fallacies and weaknesses. The highest scores indicate false enumeration, false universals, and incomplete enumeration as the most pronounced defective arguments in this case.
