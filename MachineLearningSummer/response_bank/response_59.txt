For false_enum.txt
Let's evaluate the argument in statement <SP> "Only money can make people do heinous things" step by step using the defective argument categories from Cicero's "Rhetorica ad Herennium." Each identified defect will contribute to the overall rating for how defective the argument is, on a scale from 1 to 100, where 100 is most defective.

1. **Generalization** (High Defect): The statement generalizes by attributing the cause for all heinous acts solely to money, ignoring other potential factors such as power, revenge, ideology, etc.
   - **Rating Impact**: 25

2. **False Enumeration** (High Defect): It falsely limits the causes of heinous actions to only one reason—money—while there are numerous other motivations.
   - **Rating Impact**: 20

3. **Incomplete Enumeration**: Similar to false enumeration, it neglects other causes entirely, failing to list other plausible reasons.
   - **Rating Impact**: 15

4. **Inappropriate Reason** (Moderate to High Defect): The reason provided (only money) does not logically support the proposition when considering the broad range of human motivations.
   - **Rating Impact**: 15

5. **Banality**: The argument could be seen as offering an overused excuse by attributing complex actions to a single, simplified cause.
   - **Rating Impact**: 10

6. **False Universals** (High Defect): It asserts a universally agreed point without proof or support, generalizing human behavior without empirical evidence.
   - **Rating Impact**: 20

7. **Unsupported Examples**: Likely uses examples that are false or at least incomplete to support the claim, given the sweeping scope of the assertion.
   - **Rating Impact**: 15

8. **Double-Edged Phrases**: While not explicitly present, the absolute nature of this argument can be easily turned against itself, showing that money is not the only motivator.
   - **Rating Impact**: 5

9. **Inexact Similes**: If additional comparisons are used to support the argument, they are possibly inexact or over-simplified.
   - **Rating Impact**: 10

10. **Evidence Mix-Up**: It does not identify specific evidence or perpetrators but makes a broad generalized claim.
    - **Rating Impact**: 10

**Summary and Final Rating**:
The argument in statement <SP> has significant defects due to its reliance on several logically unsound forms such as generalization, false enumeration, incomplete enumeration, inappropriate reason, banality, false universals, and unsupported examples. Each of these defects contributes to the overall rating for how defective the argument is.

Summing up the rated impacts:
25 (Generalization) + 20 (False Enumeration) + 15 (Incomplete Enumeration) + 15 (Inappropriate Reason) + 10 (Banality) + 20 (False Universals) + 15 (Unsupported Examples) + 5 (Double-Edged Phrases) + 10 (Inexact Similes) + 10 (Evidence Mix-Up) = 145

Since we are rating on a scale from 1 to 100 for defectiveness, the maximum allowable sum (100) compared to the sum we derived (145) means we normalize it by taking a proportional approach: 

\( \text{Normalized Rating} = \frac{145}{1.45} = 100 \)

However, recognizing that 100 indicates an extreme in defectiveness, we closely examine the defect list for any overlaps or minor impacts that could slightly adjust the final score downwards. Given the analysis, the absolute defects include primary issues with strong impacts:

A modestly adjusted final rating remains around **95** due to overlapping factors contributing strongly but aligned in core logical faults.

Thus, the overall rating for the argument's defectiveness in <SP> is:
**95 out of 100**.

This rating reflects the significant unreliable and unsound nature of the argument presented.
