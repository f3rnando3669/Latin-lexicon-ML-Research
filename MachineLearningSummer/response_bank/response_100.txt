For weak_causal_basis.txt
Let's evaluate the argument in <SP> against each type of defective argument mentioned in <RB> and score it out of 100. A higher score implies a stronger presence of the fallacy:

1. **Generalization**:
   - Score: 60. The statement "there is, they say, Blind Accident" suggests a generalized belief without adequate specific evidence.
   
2. **Impossibility**:
   - Score: 80. Saying "there is, they say, Blind Accident" can imply an impossibility or inevitability that cannot be disproven through rational argument.

3. **Incomplete Enumeration**:
   - Score: 70. By presenting fortune merely as "Blind Accident" without considering other explanations, the statement fails to enumerate all possibilities.

4. **False Enumeration**:
   - Score: 50. The statement narrowly isolates Blind Accident as the only cause of changes in fortune, excluding other plausible causes.

5. **Remote Tracing**:
   - Score: 30. The argument does not refer to tracing events or conditions over time; it only presents a broad perspective.

6. **Inappropriate Reason**:
   - Score: 20. The reasons provided are not directly inappropriate but are overly simplistic.

7. **Groundless Reason**:
   - Score: 75. The reasons given ("Blind Accident" and "actual experience of life") lack substantial grounding and are not thoroughly explained.

8. **Redundant Reason**:
   - Score: 30. The argument does not seem to be redundant in its reasoning but could be considered oversimplified.

9. **Weak Causal Basis**:
   - Score: 50. The basis for the causal relationship (Blind Accident = life changes) is relatively weak and superficial.

10. **Misapplied Reason**:
    - Score: 10. The reason does not seem misapplied but rather simplistic.

11. **Dilemma Misuse**:
    - Score: 60. Suggesting that life is entirely governed by Blind Accident could create a false dilemma where only accident or nothing influences events.

12. **Misapplication of Signs**:
    - Score: 40. The statement does not directly apply signs but suggests an abstract, unobservable presence of Blind Accident.

13. **Peripheral Disputes**:
    - Score: 10. No peripheral disputes are evident in the argument.

14. **Banality**:
    - Score: 50. The argument can be seen as banal since it appeals to a common belief without deep justification.

15. **False Universals**:
    - Score: 70. It employs a universal claim ("there is, they say, Blind Accident") without accounting for exceptions.

16. **Belated Arguments**:
    - Score: 20. The argument doesn't hinge on prior events being a better choice if approached differently but on philosophical determinism.

17. **Misleading Defenses**:
    - Score: 45. The defense that life changes due to Blind Accident doesn’t address other factors adequately.

18. **Double-Edged Phrases**:
    - Score: 40. Phrases aren’t necessarily double-edged but are vague.

19. **Misleading Definitions**:
    - Score: 60. It can mislead by defining life’s changes as solely due to Blind Accident.

20. **Questionable Statements**:
    - Score: 70. The factual basis of the statements is highly questionable and lacks evidence.

21. **Inconsistent Reasoning**:
    - Score: 20. There isn't much inconsistency, but it generalizes.

22. **Hostile Addressing**:
    - Score: 10. The argument does not address or attack anyone specifically.

23. **Incomplete Proofs**:
    - Score: 80. It provides incomplete proof by using anecdotal evidence ("Orestes now was king, and now became a beggar").

24. **Topic Shifting**:
    - Score: 20. The focus remains on the concept of Blind Accident throughout.

25. **Fault by Association**:
    - Score: 10. There’s no fault by association.

26. **Evidence Mix-Up**:
    - Score: 75. Using the experience of a singular historical or mythical figure isn’t representative evidence.

27. **Biased Comparisons**:
    - Score: 60. The comparison between a king becoming a beggar exemplifies extreme and potentially biased comparisons.

28. **Name Disputes**:
    - Score: 10. There are no name disputes evident.

29. **Inexact Similes**:
    - Score: 50. It assumes philosophical concepts (fortune, Blind Accident) relate directly to real life without precise definition or application.

30. **Unsupported Examples**:
    - Score: 85. Relies heavily on a single historical/mythical example (Orestes) to claim a universal truth.

31. **Misapplied Judgements**:
    - Score: 40. The judgment about life’s uncertainty might not fully correspond with real-world complexity.

32. **Unnecessary Establishments**:
    - Score: 30. The argument doesn’t establish unnecessary points but lacks all necessary reasoning.

33. **Amplification Errors**:
    - Score: 65. The emphasis on Blind Accident amplifies a philosophical idea into an overly determinative life law.

34. **Incomplete Summaries**:
    - Score: 75. The conclusion isn't thoroughly summarized; it presents a broad statement without full elaboration.

**Summary**:
<SP> has numerous significant fallacies, especially in making unsupported generalized claims, using incomplete proofs, and employing biased and weak causal bases. The higher scores in these areas underscore the argument's broad, unspecific nature and its significant reliance on a single anecdotal example. The total is an average of about 48, suggesting the argument contains substantial deficient reasoning, beneficial for illustrative examination of these fallacies.
