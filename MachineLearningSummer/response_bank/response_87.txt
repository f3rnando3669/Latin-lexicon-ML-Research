For impossibility.txt
Certainly! I will evaluate the statement "No one can graduate from university before the age of 19" according to each type of defective argument listed in the *Rhetorica ad Herennium*. The score out of 100 will reflect how strongly each type of defective argument applies, with 0 meaning it does not apply at all and 100 meaning it applies perfectly.

1. **Faulty Proposition (Generalizing Improperly)**: 80
   - This statement generalizes based on age, potentially ignoring exceptional cases.

2. **Impossible Generalizations**: 100
   - Declares it impossible to graduate before 19, though rare, it is possible.

3. **Incomplete Enumeration**: 0
   - Does not list options, so incompleteness is not a factor here.

4. **False Enumeration**: 0
   - No enumeration is done in the statement.

5. **Tracing Too Far Back**: 0
   - No tracing of causes or reasons here.

6. **Inappropriate Reason**: 0
   - No reason is given, so this does not apply.

7. **Circular Reasoning**: 0
   - The statement does not involve repetition of the same idea in different words.

8. **Adequacy in Reason**: 0
   - No reason given in the statement.

9. **Misapplied Reason**: 0
   - No reason provided, so this doesn't apply.

10. **Rebuttable Dilemma**: 0
    - No dilemma presented.

11. **Misapplied Sign**: 0
    - Not applicable since no signs are used.

12. **Banal Defense**: 0
    - No defense or excuse offered.

13. **Universal Agreement**: 50
    - Implicitly assumes people agree with a general education timeline.

14. **Retrospective Reasoning**: 0
    - Does not involve hindsight reasoning.

15. **Manifest Transgression**: 0
    - No defense of a wrongdoing is involved.

16. **Ambiguous Statements**: 60
    - Statement could be seen as ambiguous regarding "no one".

17. **False Definitions**: 0
    - No definitions are involved.

18. **Disputed Proof**: 70
    - Uses a disputed claim that age defines graduation limits.

19. **Unsettled Controversy**: 70
    - Assumes the age requirement is settled without proof.

20. **Self-Contradiction**: 0
    - The statement does not contradict itself.

21. **Inconsistency with the Audience**: 50
    - Audience may have diverse beliefs regarding the age of graduation.

22. **Unfulfilled Promises**: 0
    - Not applicable; no promises involved.

23. **Changing the Subject**: 0
    - Stays on topic.

24. **Faulty Disparagement**: 0
    - No specific field or group is being disparaged.

25. **Crime Identification**: 0
    - No crime involved.

26. **Unbalanced Comparison**: 0
    - No comparisons made.

27. **Disparaging When Unnecessary**: 0
    - No unnecessary disparagement.

    - No proofs provided, redundant or otherwise.

33. **Unbacked Amplification**: 0
    - No amplification attempted.

34. **Incomplete Résumé**: 0
    - No summarizing done.

To summarize:
- Strongly Applies: Impossible Generalizations (100), Faulty Proposition (80), Misapplied Sign (60), Disputed Proof (70)
- Moderately Applies: Universal Agreement (50), Inconsistency with Audience (50)
- Does Not Apply: Remaining categories.

By evaluating the strengths of defective arguments identified, the statement "No one can graduate from university before the age of 19" clearly exhibits significant faulty reasoning in several key areas, particularly in making impossible generalizations and creating a faulty proposition.
