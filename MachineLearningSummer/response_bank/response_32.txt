To analyze the statement "<SP> The sun is hot, the star closest to earth is really hot" based on <RB> (the New Rule book iteration), we will break down the arguments step by step and rate the defectiveness from 1 to 100 (with 100 being the most defective). Justifications will be provided for each part of the analysis.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Propositions**:
   - **"The sun is hot"**:
     - This proposition is widely accepted and scientifically validated.
     - Rating: 5 (low defectiveness due to universally accepted truth).

   - **"The star closest to earth is really hot"**:
     - This is also a scientifically supported fact, as the closest star to Earth (the Sun) is indeed extremely hot.
     - Rating: 5 (low defectiveness due to universally accepted truth).

2. **Faulty Propositions** (from <RB>):
   - **Generalization**: None present in "<SP>".
   - **Impossibility**: None present in "<SP>".
   - **Incomplete Enumeration and False Enumeration**: These classifications do not apply to "<SP>" as it does not list a set of incomplete or false possibilities.
   - **Remote Tracing**: None present in "<SP>".

   Overall, the propositions are straightforward and do not exhibit characteristics of faulty propositions.
   - Rating: 10 (minimal defectiveness).

3. **Reasoning**:
   - **The logical connection between the two parts of the statement could be questioned**. The first part states a fact, and the second part seems redundant because it essentially restates the first fact without adding new information.
   - Rating: 20 (mild defectiveness due to potential redundancy).

4. **Weak or Groundless Reasons** (from <RB>):
   - **Redundant Reason**: The second proposition ("the star closest to earth is really hot") might be viewed as a rephrased version of the first proposition ("the sun is hot"). Although indirectly redundant, it could add emphasis rather than being entirely groundless.
   - **Inappropriate or Groundless Reason**: Not applicable since both propositions are factual.
   - **Weak Causal Basis**: Not applicable as the statements are factual.
   - **Misapplied Reason**: Not relevant here.

   Despite slight redundancy, the reasoning remains factually accurate.
   - Rating: 20 (mild defectiveness).

5. **Proofs of Reason**:
   - There are no specific proofs provided, though the statements are factual in nature and widely accepted. Simplistic statements about self-evident truths do not strictly require proofs in everyday discourse.
   - Rating: 10 (minimal defectiveness).

6. **Faulty Embellishments**:
   - **Inexact Similes, Unsupported Examples, Misapplied Judgements**: None applied to the simplicity of the statement.
   - **Unnecessary Establishments and Amplification Errors**: None required for fundamental truths.
   - **Incomplete Summaries**: Not applicable.

   No embellishment errors exist in such a straightforward statement.
   - Rating: 5 (low defectiveness).

### Summary:

Based on the above factors from <RB>, the overall rating of defectiveness in "<SP>" can be calculated by averaging the scores:

\[ \text{Overall Rating} = \frac{5 + 5 + 10 + 20 + 20 + 10 + 5}{7} \approx 10 \]

Thus, the defectiveness rating for the statement "<SP> The sun is hot, the star closest to earth is really hot" is approximately **10** out of 100.

### Justification:

The statement comprises two propositions of self-evident factual nature with minimal redundancy. It lacks major logical or rhetorical defects; hence, it is judged to have minimal defectiveness.
