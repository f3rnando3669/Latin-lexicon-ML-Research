To evaluate the defectiveness of the arguments in <SP>, we will systematically apply the relevant sections of the rulebook <RB>. We'll check for structure, consistency, and logical soundness in each part of the argument made in <SP>.

### Argument Evaluation:

1. **Introduction and Proposition** (though implied, let's consider the framework):
   - **Proposition**: The implicit claim is that the speaker heard a scream from their house at 10:30pm, thus calling the police.
   - No explicit proposition is stated, making the argument less clear.

   **Rating Justification:** Lack of a clear, explicit proposition creates ambiguity. **Rating: 70/100**.

2. **Reason**:
   - The speaker implies they heard the scream, thus providing a reason to call the police.
   - However, the timings and distances manipulate the credibility of this reason.

   **Rating Justification:** The reason provided isn't sufficient due to the contradiction with the previous statements (church being far, can't hear house). **Rating: 30/100**.

3. **Statement of Facts (Narratio)**:
   - The speaker claims to be at church far away from home, during the time of 9pm to 11pm on Sunday.
   - Then contradicts themselves by saying they heard a scream from their house at 10:30pm.

   **Rating Justification:** The facts contradict each other; being far from home should negate the ability to hear a scream. **Rating: 20/100**.

4. **Division (Partitio)**:
   - No clear division of what is agreed and contested.
   - Ambiguity about removing the conflict of hearing scream while stating the inability to hear due to distance.

   **Rating Justification:** Lack of clear Partitio results in confusion and inadequate division of argument points. **Rating: 40/100**.

5. **Proof (Confirmatio)**:
   - Proof is provided in a weak manner; relying on the inconsistency of hearing a scream while being far away.
   - Essentially, it lacks substantial evidence to support the hearing claim given their location.

   **Rating Justification:** The proof provided relies on an internally inconsistent narrative. **Rating: 30/100**.

6. **Refutation (Refutatio)**:
   - No refutation of potential counterarguments (e.g., how they could hear the scream despite being far away).
   - Doesn't address obvious flaws in logic.

   **Rating Justification:** It didn't address anticipated objections, leading to a weak argumentative stance. **Rating: 20/100**.

7. **Conclusion**:
   - Conclusively implies that they called the police based on the scream heard.
   - This conclusion is questionable due to the contradiction established.

   **Rating Justification:** The conclusion, though stated, does not convincingly sum up clear and coherent points. **Rating: 50/100**.

### Summary Rating:
- We assess the overall argument's defectiveness considering all steps of <RB>.

**Overall Rating Justification:**
- Proposition: 70/100.
- Reason: 30/100.
- Narratio: 20/100.
- Partitio: 40/100.
- Confirmatio: 30/100.
- Refutatio: 20/100.
- Conclusion: 50/100.

### Average Overall Rating:
**(70 + 30 + 20 + 40 + 30 + 20 + 50) / 7 = ~37.14**

**Final Defective Rating: 37/100**

Based on the analysis, the argument in <SP> is significantly defective primarily due to inconsistencies and lack of logical coherence, supported by a rating of 37 out of 100.
