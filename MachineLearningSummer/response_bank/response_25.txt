To evaluate the defectiveness of the arguments in <SP> using the guidelines from <RB>, we'll examine each part of <SP> while matching it against the defective arguments highlighted in the summary from "Rhetorica ad Herennium." We will then assign a rating from 1 to 100, where 100 is highly defective and 1 is minimally defective. 

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Faulty Propositions**
   - **Generalization**: <SP> does not appear to be making broad generalizations based on specific instances. Rather, it discusses a theoretical shift comprehensively.
   - **Impossibility**: The argument does not suggest that something extremely rare is impossible.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration**: The passage focuses on a conceptual transition rather than an enumeration of possibilities.
   - **False Enumeration**: Similar to incomplete enumeration, false enumeration isn't apparent here.
   - **Remote Tracing**: <SP> does trace the shift in theoretical thinking back to Althusserian theory, but this is relevant and necessary for context.

   **Rating for Faulty Propositions: 15/100**

2. **Weak or Groundless Reasons**
   - **Inappropriate Reason**: The reasons given (i.e., shifts from structuralist to hegemonic views) are relevant to the argument.
   - **Groundless Reason**: The argument appears grounded in theoretical discourse rather than false reasons.
   - **Redundant Reason**: The argument is complex without redundancy.
   - **Weak Causal Basis**: The link between temporality and the structural understanding of power is made, though the causal basis could be stronger.
   - **Misapplied Reason**: The same reason isn’t repetitively used to support different propositions without justification.

   **Rating for Weak or Groundless Reasons: 25/100**

3. **Faulty Proofs of the Reason**
   - **Dilemma Misuse**: No dilemmas are presented.
   - **Misapplication of Signs**: No signs are misused.
   - **Peripheral Disputes**: The argument is focused on a central conceptual shift.
   - **Banality**: The argument is part of higher theoretical discourse, avoiding banal reasons.
   - **False Universals**: It’s implied that insights into the contingent structures are broadly accepted, which may be slightly unchecked.
   - **Belated Arguments**: The argument is timely.
   - **Misleading Defenses**: Not applicable; the argument is affirmative rather than defensive.
   - **Double-Edged Phrases**: No ambiguous phrases that could turn against the argument.
   - **Misleading Definitions**: Definitions are sophisticated but clear.
   - **Questionable Statements**: Assumptions about hegemony and temporality’s influence on structural understanding could be scrutinized.
   - **Inconsistent Reasoning**: Reasoning appears consistent.
   - **Hostile Addressing**: It respects its academic audience.
   - **Incomplete Proofs**: Could contain more proof of why temporality is crucially linked to hegemony.
   - **Topic Shifting**: Focus remains clear.
   - **Fault by Association**: Theoretical shifts discussed are inherent rather than associative.
   - **Evidence Mix-Up**: Arguments are sufficiently supported by theoretical frameworks.
   - **Biased Comparisons**: Comparisons are not unfair.
   - **Name Disputes**: Not applicable in this context.

   **Rating for Faulty Proofs of the Reason: 35/100**

4. **Faulty Embellishments**
   - **Inexact Similes**: There are no similes in the argument.
   - **Unsupported Examples**: Theoretical points are decently supported but could always benefit from further empirical backing.
   - **Misapplied Judgements**: No irrelevant judgments are applied.
   - **Unnecessary Establishments**: Theoretical shifts necessitate the establishment provided.
   - **Amplification Errors**: Points are neither overly amplified nor falsely substantiated.
   - **Incomplete Summaries**: The summary could synthesize the conceptual transition more precisely.

   **Rating for Faulty Embellishments: 20/100**

### Overall Rating and Justification:

Adding the individual ratings:

- Faulty Propositions: **15/100**
- Weak or Groundless Reasons: **25/100**
- Faulty Proofs of the Reason: **35/100**
- Faulty Embellishments: **20/100**

### Average Rating:
The overall defectiveness rating is: \( \frac{15 + 25 + 35 + 20}{4} = 23.75 \)

### Final Rating:
**24/100**

While <SP> engages in a complex theoretical discussion that might be initially challenging to grasp, it generally avoids significant defects outlined in "<RB>." The argument's complexity holds up well, with only minor concerns regarding the thoroughness of causal links and the completeness of summaries. Thus, <SP> is rated as having minimal defectiveness.
