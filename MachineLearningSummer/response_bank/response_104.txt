For incomplete_enum.txt
Analyzing the statement "People only die of old age or illness" using the list of defective arguments in <RB>, here are the worst three types of defective arguments exhibited by this statement:

1. **Incomplete Enumeration**:
   - This argument inaccurately lists the causes of death as only "old age or illness," ignoring other significant causes such as accidents, violence, natural disasters, suicide, and certain genetic conditions. By not enumerating all possible causes of death, the argument provides an incomplete picture.

2. **False Enumeration**:
   - The statement implies that the only possible causes of death are old age and illness, which is not true. This exclusion of other possible causes constitutes a false enumeration, oversimplifying the complexities of what can lead to death.

3. **Generalization**:
   - By saying that "people only die of old age or illness," the argument unfairly generalizes the causes of death across the entire human population. While many deaths could indeed be the result of old age or illness, making such a broad generalization ignores numerous exceptions and variations.

These types of defective arguments severely weaken the statement, making it misleading and factually incorrect.
