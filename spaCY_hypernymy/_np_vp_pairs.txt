['Federal expenditures', are likely to rise further in the next several years]
['our free economic system', is better than theirs]
['the impact', be]
['The average annual rate', is still considerably below the annual rate of 1,525,000 in the three - year period from April 1947 to March 1950 .]
['the reservoir', is finally in the process of running dry]
['the public', is willing to purchase any car coming on the market but is more insistent on compact cars free of the frills which were accepted in the Fifties]
['our national economy', is likely to grow at as fast a rate as in the Fifties and , in the process , to require enormous amounts of capital funds .]
['Wage-price policies', are the result of a complex of forces]
['The purpose', is to analyze one possible force which has not been treated in the literature , but .]
['the model', is applicable]
['The contribution', is a demonstration of this proposition , and an exploration of some of its implications .]
['Part', is a brief summary .]
['the assumptions', be explicit]
['The industry', is a basic industry , producing a substantial share of gross national product .]
['The form', is one .]
['The industry', is so important that its wage and price policies are affected with a public interest .]
['the industry', is under considerable public pressure not to raise its price any more than could be justified by cost increases .]
['the effect', been to hold the price well below the short - run profit - maximizing price ( given the wage rate and the level of GNP ) , and even below the entry - limited price ( but not below average cost ) .]
['such an increase', is manifestly ` ` justified '' by rising costs ( due to rising wages , etc .]
['this pressure', is itself a function of the wage rate .]
['The extent', is itself a function of three things : the passage of time , the level of GNP , and the size of the wage increase .]
['the extent', is also a function of the show of resistance put up by the industry]
['Public indignation', is obviously much less when the .]
['the increases', are on the order of 3 % per annum than when the]
['the increases', are on the order of 3 % per month]
['the average cost curve', is horizontal , and therefore is identical with the marginal cost curve ) , and is the same for every firm ( and therefore for the industry )]
['The level', is thus strictly a function of the wage rate .]
['the sole subject', is the basic wage rate ( not including productivity improvement factors or cost - of - living adjustments )]
['Productivity', is something of an amorphous concept and the amount of productivity increase in a given time period is not even well known to the industry , much less to the union or to the public .]
['the union', is willing to settle for cost - of - living and productivity - share increases as distinct from a cost - raising increase in the basic wage rate]
['the adjustment', is essentially up to the discretion of the companies of the industry .]
['Changes', are cost - raising , and]
['such a change', is the only effective means to raising prices .]
['the basic wage rate', be unchanged in this case , on the grounds that]
['any observed increases', be due to union behavior different and more aggressive than assumed in our model]
['the union-industry contract', is of one year 's duration]
['a number', were competitive , suspicious , and opportunistic in their political alignments with one another]
['international law', was Europeanized .]
['Political interference', was necessary in order to preserve both common economic values and the European ` ` balance '' itself .]
['international law', was the law of ` ` civilized nations '']
['the public law', was essentially ` ` limited to the civilized and Christian peoples of Europe or to those of European origin '']
['the rules', were to be imposed on others .]
['The European customs', were to become , by force and fiat , the customs .]
['others', were that to accept as law if]
['The difference', is important , for although the older .]
['his search', was merely for rules .]
['the growing nationalism', was the growing , and the individual 's identification with the state , as transcending other ties of social solidarity .]
['National identification', was not new , but]
['the nineteenth century corporate sovereign', was ` ` sovereign '' in a quite new and different sense from his historical predecessors .]
['nationalism', was the growth of democracy in one form or another .]
['the norms', were no longer satisfactory to many , when]
['The old way', was no longer adequate to the task .]
['its cumbersome processes', were no longer adequate to the task]
['the eighteenth century', been a time in which]
['men', are satisfied with law]
['the task', was to remove restrictions , inhibited the free flow of money , goods , and labor ;]
['even laissez-faire', was a conscious policy .]
['the sovereign', was not Hobbes ' absolute monarch but rather the parliamentary sovereign of Austin .]
['that business', be free from governmental supervision and notions of morality ; ;]
['contract', was the dominant legal theme of the century , the touchstone of the free society .]
['some', is the principle example]
['both', were parts of a universal legal system]
['One result', was to nationalize much that had been regarded as the law of nations .]
['States', were free to enact , within broad , though ( perhaps ) determinate limits , their own rules as to the application of foreign law by their courts , to vary the law merchant , and to enact legislation with regard to many claims arising on the high seas .]
['The change', was not quite so dramatic as because in fact common .]
['its effect', was to treat citizens of the District of Columbia equally with citizens of the states -- at the expense of expanding a troublesome jurisdiction .]
['One purpose', was to attain sympathetic enforcement of rights insured by the Civil War amendments against state interference .]
['federal injunctions', been most obnoxious]
['the new emphasis', is upon the nature of the state policy at issue .]
['The classic case', is Railroad Commission v. Pullman .]
['no alternative', is open '']
['such interpretation', be a ` ` forecast rather than a determination '']
['The resources', are equal to an adjustment '' .]
['Temporary abstention', is one thing ; ;]
['refusal', is another .]
['federal equitable relief', be available -- or so]
['A most revealing recent case', is Textile Workers Union v. Lincoln Mills .]
["Congress' purpose", was merely to make]
['the goal', is the guiding principle in Mr. Justice Frankfurter 's opinions -- to the extent that .]
['state interpretations', are subject to Supreme Court review .]

['the purpose', was principally to spare the Government the embarrassment and trouble of dealing with several parties ,]
['Other exceptions', are assignments for the benefit of creditors , corporate dissolutions , transfers by descent , or transfers by subrogation .]
['A tax-free reorganization', is difficult to fit into an ` ` operation of law '' mold .]
['A recent case', is Mitchell Canneries v. United States , in which a claim against the Government was transferred first from a corporation to a partnership , whose .]

['a cash purchase', be an effective way to transfer a claim for refund if the Kimbell - Diamond doctrine is not applied to eliminate the intermediate step .]
['the two primary reasons', were to prevent the Government from having to deal with more than one claimant and to prevent the assignment of meretricious claims on a contingent - fee basis .]

['this type', was not in the statute when section 381 was enacted in 1954]
