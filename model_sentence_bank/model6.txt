model 6: By the Cross of Christ stood the holy Virgin Mother, upon whom 
old Simeon's prophecy was now verified. For now she felt a sword passing
through her very soul; she stood without clamour and womanish noises,
and, silent, and with a modest grief, deep as the waters of the abyss, but
smooth as the face of a pool, full of love and patience and sorrow and hope.
Now she was put to it to make use of all those excellent discourses her holy
Son had used to build up her spirit and fortify it against this day. Now she
felt the blessings and strengths of Faith, and she passed from the greifs of
the Passion to the expecation of the Resurrection, and she rested in this
death as a sad remedy; for she knew it reconciled God with all the World.
But her hope drew a veil before her sorrow, and through her grief was great
enough to swallow her up, yet her love was greater and did swallow up her
greif. But the sun also had a veil upon his face and taught us to draw a curtain
before the passion, which would be the most artifical expression of its
greatness, whilst by silence and wonder we confess it great, beyond our expressinon,
or which is all one, great as the burden and baseness of our sins;
and with this veil drawn before the face of Jesus let us suppose him at the
gates of Paradise, calling with his last words in a loud voice to have them
opened: That the King of glory might come in.
