Dear Seamus,
You are welcome

I copied tf_idf into a new file called func_tfi_new, I made a few edits to it that I think will help.

func_main serves to run everything together so you don't have to run one forever just to wait to run the next
func_main needs to be messed with. func_top_words takes 2 parameters now and I think its using func_tf_idf_products instead of _func_tfi_new

I went through and added comments to the code, hopefully that is all good, if anything isn't clear sned me an email.
