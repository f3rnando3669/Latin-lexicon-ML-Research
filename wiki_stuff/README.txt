Dear Seamus,
You are welcome

I need to go through the tf_idf file and make it actually work, I've been copying it and fixing it as I go in func_tfi_new.py

func_main serves to run everything together so you don't have to run one forever just to wait to run the next
func_top words gets the top 10000 words in a file. I should really have the 10000 be a variable too.

After I get it theoretically working I need to go through and comment so anyone who is new to the code could understand what is going on and why the code does what it does.
