['the pause', 'be', been quite modest]
['it', 'be', is hard to escape the conclusion that the softening process will continue into the first quarter of 1961 and possibly somewhat longer .]
['It', 'be', is difficult to see any powerful sources of strength on the horizon at this time which would give the economy a new upward thrust .]
['These signs', 'be', are the inventories of unsold houses in some areas of the country and the moderate rise in vacancy rates for apartments ( 7.6 % in September ) .]
['The pattern', 'be', is a further moderate softening through the spring of 1961 before a new rise in economic activity gets under way .]
['the demand', 'be', be moderately lower and that interest rates may tend to move a little lower , especially the rates on Federal , state , and local bonds , as well as those on publicly offered corporate bonds]

['a further reduction', 'be', be a strong possibility , as well as an easier reserve position for the banking system .]
['the new Administration', 'have', has its wishes]
['it', 'be', is difficult to envision conditions which would persuade the authorities to depart radically from it by extending their open market purchases regularly into long - term Government securities]
['My guess', 'be', be that interest rates will decline moderately into the spring of 1961 and during the second half of the year will turn up gradually to recover the ground lost during the downturn .]
['It', 'be', is pertinent to ask the question : Has the long upswing of interest rates during the past 15 years just about run its course , and are we now entering a period in which both capital market forces and Federal policies will produce a prolonged decline of interest rates ? ?]
['My answer', 'be', is in the negative because I believe that total capital demands during the Sixties will continue to press against available supplies , and interest rates will generally tend to be firm at high levels .]
['Federal expenditures', 'be', are likely to rise further in the next several years]
['it', 'be', is likely that Federal policies aimed at stimulating a faster rate of economic growth of the country , to keep ahead of the Communist countries and to demonstrate that our free economic system is better than theirs , will lead to rising Federal spending in certain areas such as education , housing , medical aid , and the like .]

['it', 'be', be surprising if they showed a comparable increase in this decade , which would carry them to the neighborhood of $ 75 - billion by 1970 .]
['the reservoir', 'be', is finally in the process of running dry]
['the public', 'be', is willing to purchase any car coming on the market but is more insistent on compact cars free of the frills which were accepted in the Fifties]
['which', 'be', was evident in the first decade and a half after the War was fed by liquid assets accumulated by the public during the War , and even more so by the easier and easier credit in the consumer loan and home loan fields]
['This', 'be', is not to say that the level of consumer expenditures will not continue to rise in the Sixties .]
['I', 'be', am confident that it will , but consumer spending in the Sixties will not be fortified by the great backlog of wants and desires which characterized most of the Fifties .]

['Wage-price policies', 'be', are the result of a complex of forces]
['The purpose', 'be', is to analyze one possible force which has not been treated in the literature , but we believe which makes a significant contribution to explaining the wage - price behavior of a few very important industries .]
['the model', 'be', is applicable]
['the apparent stiffening', 'have', has a direct explanation in terms of the model here presented .]
['which', 'be', is so basic that its wage - price policies are held in check by continuous critical public scrutiny]

['the assumptions', 'be', be explicit]
['The industry', 'be', is a basic industry , producing a substantial share of gross national product .]
['The form', 'be', is one which makes quantity demanded vary inversely with the product price , and vary directly with the level of Aj .]
['The industry', 'be', is so important that its wage and price policies are affected with a public interest .]
['the industry', 'be', is under considerable public pressure not to raise its price any more than could be justified by cost increases .]
['the effect', 'be', been to hold the price well below the short - run profit - maximizing price ( given the wage rate and the level of GNP ) , and even below the entry - limited price ( but not below average cost ) .]
['it', 'be', is only ` ` safe '' to raise its price if such an increase is manifestly ` ` justified '' by rising costs ( due to rising wages , etc . ) .]
['such an increase', 'be', is manifestly ` ` justified '' by rising costs ( due to rising wages , etc .]
['this pressure', 'be', is itself a function of the wage rate .]
['it', 'be', be to the advantage of the industry to allow an increase in the basic wage rate .]
['it', 'be', is in the industry 's interest to allow the basic wage rate to rise obviously]
['The extent', 'be', is itself a function of three things : the passage of time , the level of GNP , and the size of the wage increase .]
['it', 'be', be obvious that the extent to which the public - limit price is raised by a given increase in the basic wage rate is also a function of the show of resistance put up by the industry .]
['the extent', 'be', is also a function of the show of resistance put up by the industry]
['Public indignation', 'be', is obviously much less when the increases are on the order of 3 % per annum than when the increases are on the order of 3 % per month .]

['The level', 'be', is thus strictly a function of the wage rate .]
['the sole subject', 'be', is the basic wage rate ( not including productivity improvement factors or cost - of - living adjustments )]
['it', 'be', is this basic wage rate which determines the level of costs .]
['Productivity', 'be', is something of an amorphous concept and the amount of productivity increase in a given time period is not even well known to the industry , much less to the union or to the public .]
['the union', 'be', is willing to settle for cost - of - living and productivity - share increases as distinct from a cost - raising increase in the basic wage rate]
['the adjustment', 'be', is essentially up to the discretion of the companies of the industry .]
['Changes', 'be', are cost - raising , and they constitute an argument for raising prices .]
['such a change', 'be', is the only effective means to raising prices they may , in circumstances to be spelled out in Part 2 , below , find it to their advantage to allow the wage rise .]
['the basic wage rate', 'be', be unchanged in this case , on the grounds that it is ` ` clearly '' not in the interest of the industry to raise wages gratuitously]
['it', 'be', is ` ` clearly '' not in the interest of the industry to raise wages gratuitously]
['it', 'be', is an easy step to the conclusion that any observed increases in the basic wage rate must be due to union behavior different and more aggressive than assumed in our model .]
