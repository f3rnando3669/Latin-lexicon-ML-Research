To evaluate the assertion "<SP> No one can graduate from university before the age of 19" using <RB>, let's identify the types of defective arguments involved and assess the overall defectiveness rating from 1 to 100. Here’s the step-by-step evaluation:

1. **Generalization**:
   - **Identification**: The statement generalizes a specific situation (most people graduating at or after 19) to an absolute rule for everyone.
   - **Justification**: As there are numerous documented cases of individuals graduating university before the age of 19, this generalization is easily refutable.
   - **Score**: 80/100 (since a generalization fundamentally weakens the argument significantly).

2. **Impossibility**:
   - **Identification**: The statement declares it impossible for anyone to graduate before 19.
   - **Justification**: This is factually incorrect as there are exceptional individuals who have graduated earlier due to extraordinary academic achievements or accelerated programs.
   - **Score**: 90/100 (the argument is highly defective as it defies verifiable exceptions).

3. **Incomplete Enumeration**:
   - **Identification**: The argument fails to consider plausible alternatives, e.g., accelerated schooling, homeschool programs, and exceptional talent.
   - **Justification**: Not acknowledging these possibilities makes the statement incomplete and misleading.
   - **Score**: 70/100 (though it doesn't entirely rely on enumeration, it overlooks critical aspects).

4. **False Enumeration**:
   - **Identification**: This particular defect isn’t directly applicable since the argument doesn’t explicitly list causes.
   - **Score**: 0/100 (not applicable).

5. **Misleading Definitions**:
   - **Identification**: If arguing based on definitions (such as what is meant by "graduation" or "university"), it might be seen as misleading.
   - **Justification**: Slightly defective if definitions are twisted to fit the argument.
   - **Score**: 50/100 (mid-level defectiveness if definitions are misused).

6. **Banality**:
   - **Identification**: The argument isn’t banal per se but rather an empirical claim about age and achievement.
   - **Score**: 0/100 (not applicable).

7. **Questionable Statements**:
   - **Identification**: The statement is questionable as it asserts a universal truth without evidence.
   - **Justification**: The assertion lacks empirical support, making it a fallacious claim.
   - **Score**: 80/100 (significantly defective due to the unsupported universal claim).

8. **Hostile Addressing**:
   - **Identification**: The argument doesn’t directly involve addressing the audience’s beliefs or values.
   - **Score**: 0/100 (not applicable).

9. **Incomplete Proofs**:
   - **Identification**: The statement assumes a universal fact without proof or consideration of counterexamples.
   - **Justification**: Highly flawed for lacking evidence to support its universal claim.
   - **Score**: 75/100 (highly defective due to lack of proof).

Based on these assessments:
- The argument features major flaws primarily due to **Generalization (80)**, **Impossibility (90)**, **Incomplete Enumeration (70)**, **Misleading Definitions (50)**, **Questionable Statements (80)**, and **Incomplete Proofs (75)**.
- Averaging the impactful defects: (80+90+70+50+80+75) / 6 ≈ 74

Thus, the argument "<SP> No one can graduate from university before the age of 19" scores around **74/100** in defectiveness based on the analysis following <RB>.
