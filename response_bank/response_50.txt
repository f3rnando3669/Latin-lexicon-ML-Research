Let's examine and rate each part of the argument presented in <SP> ("Only money can make people do heinous things") based on Cicero's criteria for defective arguments:

1. **Faulty Propositions**:
   - **Generalization (Rating: 90)**: This statement generalizes the motives behind heinous acts by claiming "only money" can be the cause. In reality, there are numerous motives (e.g., revenge, passion, ideology) that can lead individuals to commit heinous acts.
   - **Impossibility (Rating: 70)**: The assertion implies it's impossible for heinous acts to be committed for reasons other than money, which is an overstatement and can be easily refuted by counterexamples.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (Rating: 80)**: The proposition doesn't consider other potential factors for committing heinous acts, overlooking a comprehensive list of motives.
   - **False Enumeration (Rating: 80)**: It lists fewer reasons (only money) than actually exist, ignoring other strong motives like power, ideology, or personal vendettas.

2. **Weak or Groundless Reasons**:
   - **Inappropriate Reason (Rating: 90)**: The reason given (money) doesn't wholly support the claim as there are multiple other reasons why people commit heinous acts.
   - **Groundless Reason (Rating: 85)**: The statement "only money" is not backed by facts or valid support, making it a groundless reason that can be easily disputed.
   - **Redundant Reason (N/A)**: This does not apply here as the proposition doesn't tautologically restate itself.
   - **Weak Causal Basis (Rating: 85)**: The causal basis (money) is weak since there are many documented instances of non-monetary motives leading to heinous acts.
   - **Misapplied Reason (Rating: 85)**: Applying the motive of money uniformly to all heinous acts is a misapplication without considering the diversity of human actions and motives.

3. **Faulty Proof of the Reason**:
   - **Dilemma Misuse (N/A)**: This is not directly applicable here.
   - **Misapplication of Signs (N/A)**: The argument does not use signs improperly.
   - **Peripheral Disputes (Rating: 60)**: While discussing motives, hard evidence or examples that apply differently can be shown to counter it.
   - **Banality (Rating: 85)**: The claim that money is the sole motivator for heinous acts can be seen as a banal, oversimplified excuse, often discussed.
   - **False Universals (Rating: 80)**: The proposition asserts a universal point (money is the only reason for heinous acts) without proof.
   - **Belated Arguments (N/A)**: This aspect doesn't apply to the proposition.
   - **Misleading Defenses (N/A)**: Not applicable directly in this context.
   - **Double-Edged Phrases (Rating: 75)**: Phrasing it as "only money" might be interpreted in multiple ways and can be turned against the proposer, showing the existence of other motives.
   - **Misleading Definitions (Rating: 70)**: The definition of what constitutes a "heinous act" and its association with money might be overly broad or misleading.
   - **Questionable Statements (Rating: 90)**: The assertion that only money leads to heinous acts is highly questionable and unsupported by evidence.
   - **Inconsistent Reasoning (N/A)**: Not directly applicable here unless further argued.
   - **Hostile Addressing (Rating: 50)**: The statement could go against commonly accepted beliefs regarding motives but it is not explicitly hostile.
   - **Incomplete Proofs (Rating: 90)**: It fails to substantiate the claim thoroughly as it overlooks other potential factors.
   - **Topic Shifting (N/A)**: The argument doesnâ€™t shift topics.
   - **Fault by Association (N/A)**: Not applicable here.
   - **Evidence Mix-Up (N/A)**: This is not relevant for this argument.
   - **Biased Comparisons (Rating: 80)**: By focusing on money, it makes unfair comparisons to other motives without proper justification.
   - **Name Disputes (N/A)**: Not relevant here.

4. **Faulty Embellishments**:
   - **Inexact Similes (N/A)**: The argument does not use similes.
   - **Unsupported Examples (N/A)**: No examples are provided within the statement to analyze.
   - **Misapplied Judgements (Rating: 75)**: By possibly referring to societal judgments on money's power, it misapplies context-specific judgments broadly.
   - **Unnecessary Establishments (N/A)**: The argument directly states a point without unnecessary proof.
   - **Amplification Errors (N/A)**: It does not unnecessarily amplify points.
   - **Incomplete Summaries (Rating: 85)**: The conclusion is incomplete given the lack of consideration for other motives.

#### Overall Rating:
After analyzing each aspect as per <RB>, we can summarize that <SP> contains several major flaws, particularly in generalization, groundless reasoning, false enumeration, and false universals. As such, we can rate the argument at **85 out of 100** for defectiveness due to its substantial logical and propositional flaws.
