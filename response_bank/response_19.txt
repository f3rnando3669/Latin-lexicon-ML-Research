Let's evaluate each statement of <SP> step by step using <RB>:

### Statement 1:
**"My grandfather was a lumberjack. That is why I know how to bake a bread."**

**Rating: 95**
- **Defective Aspects**:
  - **Faulty Propositions**:
    - **Inappropriate Reason**: The skillset of a lumberjack (cutting wood) does not logically lead to the ability to bake bread. These are unrelated skills.
  - **Groundless Reason**: There is no support for the assertion that having a grandfather who was a lumberjack would provide baking skills.
  
The connection between being a lumberjack and knowing how to bake bread is logically unsound. Hence, this is highly defective.

### Statement 2:
**"I was in church from 9pm to 11pm on Sunday. My church is very far from my house. Thus, I cannot hear any sounds from my house."**

**Rating: 30**
- **Defective Aspects**:
  - **Weak or Groundless Reasons**:
    - **Weak Causal Basis**: While itâ€™s plausible that sound does not carry over long distances, the argument lacks specifics, such as how far 'very far' is and how soundproof the church might be.
  - **Incomplete Proofs**: The reasoning is based on an assumption without concrete proof related to the acoustics and distance.
  
While there's a basic logical connection, the argument is not sufficiently substantiated, making it moderately defective.

### Statement 3:
**"I heard a scream from my house at 10:30pm on Sunday. Hence, I called the police."**

**Rating: 10**
- **Defective Aspects**:
  - **Inconsistent Reasoning** (when taken with the previous statement): While this statement on its own seems logical and straightforward, it contradicts the earlier point that sounds from the house cannot be heard from the church.
  - **Biased Comparisons**: The statement might be viewed as biased if considered within the context of having previously stated that you can't hear sounds from the house. This makes the timeline and proximity details conflicting.
  
On its own, it is largely defensible with only minor faults when not considering the prior argument.

### Final Ratings Summary:
- **Statement 1**: 95 (High defectiveness due to the faulty connection between unrelated skills)
- **Statement 2**: 30 (Moderate defectiveness due to incomplete and weak causal support)
- **Statement 3**: 10 (Low defectiveness, only slightly ambiguous in narrative context)

Overall, the arguments demonstrate a range from highly defective to minimally defective, influenced heavily by logical cohesion and relevance.
