For inappropriate_reason.txt
Here, we’ll evaluate the argument "One must avoid the sun because it is far away from us" based on the defective argument types listed in the Rule Book. Each type of defective argument will receive a score out of 100, where 100 indicates a perfect match to the description of that defective argument.

1. **Generalization** (10/100): This argument does not make a broad claim based on a specific instance.
2. **Impossibility** (10/100): The statement does not declare a rare occurrence as impossible.
3. **Incomplete Enumeration** (10/100): It does not fail to list all possibilities within a proposition.
4. **False Enumeration** (10/100): It does not list fewer or more options than actually exist.
5. **Remote Tracing** (20/100): It doesn't excessively trace back the origin of an argument.
6. **Inappropriate Reason** (100/100): The reason provided ("it is far away") does not logically support the proposition of avoiding the sun.
7. **Groundless Reason** (100/100): The reason given lacks any sound basis. There is no valid reason to avoid the sun due to its distance.
8. **Redundant Reason** (10/100): The given reason is not just a restatement of the proposition.
9. **Weak Causal Basis** (100/100): The causal connection between the proposition (avoiding the sun) and the reason (distance) is unconvincing and weak.
10. **Misapplied Reason** (100/100): The reason would not be appropriate for the stated proposition.
11. **Dilemma Misuse** (10/100): The statement is not framed as a dilemma.
12. **Misapplication of Signs** (20/100): It isn't utilizing misapplied signs to indicate a specific thing.
13. **Peripheral Disputes** (10/100): This argument does not make an irrelevant example related to oneself or others.
14. **Banality** (10/100): The reason is not an overused excuse.
15. **False Universals** (20/100): It does not assert a universally agreed point without proof.
16. **Belated Arguments** (10/100): The argument is not presented late in the timeline of discourse.
17. **Misleading Defenses** (20/100): There is no pretext used to cover an evident fault.
18. **Double-Edged Phrases** (20/100): The statement is not open to dual interpretation.
19. **Misleading Definitions** (50/100): While "far away" is accurate, using it to justify avoidance misleads about the nature of why something should be avoided.
20. **Questionable Statements** (100/100): The assertion "one must avoid the sun because it is far away" is not proven or based on facts.
21. **Inconsistent Reasoning** (20/100): There’s no internal contradiction in this argument.
22. **Hostile Addressing** (20/100): The claim does not directly confront the beliefs of the audience.
23. **Incomplete Proofs** (20/100): The entire premise is flawed, but there's no mention of incomplete proof for other claims.
24. **Topic Shifting** (10/100): The argument does not deviate from the main issue.
25. **Fault by Association** (20/100): It does not disparage a field due to its practitioners’ faults.
26. **Evidence Mix-Up** (10/100): The argument lacks evidence rather than mixing it up.
27. **Biased Comparisons** (10/100): The argument does not involve comparisons.
28. **Name Disputes** (10/100): There is no controversy over naming conventions.
29. **Inexact Similes** (10/100): The statement does not use a simile at all.
30. **Unsupported Examples** (10/100): The argument does not use examples.
31. **Misapplied Judgments** (20/100): There is no reference to previous judgments.
32. **Unnecessary Establishments** (10/100): The argument attempts to establish its point, though poorly.
33. **Amplification Errors** (10/100): There is no amplification of a point that should be substantiated.
34. **Incomplete Summaries** (10/100): The argument does not present itself as an incomplete summary.

In aggregate, the argument scores particularly high in categories such as inappropriate reason, groundless reason, weak causal basis, misapplied reason, and questionable statements. These highlight significant flaws in the logic and structure of the proposition that renders it highly defective.
