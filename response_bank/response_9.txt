To rate the arguments in <SP> using the rulebook <RB> and to provide justifications, let's take a step-by-step approach based on the key points mentioned in the rulebook.

### Step-by-Step Evaluation

#### 1. **Introduction (Exordium)**
- **Assessment**: There's no introduction or elucidation that prepares the audience. The argument is simply presented without any context.
  
  **Rating**: 0 (No preparation or setup was made).

#### 2. **Statement of Facts (Narratio)**
- **Assessment**: The premises state facts about humans and gorillas being primates. They are clear but do not set up a complete narrative.
  
  **Rating**: 30 (Facts are clear but lack context).

#### 3. **Division (Partitio)**
- **Assessment**: No division of what is agreed upon or contested is presented.
  
  **Rating**: 0 (Lack of explicit division of points).

#### 4. **Proof (Confirmatio)**
- **Argument Types Assessed**:
  - **Conjectural**: Not applicable as the arguments are defining relationships.
  - **Legal and Juridical**: Not applicable.

- **Evaluation of Reason and Proof**:
  - **Proposition**: Premise 1 (All humans are primates) and Premise 2 (All gorillas are primates).
  - **Reason**: This is where the argument falls apart. The premises do not logically lead to the conclusion.
  - **Proof of Reason**: Faulty, as the reasoning is not justified.
  
  **Rating**: 10 (The premises themselves are true, but the logical reasoning is severely flawed).

#### 5. **Refutation (Refutatio)**
- **Assessment**: No attempt is made to address or dismantle opposing points (e.g., the logical consistency checks).
  
  **Rating**: 0 (No counterargument analysis or refutation).

#### 6. **Conclusion (Peroratio)**
- **Assessment**: The conclusion (All humans are gorillas) does not follow logically from the premises provided.
  
  **Rating**: 10 (Conclusion is present, but it's logically invalid).

### Argument Structure
- **Complete Argument Structure**:
  - **Proposition**: All humans are primates (valid), All gorillas are primates (valid).
  - **Reason**: Invalid logical reasoning.
  - **Proofs**: Premises are correct but do not support the conclusion.
  - **Embellishment**: None present.
  - **Résumé**: No summarization.

  **Rating**: 15 (Some elements are present but fundamentally flawed).

### Faults to Avoid
- **Inappropriate Reasoning**: The argument falls into invalid reasoning; the premise to conclusion relationship is illogical.
  
  **Rating**: 0 (Reasoning is fundamentally weak and invalid).

- **Lack of Consistency**: The argument's premises do not logically lead to the conclusion, hence highly inconsistent.
  
  **Rating**: 0 (Inconsistency is evident).

- **Disjointed Structure**: The whole logical structure is flawed.
  
  **Rating**: 0 (The argument is completely disjointed).

### Summing Up and Effective Appeals
- **Summing Up**: Not applicable, no summary provided.
  
  **Rating**: 0 (No summary).

- **Emotional and logical appeals**: None present.
  
  **Rating**: 0 (No attempts at appeals).

### Final Rating:
- Adding up all the individual ratings: `0 + 30 + 0 + 10 + 0 + 10 + 15 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 `
- **Total Score**: `65`
- **Average Rating**: `65 / 11 = 5.90` (rounded to two decimal places)

### Final Rating (out of 100):
**6/100**

### Justification:
The rating of 6/100 indicates that while the individual premises are factual, the logical connection leading to the conclusion is grossly faulty. The argument lacks proper reasoning, division, refutation, and other essential elements as listed in the rulebook.
