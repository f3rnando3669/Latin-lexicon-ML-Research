Sure, let's apply the **Rulebook for Analyzing Effective Speech** to <SP> step by step and rate the arguments accordingly from a scale of 1 to 100, where 1 indicates highly defective arguments and 100 indicates very strong, well-structured arguments.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### Purpose and Audience:
- **Purpose**: To take the oaths of office and outline the principles governing the speaker's administration.
- **Audience**: Fellow-citizens, implying the broader American public.

### Introduction (Exordium):
- **Analysis**: The introduction is quite effective. It acknowledges Roman historical precedent and concerns about political deceit and sets up the speaker's intention to be transparent and faithful to the principles he will outline.

**Rating**: 90
**Justification**: The introduction establishes credibility, context, and addresses audience expectations effectively, though it is somewhat lengthy.

### Statement of Facts (Narratio):
- **Analysis**: Describes the foundation of the US Constitution, the principles of democracy, and the necessity of limiting power. 

**Rating**: 85
**Justification**: The facts are clear and logically set up the issues, but the length might dilute the focus.

### Division (Partitio):
- **Analysis**: The speech transitions from historical context to specific issues including extending executive power, the veto power, and dangers of political factionalism.

**Rating**: 80
**Justification**: There is clear division of issues, though some sections may blend overly into others, diminishing clarity slightly.

### Proof (Confirmatio):
- **Analysis**: The speaker uses historical examples, acknowledges past wisdom (like Jefferson's views), and appeals to democratic principles, warning against potential threats to liberties through concentrated power.

**Rating**: 90
**Justification**: Robust evidence is provided including historical precedents and theoretical arguments, firmly supporting the propositions.

### Refutation (Refutatio):
- **Analysis**: The speech addresses potential misconceptions about the power of the Presidency and the necessity of the veto power to maintain balance and security.

**Rating**: 85
**Justification**: The refutation is thorough and anticipates counterarguments effectively but could be more succinct.

### Conclusion (Peroratio):
- **Analysis**: Summarizes the commitments and principles while making an emotional appeal to unity and the blessings of civil and religious freedom.

**Rating**: 90
**Justification**: This conclusion recaps the key points and makes a strong emotional appeal, aligning with the audience's values.

### Complete Argument Structure (Five Parts):
- **Proposition**: Clear—the necessity to adhere to constitutional limits and prevent the abuse of power.
- **Reason**: Historical evidence and constitutional principles.
- **Proof of the Reason**: Concrete examples and theoretical support.
- **Embellishment**: Use of historical references and emotional appeals.
- **Résumé**: Effective summary and emotional appeal.

**Rating**: 85
**Justification**: The structure is coherent and each part is well-supported, though brevity could enhance impact.

### Identification of Defective Arguments:
- **Conjectural**: Facts are well-presented.
- **Legal**: Evidence and interpretation are appropriately cited.
- **Juridical**: Argumentation on ethical considerations is consistent with democratic principles.

**Rating**: 85
**Justification**: Arguments hold strong, but a complex structure at times could obscure clarity.

### Amplification Techniques:
- **Analysis**: Uses historical references, emotional appeal, and detailed exploration of principles at stake.

**Rating**: 80
**Justification**: Effective, yet lengthy enlistment could risk audience fatigue.

### Appeal to Emotions:
- **Analysis**: Emotional appeals about civic duty, past wisdom, and unity are strong.

**Rating**: 90
**Justification**: Connects well with the audience's value system and strengthens argument persuasiveness.

### Faults to Avoid:
- **Inappropriate Reasoning**: No obvious overgeneralizations or irrelevant proofs.
- **Lack of Consistency**: Arguments are consistent and maintain balance.
- **Disjointed Structure**: Structure is mostly coherent, albeit expansive.

**Rating**: 85
**Justification**: Solid argumentation, but verbosity might occasionally hinder the immediate grasp of points.

### Overall Rating:
**Composite Weighted Rating**: 
\[ \frac{90 + 85 + 80 + 90 + 85 + 90 + 85 + 80 + 90 + 85}{10} = 86 \]

**Final Rating**: 86/100
**Justification**: The speech is largely well-constructed with robust arguments and effective rhetorical techniques, though slight improvements in succinctness and structural clarity could enhance its overall impact.
