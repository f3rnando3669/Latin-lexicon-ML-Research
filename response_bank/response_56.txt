For incomplete_enum.txt
Let's analyze the statement "People only die of old age or illness." Using the defective arguments outlined in <RB>, we can identify several issues with this claim and rate its defectiveness step by step.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Generalization (Rating: 90)**
   - **Details**: The statement is a classic generalization, as it claims that all deaths are due to old age or illness. This discounts various other causes of death such as accidents, violence, natural disasters, etc.
   - **Justification**: Generalizing such a complex concept is fundamentally flawed and warrants a high defectiveness score.

2. **Incomplete Enumeration (Rating: 85)**
   - **Details**: The statement lists only two possibilities (old age and illness) without considering other potential causes like accidents, suicide, or violence.
   - **Justification**: By not enumerating all possible causes, the argument is incomplete and highly defective.

3. **False Enumeration (Rating: 80)**
   - **Details**: Similar to incomplete enumeration, this argument falsely narrows down the causes of death to only old age and illness.
   - **Justification**: This inaccuracy reduces the reliability of the argument and makes it significantly defective.

4. **Banality (Rating: 70)**
   - **Details**: The explanation may seem simplistic and overly generalized to the point of being banal or trivial.
   - **Justification**: While not as severe as some other faults, the banality reduces the persuasiveness and depth of the argument.

5. **Misleading Definitions (Rating: 75)**
   - **Details**: Defining death causes narrowly as only old age or illness is misleading, as it excludes a comprehensive understanding of the term "cause of death."
   - **Justification**: This can seriously misinform and mislead, thus rating moderately high in defectiveness.

6. **False Universals (Rating: 85)**
   - **Details**: The assertion that people *only* die from old age or illness is improperly universal without evidential backing.
   - **Justification**: Such unsubstantiated universals are highly defective because they fail to account for the diversity of scenarios.

### Total Defectiveness Rating

Taking these various defects into account, each showing a high degree of flaw in the reasoning, we can conclude a final rating:

- **Generalization**: 90
- **Incomplete Enumeration**: 85
- **False Enumeration**: 80
- **Banality**: 70
- **Misleading Definitions**: 75
- **False Universals**: 85

**Overall Rating of Defectiveness**: 

Calculating the average: \( \frac{90 + 85 + 80 + 70 + 75 + 85}{6} \approx 80.83 \)

Rounding up slightly due to the repetitive significant issues, **Rating = 81 out of 100**.

### Justification Summary:
The statement "People only die of old age or illness" is highly defective due to its oversimplification, generalization, and exclusion of numerous other valid causes of death. This misleads the audience and undermines the complexity of mortality, showing the necessity for more nuanced and accurate argumentation.
