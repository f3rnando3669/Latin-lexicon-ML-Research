To rate and justify the defectiveness of the statement "One must avoid the sun because it is far away from us" (SP) using criteria from Rhetorica ad Herennium, we'll break it down through specific types of defective arguments and rate them accordingly. Here is a detailed analysis by step:

1. **Inappropriate Reason**:
   - **Analysis**: The reason provided ("because it is far away from us") doesn't logically support the proposition of avoiding the sun. The distance of the sun from the Earth is not a valid reason for avoidance; sun exposure is typically discussed in terms of health effects rather than distance.
   - **Rating**: 90/100 (Highly defective due to logical mismatch)

2. **Weak Causal Basis**:
   - **Analysis**: The causal link between the sun's distance and the need to avoid it is weak and unconvincing. The argument lacks a compelling rationale that could substantiate why distance specifically necessitates avoidance.
   - **Rating**: 85/100 (Causal inadequacy is evident)

3. **Groundless Reason**:
   - **Analysis**: The premise that the sun's distance is a valid reason for avoidance is unsupported and largely speculative. There is no evidence provided to justify this claim.
   - **Rating**: 80/100 (Faulty foundational reason without substantive proof)

4. **Redundant Reason**:
   - **Analysis**: This argument does not exhibit redundancy in repeating the same idea differently. It introduces an irrelevant factor (distance) rather than restating the proposition in another form.
   - **Rating**: N/A (Not redundant in context)

5. **Banality**:
   - **Analysis**: The argument is not necessarily a clich√© or an overused excuse. It is more a novel, albeit flawed, reason that isn't commonly used.
   - **Rating**: N/A (Not banal or overused)

6. **Questionable Statements**:
   - **Analysis**: The claim "because it is far away from us" is questionable as it lacks proof and seems implausible as a reason for avoiding the sun. This falls under making unproven assertions.
   - **Rating**: 70/100 (Questionable and unsubstantiated)

7. **Misleading Definitions**:
   - **Analysis**: There is no misleading definition used here. The term "far away" is not misdefined, though its application is erroneous.
   - **Rating**: N/A (Definitions are not misapplied)

8. **Inconsistent Reasoning**: 
   - **Analysis**: The argument does not display internal inconsistency within itself, but it is inconsistent with common understanding and relevant scientific reasoning.
   - **Rating**: 50/100 (External inconsistency with accepted knowledge)

9. **Peripheral Disputes**:
   - **Analysis**: The argument does not engage with peripheral issues but instead misidentifies an irrelevant cause.
   - **Rating**: N/A (Doesn't engage in peripheral disputes)

Overall, aggregating the major relevant factors:

- Inappropriate Reason: 90
- Weak Causal Basis: 85
- Groundless Reason: 80
- Questionable Statements: 70
- Inconsistent Reasoning: 50

Using the most relevant rationale, the average score would be:

\[ \frac{90 + 85 + 80 + 70 + 50}{5} = 75 \]

**Final Rating**: 75/100

**Justification**: The argument is largely defective due to inappropriate reasoning, a weak causal basis, and groundless assertions, though it doesn't contradict itself internally or engage in peripheral disputes. The primary defect lies in the illogical premise that distance necessitates avoidance, significantly weakening its validity.
