To evaluate the arguments in <SP> using <RB> (rules outlined in **“Rhetorica ad Herennium”** by Cicero) and rate their defectiveness from 1 to 100 (with 100 indicating highly defective), we’ll analyze the document step by step:

1. **Faulty Propositions**:
   - **Generalization**: <SP> avoids broad generalizations and instead focuses on specific transitions in theoretical paradigms, which is a complex but specific line of argument.
   - **Impossibility**: <SP> does not declare any rare occurrence as impossible.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration**: There might be other factors contributing to the shift from structuralism to a conception of hegemony, which <SP> does not mention, i.e., postmodernism, poststructuralism, etc.
   - **False Enumeration**: <SP> does not seem to limit the options erroneously.
   - **Remote Tracing**: The tracing back of intellectual shifts is relevant to the argument, not overly extended. 

Given these points, let’s assign a mark to faulty propositions: 20/100 (Not highly defective but has some minor incomplete enumeration).

2. **Weak or Groundless Reasons**:
   - **Inappropriate Reason**: The reasons listed (shift to temporality, hegemony, contingent structures) are relevant to the argument.
   - **Groundless Reason**: The assertion that the shift brings the notion of temporality into structure thinking seems theoretically sound.
   - **Redundant Reason**: <SP> does not simply restate itself in different words.
   - **Weak Causal Basis**: The causal basis (from structural totalities to contingent rearticulation) is well-founded in critical theory.
   - **Misapplied Reason**: No noted misapplication of reasons for different propositions.

Mark assigned to weak or groundless reasons: 10/100 (Arguments are strong).

3. **Faulty Proofs of the Reason**:
   - **Dilemma Misuse**: No misuse of dilemmas.
   - **Misapplication of Signs**: Does not apply here.
   - **Peripheral Disputes**: Not applicable since the argument focuses tightly on theoretical shifts.
   - **Banality**: The arguments are sophisticated and not banal.
   - **False Universals**: <SP> avoids making universally agreed-upon statements without proof.
   - **Belated Arguments**: Argument follows a logical sequence.
   - **Misleading Defenses**: The arguments do not try to misleadingly defend evident faults.
   - **Double-Edged Phrases**: No use of ambiguous phrases.
   - **Misleading Definitions**: Definitions are clear and accurate.
   - **Questionable Statements**: Assertions are theoretically sound.
   - **Inconsistent Reasoning**: Consistent reasoning is maintained.
   - **Hostile Addressing**: Addresses a neutral audience without hostility.
   - **Incomplete Proofs**: Claims are substantiated well.
   - **Topic Shifting**: Focus stays on the topic.
   - **Fault by Association**: Avoids discrediting by association.
   - **Evidence Mix-Up**: Presents clear distinctions.
   - **Biased Comparisons**: No inappropriate comparisons.
   - **Name Disputes**: Names are not the focus.

Proofs of the reason rating: 10/100 (Very effective and minimal issues).

4. **Faulty Embellishments**:
   - **Inexact Similes**: Does not use similes or inappropriate metaphors.
   - **Unsupported Examples**: Arguments are theoretical and supported within the context.
   - **Misapplied Judgements**: No misapplication of previous judgments.
   - **Unnecessary Establishments**: Everything mentioned is necessary.
   - **Amplification Errors**: Amplification is appropriate for the points discussed.
   - **Incomplete Summaries**: <SP> provides a comprehensive summary.

Embellishments rating: 5/100 (Effective use and minimal embellishment issues).

### Overall Rating
Combining these categories:

- Faulty Propositions: 20/100
- Weak or Groundless Reasons: 10/100
- Faulty Proofs of Reasons: 10/100
- Faulty Embellishments: 5/100

Total average rating = (20 + 10 + 10 + 5) / 4 = 11.25

### Final Rating for Defectiveness: **11/100**

**Justification for the Ratings**:
- **Faulty Propositions**: Mostly applicable, minor incomplete enumeration.
- **Weak or Groundless Reasons**: Strong and relevant.
- **Faulty Proofs of the Reason**: Cohesive and well-structured.
- **Faulty Embellishments**: Minimal and appropriate.

This concise analysis shows <SP> contains very few defects and aligns well with logical and rhetorical principles.
