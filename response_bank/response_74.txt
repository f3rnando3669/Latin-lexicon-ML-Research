For incomplete_enum.txt
Sure, let's evaluate the argument "People only die of old age or illness" using the types of defective arguments from Cicero's **"Rhetorica ad Herennium"** and score them out of 100:

1. **Generalization**: 100 - This statement makes a broad claim based on limited scenarios, ignoring numerous other causes of death such as accidents, violence, or natural disasters.
2. **Impossibility**: 100 - It asserts that other causes of death are impossible, which is clearly false.
3. **Incomplete Enumeration**: 100 - The statement fails to list all possible causes of death, offering an incomplete set.
4. **False Enumeration**: 100 - It incorrectly lists fewer causes of death than actually exist.
5. **Remote Tracing**: 0 - This argument does not trace the origin of the discussion unnecessarily.
6. **Inappropriate Reason**: 0 - The statement itself does not provide a reason, appropriate or otherwise.
7. **Groundless Reason**: 0 - Again, there is no reasoning provided, groundless or otherwise.
8. **Redundant Reason**: 0 - There is no redundant reasoning in the statement.
9. **Weak Causal Basis**: 0 - There is no causal relationship proposed in the statement itself.
10. **Misapplied Reason**: 0 - The nature of the statement precludes the use of reasons.
11. **Dilemma Misuse**: 0 - The statement does not present a dilemma.
12. **Misapplication of Signs**: 100 - The statement misinterprets signs by assuming only old age or illness causes death.
13. **Peripheral Disputes**: 0 - The statement does not make peripheral arguments.
14. **Banality**: 100 - The claim could be seen as an overused and overly simplistic explanation for death.
15. **False Universals**: 100 - It asserts a universally false premise without proof or acknowledgment of exceptions.
16. **Belated Arguments**: 0 - There is nothing inherently belated about the statement.
17. **Misleading Defenses**: 0 - There is no defense presented in the statement.
18. **Double-Edged Phrases**: 100 - It can be interpreted in multiple ways, yet it remains misleading.
19. **Misleading Definitions**: 100 - It incorrectly defines the causes of death.
20. **Questionable Statements**: 100 - The statement is unproven and easily challenged.
21. **Inconsistent Reasoning**: 0 - The statement does not display internal inconsistency.
22. **Hostile Addressing**: 0 - It is not addressed against an audienceâ€™s beliefs per se.
23. **Incomplete Proofs**: 100 - There is no proof or substantiation presented.
24. **Topic Shifting**: 0 - It sticks to a single topic.
25. **Fault by Association**: 0 - The statement does not attack a field by association.
26. **Evidence Mix-Up**: 0 - It does not confuse evidence with perpetrators.
27. **Biased Comparisons**: 0 - There are no comparisons made in the statement.
28. **Name Disputes**: 0 - It does not involve naming conventions.
29. **Inexact Similes**: 0 - There are no similes used.
30. **Unsupported Examples**: 0 - The statement does not provide examples.
31. **Misapplied Judgments**: 0 - There are no historical judgments referenced.
32. **Unnecessary Establishments**: 0 - It does not establish points unnecessarily.
33. **Amplification Errors**: 0 - There is no exaggeration or amplification here.
34. **Incomplete Summaries**: 100 - It provides an incomplete conclusion regarding causes of death since it leaves out many possibilities.

This statement "People only die of old age or illness" predominantly fails due to incomplete and false enumeration, generalization, and misleading definitions, among others. Its overall credibility is severely compromised by these logical flaws.
