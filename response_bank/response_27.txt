To evaluate the arguments in <SP> according to the criteria outlined in <RB>, we can break down and analyze individual aspects step by step, considering the types of defects. Here's the full text to be evaluated:

<SP>: "The move from a structuralist account in which capital is understood to structure social relationships in relatively homologous ways to a view of hegemony in which power relations are subject to repetition, convergence, and rearticulation brought the question of temporality into the thinking of structure, and marked a shift from a form of Althusserian theory that takes structural totalities as theoretical objects to one in which the insights into the contingent possibility of structure inaugurate a renewed conception of hegemony as bound up with the contingent sites and strategies of the rearticulation of power."

### Step-by-Step Evaluation:

#### 1. Proposition (Rating: 70/100)
The Proposition should be a clear summary of what the argument intends to prove (RB, 28).
- **Clear Proposition:** The proposition in <SP> is the major shift from structuralism to hegemony theory.
- **Defects:**
  - **Ambiguity:** The proposition is somewhat complex and could be clearer. It attempts to cover a broad range of ideas which might confuse the reader. 
  - **Overall:** It accomplishes the job, but with potential clarity issues.

#### 2. Reason (Rating: 60/100)
The Reason should provide a causal basis for the Proposition (RB, 28).
- **Provided Reason:** The shift includes the consideration of temporality and contingent possibilities.
- **Defects:**
  - **Inappropriate or Weak Reason:** The connection between temporality and structure isn't fully elaborated and might be perceived as abstract (RB, 35).
  - **Groundlessness:** The basis for stating that temporality brought into thinking marks a clear shift could benefit from more substantial grounding (RB, 35).
  - **Overall:** The Reason provides support but could be more solidly grounded and clearer.

#### 3. Proof of the Reason (Rating: 50/100)
The Proof of the Reason should corroborate the Reason with further arguments (RB, 28).
- **Provided Proof:** Shifts from Althusserian theory to new hegemony theory.
- **Defects:**
  - **Unclear Proof:** The statement doesn't illustrate specific examples or further evidence to substantiate the claim of shifts, leaving the connection weak (RB, 36).
  - **Lack of Detailed Support:** The argument fails to provide concrete evidence demonstrating the shift in theories (RB, 38: Use of Signs and Indications).
  - **Overall:** The Proof lacks depth and concrete evidence, weakening the argument.

#### 4. Embellishment (Rating: 55/100)
Embellishment should adorn and enrich the argument through comparisons, examples, amplifications (RB, 28, 46).
- **Provided Embellishment:** Use of terms like "repetition, convergence, rearticulation" and references to Althusserian theory.
- **Defects:**
  - **Absence of Similes or Examples:** The argument does not use strong similes or examples which could make it more relatable and convincing (RB, 46).
  - **Overly Abstract:** The embellishment remains in abstract terms and lacks tangible illustrations (RB, 36, 37).
  - **Overall:** While terminologically rich, the embellishment fails to provide relatable illustrations or make the content more compelling.

#### 5. Résumé (Rating: 65/100)
The Résumé should summarize the parts of the argument clearly and briefly (RB, 28).
- **Provided Résumé:** Summarizes the shift and rearticulation of power.
- **Defects:**
  - **Summary Confusion:** The summary remains dense and does not simplify the text sufficiently for easy recollection (RB, 46: Summing Up).
  - **Order Issue:** The summary does touch upon the parts but still could benefit from simplification (RB, 47: Keeping Order).
  - **Overall:** Provides a decent overview but remains somewhat complex and difficult to recall.

### Final Evaluation
Considering each of the sections evaluated step-by-step, an overall rating can be deduced:

- Proposition: 70
- Reason: 60
- Proof: 50
- Embellishment: 55
- Résumé: 65

**Overall Score:** (70 + 60 + 50 + 55 + 65) / 5 = 60/100

### Justification:
Overall, the arguments in <SP> have significant room for improvement in clarity, better grounding of reasons, more concrete proof, and simpler summarization. The overall abstract nature and lack of concrete examples majorly hinder the effectiveness of the arguments, thus resulting in a rating of 60/100. The text provides a reasonable basis but would significantly benefit from more concrete evidence and clearer presentation.
