For impossibility.txt
Let's analyze the statement "No one can graduate from university before the age of 19" using the types of defective arguments identified in the "Rhetorica ad Herennium." Each type of defective argument will be assessed for its relevance to the statement and scored on a scale from 0 (not relevant) to 10 (highly relevant).

1. **Generalization**: 8
   - The statement generalizes based on a specific age, ignoring individual differences and exceptional cases where someone may graduate earlier.

2. **Impossibility**: 10
   - The statement declares something as impossible that is rare but achievable, thus highly fitting this category.

3. **Incomplete Enumeration**: 0
   - The statement does not enumerate possibilities but makes an absolute claim.

4. **False Enumeration**: 0
   - Similar to the above, this isn't about enumerating different causes or possibilities.

5. **Remote Tracing**: 0
   - The statement does not trace any origin of the argument.

6. **Inappropriate Reason**: 0
   - It provides no reason at all, let alone an inappropriate one.

7. **Groundless Reason**: 0
   - The statement offers no reasoning.

8. **Redundant Reason**: 0
   - No redundancy here since no reason is given.

9. **Weak Causal Basis**: 0
   - No causal argument is being made.

10. **Misapplied Reason**: 0
   - The statement doesn’t reuse a reason unfit for another proposition.

11. **Dilemma Misuse**: 0
   - This isn't a dilemma or a bifurcated choice.

12. **Misapplication of Signs**: 0
   - No signs are being used to misrepresent.

13. **Peripheral Disputes**: 0
   - The statement itself does not engage in peripheral disputes.

14. **Banality**: 0
   - It’s not an overused or trivial excuse but a straightforward mistaken assertion.

15. **False Universals**: 10
   - This is a clear false universal, asserting an absolute truth without proof.

16. **Belated Arguments**: 0
   - Timing of the argument isn’t in question here.

17. **Misleading Defenses**: 0
   - No defense is being presented.

18. **Double-Edged Phrases**: 2
   - The phrase could imply different interpretations but mainly has one clear (though incorrect) meaning.

19. **Misleading Definitions**: 0
   - No definitions are provided in this statement.

20. **Questionable Statements**: 10
   - This is a highly questionable statement, making an unproven assertion.

21. **Inconsistent Reasoning**: 0
   - No reasoning to be inconsistent.

22. **Hostile Addressing**: 0
   - It does not address an audience directly or aim to provoke.

23. **Incomplete Proofs**: 10
   - It provides an incomplete proof by not substantiating the claim.

24. **Topic Shifting**: 0
   - The statement stays on one specific issue.

25. **Fault by Association**: 0
   - No association to other faulty entities or people.

26. **Evidence Mix-Up**: 0
   - No evidence is being mixed up or misplaced.

27. **Biased Comparisons**: 0

33. **Amplification Errors**: 0
   - There’s no amplification of the argument.

34. **Incomplete Summaries**: 0
   - It is not a summary.

### Summary of Scores:
- Generalization: 8
- Impossibility: 10
- False Universals: 10
- Questionable Statements: 10
- Incomplete Proofs: 10

In total, the analysis shows that this statement primarily suffers from being a [Generalization], [Impossibility], [False Universals], [Questionable Statements], and [Incomplete Proofs]—all significant faulty argument types relevant to the claim expressed in the statement.
