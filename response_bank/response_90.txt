Certainly! I'll analyze the statement <SP> according to the types of defective arguments in <RB> and assign a score out of 100 for each type.

1. **Faulty Proposition (30/100)**:
   - The statement generalizes that stupidity is the mother and matter of all evils without distinction.
   - Score: 30/100 because the statement attempts to link generalities with specifics inadequately.

2. **Impossible Generalizations (20/100)**:
   - It suggests an absolute statement with "mother and matter of all evils," which is an overgeneralization.
   - Score: 20/100 for making an overgeneralized proposition.

3. **Incomplete Enumeration (50/100)**:
   - The argument somewhat enumerates causes but does not consider others like ignorance, hatred, etc.
   - Score: 50/100 for partial enumeration but excluding other potential origins of evil.

4. **False Enumeration (30/100)**:
   - The enumeration focuses on avarice as the ultimate motivator for all crimes, omitting other motives.
   - Score: 30/100 for presenting an oversimplified enumeration.

5. **Tracing Too Far Back (0/100)**:
   - This is a primary flaw as it traces causes needlessly back through multiple stages.
   - Score: 0/100 for unnecessarily extended causal chain.

6. **Inappropriate Reason (70/100)**:
   - Linking avarice to the crime supports the idea but might not be wholly appropriate in all cases.
   - Score: 70/100 for partially relating avarice to criminal action.

7. **Circular Reasoning (0/100)**:
   - There’s no clear instance of repeating the reason in the proposition in different words.
   - Score: 0/100 because it's not applicable here.

8. **Adequacy in Reason (50/100)**:
   - The reasoning may not be strong enough to universally claim avarice drives all crimes.
   - Score: 50/100 for a reason that is not comprehensively adequate.

9. **Misapplied Reason (75/100)**:
   - The rationale provided can similarly be misapplied to almost any argument about evil.
   - Score: 75/100 for using a broadly applicable reason.

10. **Rebuttable Dilemma (20/100)**:
    - The argument can be fairly easily disputed by presenting alternative explanations.
    - Score: 20/100 for susceptibility to rebuttal.

11. **Misapplied Sign (70/100)**:
    - Pale links between crimes and avarice can serve as misapplied indicators.
    - Score: 70/100 for suggesting a tenuous sign.

12. **Banal Defense (5/100)**:
    - The reasoning offered can be seen as a cliche or commonplace rationale.
    - Score: 5/100 for using a banal point of avarice leading to crime.

13. **Universal Agreement (40/100)**:
    - It assumes universal agreement that avarice breeds crime, which is disputable.
    - Score: 40/100 for basing on assumed universal agreement.

14. **Retrospective Reasoning (15/100)**:
    - It indirectly assumes knowing all historical evils retrospectively linked to avarice.
    - Score: 15/100 for potential retroactive fallacy.

15. **Manifest Transgression (10/100)**:
    - The premise itself appears transgressive without corresponding justifiable reason.
    - Score: 10/100 for strong transgressive undertones.

16. **Ambiguous Statements (25/100)**:
    - Some ambiguity in linking boundless desires to avarice specifically.
    - Score: 25/100 for introducing ambiguous causality.

17. **False Definitions (35/100)**:
    - Stating stupidity as the source of all evil presumes incorrect definitions.
    - Score: 35/100 for operationalizing a false definition.

18. **Disputed Proof (30/100)**:
    - Proof provided can be widely disputed regarding the link from desires to criminal actions.
    - Score: 30/100 illustrating a disputed proof chain.

19. **Unsettled Controversy (25/100)**:
    - The chain of reasoning without proper evidence review leaves controversies unresolved.
    - Score: 25/100 for unanswered questions.

20. **Self-Contradiction (0/100)**:
    - No direct self-contradiction present.
    - Score: 0/100 as it's not contradictory internally.

21. **Inconsistency with the Audience (25/100)**:
    - Some audiences might not agree with the heavy deterministic view presented.
    - Score: 25/100 for likely disagreement by segments.

22. **Unfulfilled Promises (50/100)**:
    - Promises comprehensive reasoning but misses explaining all details.
    - Score: 50/100 moderate due to incomplete argument delivery.

23. **Changing the Subject (0/100)**:
    - The subject remains consistent across the argument.
    - Score: 0/100 as it doesn't shift topics.

24. **Faulty Disparagement (20/100)**:
    - Disparages the trait of avarice heavily, without properly justifying its single agentship.
    - Score: 20/100 for extreme avarice disparagement.

25. **Crime Identification (15/100)**:
    - Considerably leans on crime through avarice, but lacks linking to specific agents.
    - Score: 15/100 for unfocused crime association.

26. **Unbalanced Comparison (0/100)**:
    - No comparison made directly to mark unbalanced.
    - Score: 0/100 as it's non-comparative.

27. **Disparaging When Unnecessary (30/100)**:
    - Dispels important but secondary concepts to emphasize avarice too much.
    - Score: 30/100 for unnecessary disparagement.

28. **Controversy on Names (0/100)**:
    - No name/title change controversy here.
    - Score: 0/100 irrelevant for naming controversy.

29. **Faulty Simile (0/100)**:
    - Not relying on similes here.
    - Score: 0/100 for the lack of simile usage.

30. **False Example (70/100)**:
    - Using boundless desires leading to avarice as an example may not be entirely accurate.
    - Score: 70/100 for potential error in cited example.

31. **Invalid Previous Judgements (25/100)**:
    - Might hinge on pre-validated claims back the causal relationship.
    - Score: 25/100 partial invalidates past judgments.

32. **Redundant Proof (50/100)**:
    - Somewhat settles established ideas like criminal motivation being avarice, implying redundancy.
    - Score: 50/100 for proving redundant but valid points.

33. **Unbacked Amplification (35/100)**:
    - Amplifying avarice to crime relationship without substantial direct evidence.
    - Score: 35/100 for over-emphasis in absence of broad proof.

34. **Incomplete Résumé (40/100)**:
    - Lacking detailed closure tying all points cohesively.
    - Score: 40/100 for missing conclusiveness in summary.

**Summary Evaluation**:
- The argument carries various degrees of defective reasoning, mostly entangled in overly broad generalization, indirect connections, and selective reasoning.

**Overall Average Score**: 
\[ \frac{(30 + 20 + 50 + 30 + 0 + 70 + 0 + 50 + 75 + 20 + 70 + 5 + 40 + 15 + 10 + 25 + 35 + 30 + 25 + 0 + 25 + 50 + 0 + 20 + 15 + 0 + 30 + 0 + 0 + 70 + 25 + 50 + 35 + 40)}{34} = \frac{945}{34} \approx 27.8 \]

So, the average score for the argument based on the rulebook is approximately **28/100**.
