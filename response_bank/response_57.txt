Based on the criteria outlined in <RB>, we can evaluate the arguments in <SP> step by step:

1. **Stupidity is the mother and matter of all evils.**
   - **Rating: 80**
   - **Justification:** This statement is a broad generalization. Labeling all evils as originating from stupidity lacks specificity and fails to consider other potential causes of evil. This kind of sweeping statement can be easily refuted by pointing out counterexamples or other contributing factors to evil.

2. **She gives birth to boundless desires.**
   - **Rating: 70**
   - **Justification:** This metaphorical claim lacks concrete evidence and relies on poetic language rather than logical reasoning. While it might be compelling rhetorically, it doesn't provide a clear, verifiable connection between stupidity and boundless desires.

3. **Boundless desires have neither end nor limit.**
   - **Rating: 40**
   - **Justification:** This statement is more defensible as it is self-explanatory and logically follows from the definition of "boundless." However, without further context or evidence, it can still be seen as a broad generalization.

4. **They breed avarice.**
   - **Rating: 60**
   - **Justification:** While it is plausible that boundless desires can lead to avarice, this connection is stated rather than demonstrated. There could be other pathways from desire to avarice that are not explored here, making it a partially complete enumeration.

5. **Avarice, further, drives men to any crime you will.**
   - **Rating: 85**
   - **Justification:** This is another broad generalization. It oversimplifies the motives behind crime, which can be varied and complex. By attributing all criminal behavior to avarice, this statement disregards other potential causes of crime, such as social, psychological, and economic factors.

6. **Thus it is avarice which has led our adversaries to take this crime upon themselves.**
   - **Rating: 75**
   - **Justification:** This conclusion relies heavily on the previous statements which have already been identified as defective. It uses a potentially weak causal basis and may misapply reason by not considering other motives for the crime. Additionally, it could be seen as an incomplete proof if it does not provide further evidence tying the adversaries specifically to avarice.

### Overall Rating: 68
**Justification:** The arguments in <SP> contain multiple instances of generalization, incomplete enumeration, potentially weak causal basis, and groundless reasoning. While some of the statements might be rhetorically compelling, they lack the logical rigor and evidence necessary to be considered strong arguments. Thus, their overall effectiveness in a robust debate or rhetorical scenario is diminished, resulting in a relatively high defectiveness rating.
