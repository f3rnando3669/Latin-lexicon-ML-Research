For incomplete_enum.txt
Let's analyze the argument "People only die of old age or illness" (henceforth <SP>) using the identified defective argument types from Cicero's "Rhetorica ad Herennium" and score them based on their relevance to <SP>.

1. **Generalization**: <SP> fits this category as it generalizes the causes of death without accounting for other significant causes (e.g., accidents, violence).
   - **Score**: 9/10

2. **Impossibility**: <SP> effectively denies the possibility of other causes of death.
   - **Score**: 7/10

3. **Incomplete Enumeration**: <SP> explicitly ignores other potential causes of death, making it a prime example.
   - **Score**: 10/10

4. **False Enumeration**: <SP> lists fewer options (old age and illness) than actually exist.
   - **Score**: 9/10

5. **Remote Tracing**: This argument does not trace origins, so it's not applicable.
   - **Score**: 0/10

6. **Inappropriate Reason**: The proposition doesn't provide an inappropriate reason supporting it, so it's not applicable.
   - **Score**: 0/10

7. **Groundless Reason**: <SP> offers a false assertion without evidence or support.
   - **Score**: 8/10

8. **Redundant Reason**: This is not applicable as <SP> doesn't present a redundant reason.
   - **Score**: 0/10

9. **Weak Causal Basis**: The basis that only old age and illness cause death is weak given the multitude of other causes.
   - **Score**: 9/10

10. **Misapplied Reason**: Does not fit, as <SP> does not use different propositions.
    - **Score**: 0/10

11. **Dilemma Misuse**: <SP> is not a dilemma, making this inapplicable.
    - **Score**: 0/10

12. **Misapplication of Signs**: Does not fit, as <SP> does not use signs metaphorically.
    - **Score**: 0/10

13. **Peripheral Disputes**: Argument applies broadly rather than being specific to the speaker or opponent.
    - **Score**: 0/10

14. **Banality**: It’s not an excuse, making this type inapplicable.
    - **Score**: 0/10

15. **False Universals**: Asserts a universally agreed-upon point without proof.
    - **Score**: 8/10

16. **Belated Arguments**: Not applicable as <SP> isn’t presented in terms of timing.
    - **Score**: 0/10

17. **Misleading Defenses**: Doesn’t present a defense covering up faults.
    - **Score**: 0/10

18. **Double-Edged Phrases**: Not open to dual interpretations.
    - **Score**: 0/10

19. **Misleading Definitions**: Provides an overly simplistic view, akin to a misleading definition.
    - **Score**: 6/10

20. **Questionable Statements**: The assertion itself is unproven.
    - **Score**: 8/10

21. **Inconsistent Reasoning**: The argument internally consistent even if incorrect.
    - **Score**: 0/10

22. **Hostile Addressing**: Doesn’t directly address or speak against the audience.
    - **Score**: 0/10

23. **Incomplete Proofs**: Fails to substantiate all potential causes of death.
    - **Score**: 9/10

24. **Topic Shifting**: Stays on topic.
    - **Score**: 0/10

25. **Fault by Association**: Does not disparage a field.
    - **Score**: 0/10

26. **Evidence Mix-Up**: Confuses the evidence for causes of death significantly.
    - **Score**: 7/10

27. **Biased Comparisons**: Does not utilize comparisons.
    - **Score**: 0/10

28. **Name Disputes**: No dispute over naming conventions.
    - **Score**: 0/10

29. **Inexact Similes**: Does not use similes.
    - **Score**: 0/10

30. **Unsupported Examples**: Not applicable due to lack of examples.
    - **Score**: 0/10

31. **Misapplied Judgements**: Does not reference irrelevant judgments.
    - **Score**: 0/10

32. **Unnecessary Establishments**: Proves an uncontested point as if debated.
    - **Score**: 5/10

33. **Amplification Errors**: Doesn’t amplify points unnecessarily.
    - **Score**: 0/10

34. **Incomplete Summaries**: Provides an oversimplified, incomplete account.
    - **Score**: 7/10

- Generalization: 9/10
- Impossibility: 7/10
- Incomplete Enumeration: 10/10
- False Enumeration: 9/10
- Groundless Reason: 8/10
- Weak Causal Basis: 9/10
- False Universals: 8/10
- Misleading Definitions: 6/10
- Questionable Statements: 8/10
- Incomplete Proofs: 9/10
- Evidence Mix-Up: 7/10
- Unnecessary Establishments: 5/10
- Incomplete Summaries: 7/10
