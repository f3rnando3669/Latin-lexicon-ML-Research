For weak_causal_basis.txt
Certainly! I'll evaluate the passage "<SP>" using the rulebook "<RB>" and provide a score out of 100 for each type of defective argument. I'll base this on how well the passage adheres to or violates each rule:

1. **Faulty Proposition**: This passage doesn't generalize improperly. **Score: 100/100**
2. **Impossible Generalizations**: The passage discusses Fortune and Accident in a way that can be debated but isn't outright impossible. **Score: 90/100**
3. **Incomplete Enumeration**: It doesn't fully address other potential causes but focuses on accident vs. Fortune. **Score: 75/100**
4. **False Enumeration**: No false enumeration apparent. **Score: 100/100**
5. **Tracing Too Far Back**: Not applicable here; the focus is specific. **Score: 100/100**
6. **Inappropriate Reason**: Not particularly weak or groundless; it bases its argument on life experiences. **Score: 85/100**
7. **Circular Reasoning**: The argument doesn't seem circular. **Score: 100/100**
8. **Adequacy in Reason**: The reason provided could be stronger but is adequate within the context. **Score: 80/100**
9. **Misapplied Reason**: The reason aligns closely with the argument about life's unpredictability. **Score: 90/100**
10. **Rebuttable Dilemma**: No clear dilemma presented here. **Score: 100/100**
11. **Misapplied Sign**: It uses Orestes' example correctly to illustrate the point. **Score: 90/100**
12. **Banal Defense**: The defense is not banal as it relies on tangible life examples. **Score: 100/100**
13. **Universal Agreement**: It hints at a broader belief about life experiences but doesn't fully assume universal agreement. **Score: 85/100**
14. **Retrospective Reasoning**: Only discusses what has happened; not about what could have been done. **Score: 100/100**
15. **Manifest Transgression**: No clearly wrong action defended here. **Score: 100/100**
16. **Ambiguous Statements**: Concepts of "Fortune" and "Accident" are abstract but contextually clear. **Score: 80/100**
17. **False Definitions**: It avoids overly general or incorrect definitions. **Score: 100/100**
18. **Disputed Proof**: Uses Orestes' story as proof, which might be debatable but seems fitting. **Score: 85/100**
19. **Unsettled Controversy**: The proof is somewhat contested but relevant. **Score: 85/100**
20. **Self-Contradiction**: It doesn't contradict itself. **Score: 100/100**
21. **Inconsistency with the Audience**: It aligns with common perspectives on life's unpredictability. **Score: 100/100**
22. **Unfulfilled Promises**: The argument is cohesive and complete. **Score: 100/100**
23. **Changing the Subject**: Stays focused on the topic of Fortune and Accident. **Score: 100/100**
24. **Faulty Disparagement**: Does not disparage an entire concept unjustly. **Score: 100/100**
25. **Crime Identification**: N/A as no crime discussed here. **Score: 100/100**
26. **Unbalanced Comparison**: Focuses on one comparison but doesn't seem significantly unbalanced. **Score: 90/100**
27. **Disparaging When Unnecessary**: Does not disparage without reason. **Score: 100/100**
28. **Controversy on Names**: Discusses terms (Fortune, Accident) but not just for name’s sake. **Score: 90/100**
29. **Faulty Simile**: The simile with Orestes is apt. **Score: 90/100**
30. **False Example**: The example given is historically grounded. **Score: 90/100**
31. **Invalid Previous Judgements**: Uses a relevant example rather than an anomalous one. **Score: 90/100**
32. **Redundant Proof**: The assertion is appropriate and not redundant. **Score: 100/100**
33. **Unbacked Amplification**: The amplification is backed by the example of Orestes. **Score: 90/100**
34. **Incomplete Résumé**: It doesn't attempt to summarize points, so this isn't applicable. **Score: 100/100**

Overall, most of the evaluations score highly, suggesting that the argument made in "<SP>" is structurally sound with minimal violations of the rules specified in "<RB>".
