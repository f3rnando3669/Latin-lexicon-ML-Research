Let's evaluate the statement "One must avoid the sun because it is far away from us." using the different types of defective arguments from the *Rhetorica ad Herennium* rulebook. I'll provide a score out of 100 for each, where a higher score indicates a stronger match with the defect described.

1. **Faulty Proposition (50/100)**: The statement doesn't make a broad generalization about all situations but single instances; however, it is not clear how "being far away" necessitates avoidance.

2. **Impossible Generalizations (30/100)**: This doesn’t fit since it is not declaring a rare occurrence impossible.

3. **Incomplete Enumeration (20/100)**: There isn’t much enumeration in the statement to evaluate.

4. **False Enumeration (20/100)**: Similar to the above, this one doesn’t list possibilities but simply states one idea.

5. **Tracing Too Far Back (20/100)**: This doesn’t trace causes or reasons too far back.

6. **Inappropriate Reason (90/100)**: The reason given ("because it is far away") is weak and illogical for the proposition of avoiding the sun.

7. **Circular Reasoning (30/100)**: This isn’t circular reasoning; it introduces new but irrelevant information.

8. **Adequacy in Reason (80/100)**: The reasoning for avoidance doesn’t adequately support the proposition, making it a strong match.

9. **Misapplied Reason (90/100)**: The reason could equally apply to avoid anything far away, making it a strong match for being misapplied.

10. **Rebuttable Dilemma (20/100)**: This is not a dilemma or easily rebuttable situation.

11. **Misapplied Sign (70/100)**: “Far away” is not a definitive sign that one should avoid something, making this a good match.

12. **Banal Defense (20/100)**: It doesn’t use a banal excuse that applies to many situations.

13. **Universal Agreement (20/100)**: The statement doesn’t assume universal agreement on a disputed topic.

14. **Retrospective Reasoning (30/100)**: This isn’t based on retrospective (after the event) reasoning.

15. **Manifest Transgression (40/100)**: It suggests an action that may seem pointless or unjustified but not a clear wrong.

16. **Ambiguous Statements (60/100)**: The connection between distance and avoidance is ambiguous.

17. **False Definitions (50/100)**: “Far away” doesn’t define a necessity for avoidance but is not utterly wrong.

18. **Disputed Proof (80/100)**: Assuming distance alone as proof of necessity for avoidance is highly disputable.

19. **Unsettled Controversy (70/100)**: The controversial assumption that distance necessitates avoidance is not proven.

20. **Self-Contradiction (20/100)**: The statement doesn’t contradict itself.

21. **Inconsistency with the Audience (30/100)**: It doesn’t necessarily go against strongly held beliefs but is illogical.

22. **Unfulfilled Promises (20/100)**: The statement is straightforward without unfulfilled promises.

23. **Changing the Subject (40/100)**: It doesn’t completely change the subject, though it veers from logical reasoning.

24. **Faulty Disparagement (30/100)**: The argument doesn’t disparage a whole field based on individual faults.

25. **Crime Identification (20/100)**: This does not mix proving an event with proving who did it.

26. **Unbalanced Comparison (30/100)**: No comparison is drawn in this statement.

27. **Disparaging When Unnecessary (20/100)**: No disparagement takes place here.

28. **Controversy on Names (20/100)**: This is not about names or titles.

29. **Faulty Simile (60/100)**: Although no simile is used, the application is inexact (distance doesn’t necessitate avoidance).

30. **False Example (20/100)**: It doesn’t use an example effectively.

31. **Invalid Previous Judgements (50/100)**: If taken that far away objects are inherently avoidable, past judgments could be used inaccurately.

32. **Redundant Proof (50/100)**: It tries to prove a concept (“far away” means avoidable) that doesn’t need proving under normal circumstances.

33. **Unbacked Amplification (70/100)**: Implying “far away” as a reason for avoidance is highly unbacked.

34. **Incomplete Résumé (20/100)**: The statement is short and straightforward without a need for a résumé.

Based on these evaluations, several types resonate significantly with **Inappropriate Reason**, **Misapplied Reason**, **Disputed Proof**, **Unsettled Controversy**, **Adequacy in Reason**, and **Unbacked Amplification** yielding high scores reflecting how the statement fails in multiple ways.

The types with the highest scores collectively showcase how the argument "One must avoid the sun because it is far away from us" fits poorly structured reasoning.
