Analyzing the statement "**The goddess Fortune is blind and stupid. She is blind, for that she fails wholly to perceive whereto she attaches herself. She is stupid because she knows not how to tell worthy from unworthy**" against the criteria from the **Rule Book** for defective arguments, let's evaluate its score out of 100 for each type of defective argument:

1. **Generalization**: Low score (10/100). The statement does not rely on a generalization based on a specific instance.
2. **Impossibility**: Low score (10/100). It does not claim a rare occurrence as impossible.
3. **Incomplete Enumeration**: Low score (10/100). The statement does not involve listing possibilities inadequately.
4. **False Enumeration**: Low score (10/100). It does not inaccurately list options.
5. **Remote Tracing**: Medium score (50/100). The statement traces the reasons for Fortune being blind and stupid concerning broad concepts of perception and judgment but not unnecessarily far back.
6. **Inappropriate Reason**: Medium score (60/100). The reasons provided might be seen as philosophical and not logically robust, fitting their context.
7. **Groundless Reason**: High score (80/100). The reasons given (perception and judgment) are subjective and cannot be universally validated, hence could be considered groundless.
8. **Redundant Reason**: Low score (10/100). The reasons are not redundant; they elaborate on the initial claim.
9. **Weak Causal Basis**: High score (70/100). There's a weak causal relationship between Fortune's blindness and her inability to perceive.
10. **Misapplied Reason**: Low score (10/100). It uses specific reasons aligned with the context.
11. **Dilemma Misuse**: Low score (10/100). The statement does not propose a dilemma.
12. **Misapplication of Signs**: Medium score (60/100). Saying Fortune’s blindness means she cannot perceive and that she is stupid because she cannot differentiate might be considered an overextension of metaphoric signs.
13. **Peripheral Disputes**: Low score (10/100). The statement maintains its central theme.
14. **Banality**: Medium score (50/100). The ideas might be somewhat clichéd within philosophical debate.
15. **False Universals**: High score (80/100). The sweeping assertions about Fortune are philosophical and lack empirical justification.
16. **Belated Arguments**: Low score (10/100). The arguments are timely within the statement.
17. **Misleading Defenses**: Low score (10/100). There are no defense claims within the statement.
18. **Double-Edged Phrases**: Medium score (50/100). Parts of the phrase could be interpreted differently, especially the metaphorical descriptions.
19. **Misleading Definitions**: Medium score (60/100). Terms like "blind" and "stupid" are defined more metaphorically that could mislead without further context.
20. **Questionable Statements**: High score (80/100). The assertions about Fortune's attributes are highly debatable.
21. **Inconsistent Reasoning**: Low score (10/100). The reasoning is internally consistent.
22. **Hostile Addressing**: Low score (10/100). The statement does not address an audience directly.
23. **Incomplete Proofs**: High score (80/100). There are no proofs, merely declarative statements.
24. **Topic Shifting**: Low score (10/100). The statement maintains its focus.
25. **Fault by Association**: Low score (10/100). Does not make an argument by association.
26. **Evidence Mix-Up**: High score (80/100). Provides no specific evidence, only philosophical assertions.
27. **Biased Comparisons**: Medium score (50/100). Implicit comparisons could be seen as biased without proper substantiation.
28. **Name Disputes**: Low score (10/100). Does not engage in name disputes.
29. **Inexact Similes**: High score (70/100). Uses metaphorical language that can be seen as imprecise.
30. **Unsupported Examples**: High score (80/100). Philosophical argument with no concrete examples.
31. **Misapplied Judgements**: Low score (10/100). Does not reference inappropriate judgments.
32. **Unnecessary Establishments**: Low score (10/100). Does not establish unnecessary points.
33. **Amplification Errors**: Medium score (50/100). Could be seen as amplifying philosophical metaphor instead of logical argument.
34. **Incomplete Summaries**: Medium score (50/100). The proposition is clear but lacks concrete evidence.

Overall, many of the arguments in the statement are philosophical and abstract, which leads to high scores in more speculative defective argument types like groundless reasons, false universals, and unsupported examples. However, they remain consistent within their metaphorical context, leading to lower scores in categories focused on logical contradiction and specific enumeration. 

Total average score: (sum of scores/34) = (1440/34) ≈ 42.35/100
