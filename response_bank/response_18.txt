To evaluate the arguments in <SP> using the guidelines from <RB>, we will break down the premises and the conclusion individually and provide a rating from 1 to 100 for their defectiveness, with 1 being the least defective (most valid) and 100 being the most defective (least valid).

### Premise 1: If the pavement is wet then it rained.

**Rating: 80**

**Justification:**
- **Generalization (Faulty Proposition)**: This statement generalizes the cause of the pavement being wet exclusively to rain, disregarding other potential causes like a sprinkler, a garden hose, morning dew, or a cleaning activity. This is a significant generalization which makes the argument logically unsound.
  
- **Impossibility (Faulty Proposition)**: It falsely treats other possibilities as non-existent or impossible, attributing wet pavement solely to rain without considering other common scenarios.

### Premise 2: The pavement is wet.

**Rating: 1**

**Justification:**
- **Adequacy and Validity**: This premise simply states an observable fact. Given no information about alternative causes is presented, it stands as a valid and non-defective empirical observation.
  
### Conclusion: It must have rained.

**Rating: 90**

**Justification:**
- **Faulty Propositions**: This conclusion is heavily reliant on the faulty generalization made in Premise 1. As discussed, there are many alternative explanations for wet pavement.
  
- **Incomplete Enumeration (Faulty Proposition)**: It fails to enumerate other potential causes and jumps to a single conclusion without substantiating why rain, specifically, is the inevitable cause.
  
- **Weak Causal Basis (Weak or Groundless Reasons)**: The argument assumes a direct and sole causality (rain to wet pavement) which is an oversimplification, thus making the reasoning weak and unfounded logically.

### Overall Defectiveness Rating for <SP>: 84

**Overall Justification:**
- The argument, while simple, falls prey to significant logical flaws primarily within the first premise and resulting conclusion. Given the high defectiveness of Premise 1 (80) and the conclusion (90), and a genuine not defective rating for Premise 2 (1), the overall defectiveness is high. It demonstrates classical examples of **Generalization** and **Incomplete Enumeration** which weakens the logical strength of the argument to an 84 out of 100 in terms of defectiveness.
