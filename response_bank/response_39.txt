To evaluate how defective the arguments are in the statement "One must avoid the sun because it is far away from us," we'll break it down step by step using the guidelines from the New Rule Book <RB>.

1. **Faulty Propositions**:
    - **Inappropriate Reason**:
        - The reason provided for avoiding the sun ("because it is far away from us") is not logically connected to the proposition. Distance does not inherently justify avoidance. This falls under the category of Inappropriate Reason.
        - Rating: 90 (Highly defective due to the illogical connection between distance and avoidance)
  
2. **Weak or Groundless Reasons**:
    - **Groundless Reason**:
        - The proposition utilizes a reason that offers no substantial basis or evidence for why the sun's distance should necessitate avoidance.
        - Rating: 85 (Significant defect as the reason does not withstand scrutiny)
    
    - **Redundant Reason**:
        - This is not specifically a case of redundancy (rephrasing the proposition), so this point doesn’t apply here.
        - Rating: N/A

    - **Weak Causal Basis**:
        - The causal link between the sun’s distance and the need to avoid it is very weak and implausible.
        - Rating: 80 (Very defective; weak causal justification)
      
3. **Faulty Proofs of the Reason**:
    - **Misapplication of Signs**:
        - The statement does not misuse signs because it does not use any signs to support its claim.
        - Rating: N/A
    
    - **Inconsistent Reasoning**:
        - Avoiding the sun solely due to its distance is inconsistent reasoning since many distant objects (e.g., stars) are not necessarily harmful and hence, do not require avoidance.
        - Rating: 75 (Highly defective due to inconsistency in reasoning)
      
    - **Misleading Defenses**:
        - There are no defenses provided here, so this point doesn’t apply.
        - Rating: N/A
    
4. **Faulty Embellishments**:
    - **Unsupported Examples**:
        - Example does not provide false examples, thus not applicable in this aspect.
        - Rating: N/A

    - **Incomplete Summaries**:
        - Not applicable, as there is no complex structure to summarize in this statement.
        - Rating: N/A

### Summary:

Rating Index:
- Inappropriate Reason: 90
- Groundless Reason: 85
- Weak Causal Basis: 80
- Inconsistent Reasoning: 75

### Combining these ratings, we determine the overall defectiveness of the argument. Since each fault suggests a high degree of defectiveness, we can average these out for the overall rating.

Overall Defectiveness Rating: (90 + 85 + 80 + 75) / 4 = 82.5

### Final Rating:
**82.5/100**

The argument "One must avoid the sun because it is far away from us" is highly defective with a rating close to the maximum 100.
