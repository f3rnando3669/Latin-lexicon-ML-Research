Let's break down the argument in <SP> ("You must avoid medical doctors when ill because otherwise you will become lazy") into its components and evaluate it based on the defective arguments identified in <RB>:

1. **Identifying the Components**:
   - **Proposition**: "You must avoid medical doctors when ill"
   - **Reason**: "because otherwise you will become lazy"

2. **Evaluation Based on Defective Arguments Types**:
   - **Generalization** (Rating: 70): The argument assumes a universal effect ("you will become lazy") for all individuals who visit doctors. This is an overgeneralization since many factors influence laziness, and visiting medical doctors typically aims at treating illness, not inducing laziness.
   - **Inappropriate Reason** (Rating: 90): The reason given ("becoming lazy") does not logically support the proposition of avoiding medical doctors. The goal of visiting a doctor is to receive medical treatment, which is unrelated to inducing laziness directly.
   - **Groundless Reason** (Rating: 80): There is no evidence provided in the argument that visiting medical doctors results in laziness. This reason seems unfounded and speculative.
   - **False Enumeration** (Rating: 60): The argument implies laziness is the only negative outcome of visiting doctors, without considering other factors (e.g., receiving crucial medical treatment). However, it is less defective here as it might not enumerate specifically but implies a single consequence inadequately.
   - **Weak Causal Basis** (Rating: 85): The causal link between visiting doctors and becoming lazy is weak and unsubstantiated. The two are not directly linked logically.
   - **Misapplied Reason** (Rating: 75): The reasoning used here could perhaps be applied in other contexts improperly (e.g., avoiding any help could lead to laziness).
   - **Questionable Statements** (Rating: 80): The assertion that visiting doctors leads to laziness is very questionable and lacks empirical proof.
   - **Inconsistent Reasoning** (Rating: 50): This is less applicable unless the arguer contradicts themselves elsewhere in discourse.
   - **Topic Shifting** (Rating: 70): The argument shifts from focusing on medical necessity to an unrelated topic of laziness.
   - **Unsupported Examples** (Rating: 75): If examples were provided to support the claim about laziness resulting from doctor visits, they would likely be weak or inappropriate.

3. **Aggregate Rating Calculations**:
   Since certain arguments are more defective than others (e.g., Inappropriate Reason, Groundless Reason, Weak Causal Basis), we average the ratings considering their relative impact:
   - Generalization: 70
   - Inappropriate Reason: 90
   - Groundless Reason: 80
   - False Enumeration: 60
   - Weak Causal Basis: 85
   - Misapplied Reason: 75
   - Questionable Statements: 80
   - Inconsistent Reasoning: 50
   - Topic Shifting: 70
   - Unsupported Examples: 75

   Average Rating = (70 + 90 + 80 + 60 + 85 + 75 + 80 + 50 + 70 + 75) / 10 = 73.5

**Final Rating: 74 (rounded off)**

**Justification**:
- The argument in <SP> is highly defective as it relies on several major logical fallacies and unsubstantiated claims.
- It generalizes the outcome (laziness) based on a single action (visiting doctors) without proper causal linkage or evidence, making it largely inappropriate and unfounded.
- The aggregate rating of 74 reflects these significant flaws in reasoning, making it a highly defective argument by the standards of **"Rhetorica ad Herennium"**.
