For incomplete_enum.txt
Let's analyze the statement "People only die of old age or illness" using the guidelines in <RB>. We will break down the analysis step by step and rate the statement's defectiveness on a scale from 1 to 100, where 100 indicates a completely defective argument.

### Step 1: Categorize the Defective Arguments
To begin, we need to determine which types of defective arguments from <RB> are applicable to <SP>.

1. **Faulty Propositions**
   - **Generalization**: The statement is an over-generalization, as it claims that all people die only for the reasons of old age or illness without considering other causes of death like accidents, violence, or natural disasters.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration**: The statement fails to list all possible causes of death. It ignores other potential causes, leading to an incomplete enumeration.
   - **False Enumeration**: It lists fewer options than actually exist, stating only two possible causes while other causes are well-known and documented.
   
2. **Weak or Groundless Reasons**
   - **Groundless Reason**: If taken as attempting to justify another point (e.g., safety measures are unnecessary), it lacks a factual basis given the numerous documented causes of death besides old age and illness.
   
3. **Faulty Proofs of the Reason**
   - **Questionable Statements**: The assertion lacks empirical support, as it does not account for all data and known facts regarding causes of death.
   
### Step 2: Assign Ratings Based on Defective Categories

1. **Generalization**
   - **Rating**: 80
   - **Justification**: The statement grossly overgeneralizes, ignoring a significant amount of data and instances. This makes it highly defective as a generalization.
   
2. **Incomplete Enumeration**
   - **Rating**: 95
   - **Justification**: This is extremely defective because it only considers two causes and omits many others. The argument bears a substantial flaw in logical completeness.
   
3. **False Enumeration**
   - **Rating**: 90
   - **Justification**: Like incomplete enumeration, this is highly defective since it falsely limits the number of possible outcomes.
   
4. **Groundless Reason**
   - **Rating**: 85
   - **Justification**: Any argument based on this claim without further substantiation would be based on weak foundations, making it quite defective.

5. **Questionable Statements**
   - **Rating**: 90
   - **Justification**: The assertion is dubious without proper evidence, rendering it a highly defective argument.

### Step 3: Average the Ratings
To find a comprehensive defectiveness rating, we average the ratings from each identified category:

\[ \text{Average} = \frac{80 + 95 + 90 + 85 + 90}{5} = \frac{440}{5} = 88 \]

### Step 4: Final Defectiveness Rating
Therefore, the final rating for the defectiveness of the statement "People only die of old age or illness" is **88** out of 100. This high rating reflects that the argument is predominantly defective due to overgeneralization, incomplete and false enumeration, groundless reasoning, and making questionable statements without proof. 

### Justification Summary
- The statement overgeneralizes and does not encompass the full range of possible causes of death.
- It fails to enumerate all possible causes, thus giving an incomplete view.
- It falsely limits the causes to just two, ignoring others like accidents, violence, etc.
- As a groundless reason, it is not backed by sufficient evidence.
- The statement is questionable and lacks empirical support. 

With these considerations, a rating of 88 is justified.
