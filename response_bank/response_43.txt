Let's evaluate the argument "Anything you can put in your mouth is good for you" (denoted as <SP>) using the guidelines from <RB>. We'll break it down step by step and provide justifications for the ratings, assigning points on a scale from 1 to 100 (where 100 is extremely defective and 1 is minimally defective).

### Step-by-Step Evaluation:

1. **Faulty Propositions**
   - **Generalization (90/100)**:
     - The statement overgeneralizes by implying that everything ingested is beneficial, which is not true. There are many harmful or toxic substances that one can ingest.
   - **Impossibility (80/100)**:
     - While not strictly declaring anything impossible, the argument makes a blanket positive assessment that effectively disregards harmful possibilities, demonstrating a form of the faulty proposition.
   - **Incomplete Enumeration (70/100)**:
     - The argument does not consider the full range of possibilities, such as harmful substances, allergens, poisons, etc.
   - **False Enumeration (85/100)**:
     - The argument lists (implicitly) only one category (beneficial substances) while ignoring harmful ones, thus making a false enumeration.
   - **Remote Tracing (50/100)**:
     - The argument doesn't trace its logic back unnecessarily but fails to provide a realistic and thorough basis for the claim.

   **Overall rating for Faulty Propositions: 85/100**

2. **Weak or Groundless Reasons**
   - **Inappropriate Reason (90/100)**:
     - The reason provided ("Anything you can put in your mouth") does not logically support that it is "good for you".
   - **Groundless Reason (95/100)**:
     - The reasoning lacks any scientific or empirical evidence to substantiate the claim.
   - **Redundant Reason (70/100)**:
     - The claim is somewhat tautological since "can put in your mouth" doesn't inherently equate to "good for you".
   - **Weak Causal Basis (90/100)**:
     - The causal link between "putting in your mouth" and "being good for you" is extremely weak and unjustifiable.
   - **Misapplied Reason (90/100)**:
     - The reasoning that anything ingested is good misapplies the general notion of health benefits without basis.

   **Overall rating for Weak or Groundless Reasons: 92/100**

3. **Faulty Proofs of the Reason**
   - **Dilemma Misuse (80/100)**:
     - The argument might force a flawed binary between edible and beneficial without proper basis.
   - **Misapplication of Signs (90/100)**:
     - Misuses the sign of "ability to ingest" as an indicator of being "good for you."
   - **Peripheral Disputes (75/100)**:
     - Makes an overarching health claim which could fit many misconceptions.
   - **Banality (60/100)**:
     - It's a cliche and overly simplistic.
   - **False Universals (85/100)**:
     - Assumes a universally agreed point without evidence, proving itself faulty.
   - **Belated Arguments (50/100)**:
     - Does not fit directly here as the argument's timeline isn't clear.
   - **Misleading Defenses (80/100)**:
     - May use deflections or justifications that mask the argument's core implausibility.
   - **Double-Edged Phrases (70/100)**:
     - Open to multiple interpretations, though not disastrously so.
   - **Misleading Definitions (90/100)**:
     - Redefines "good" in a misleading fashion without proper criteria.
   - **Questionable Statements (90/100)**:
     - Relies on an unproven assertion.
   - **Inconsistent Reasoning (85/100)**:
     - Inconsistently assumes all substances ingested are beneficial without exception.
   - **Hostile Addressing (70/100)**:
     - Might be off-putting to health-conscious audiences.
   - **Incomplete Proofs (95/100)**:
     - Provides no substantiating evidence, making the argument more defective.
   - **Topic Shifting (80/100)**:
     - Deviates from health guidance to an overly general claim.
   - **Fault by Association (70/100)**:
     - Does not strictly fit here.
   - **Evidence Mix-Up (70/100)**:
     - Confuses concepts of ingestion and health benefits.
   - **Biased Comparisons (80/100)**:
     - Favors an unbalanced view of ingestion benefits.
   - **Name Disputes (50/100)**:
     - Not relevant here.

   **Overall rating for Faulty Proofs of the Reason: 82/100**

4. **Faulty Embellishments**
   - **Inexact Similes (70/100)**:
     - Makes broad comparisons, but specifics of similes are not provided.
   - **Unsupported Examples (85/100)**:
     - Provides no concrete examples to bolster the argument.
   - **Misapplied Judgements (80/100)**:
     - Could misuse common health advice to justify the assertion.
   - **Unnecessary Establishments (90/100)**:
     - Tries to prove points without context that matters not under dispute already.
   - **Amplification Errors (85/100)**:
     - Amplifies the ingestion of non-harmful items without justification.
   - **Incomplete Summaries (80/100)**:
     - Fails to cover all health aspects concluded.

   **Overall rating for Faulty Embellishments: 82/100**

### Final Justification and Rating:

Adding the individual ratings and averaging:

- Faulty Propositions: 85/100
- Weak or Groundless Reasons: 92/100
- Faulty Proofs of the Reason: 82/100
- Faulty Embellishments: 82/100

**Final Average Rating: (85 + 92 + 82 + 82) / 4 = 85.25/100**

The defectiveness rating of the argument "Anything you can put in your mouth is good for you" is approximately **85/100**, indicating it is highly defective. This is primarily due to significant overgeneralizations, lack of logical support, groundless assertions, and overall weak and inappropriate reasoning.
