Sure, I'll evaluate the argument structure in <SP> using the Rulebook (<RB>) and give a rating from 1 to 100 for how defective the arguments are, alongside the justifications. I'll follow the structured approach laid out in <RB> step by step:

### Step-by-Step Evaluation

#### 1. Proposition
- **Rulebook Referenced**: **Argument Structure** - Evaluate the proposition as it needs to be clear and what is to be proved.
- **Application to <SP>**: Proposition is that “Something wetted the pavement.”
- **Justification**: The proposition is clear and logically understandable.
- **Rating**: 90/100
- **Reason**: The proposition is well defined; however, there is a slight room for scrutinizing unspecified causes which could be improved.

#### 2. Reason
- **Rulebook Referenced**: **Argument Structure** - The reason should explain why the proposition is true.
- **Application to <SP>**: If the pavement is wet, then something must have wetted it.
- **Justification**: The reason supports the proposition based on a conditional premise and is logically sound.
- **Rating**: 85/100
- **Reason**: The reason is valid, though there could be further exploration into indirect causes not covered.

#### 3. Proof of the Reason
- **Rulebook Referenced**: **Argument Structure** - There should be supporting evidence or statements.
- **Application to <SP>**: The second premise offers proof stating, “The pavement is wet.”
- **Justification**: The proof directly observes the condition, aligning well with the reason.
- **Rating**: 90/100
- **Reason**: The proof is straightforward and observable, although assumptions other than direct wetting could be elaborated.

#### 4. Embellishment
- **Rulebook Referenced**: **Argument Structure** - Embellishment should ideally adorn the argument with engaging or illustrative content.
- **Application to <SP>**: There’s no embellishment provided in <SP>, the argument is plain and logical.
- **Justification**: While not necessary for the core argument, embellishments could make the argument more engaging.
- **Rating**: 70/100
- **Reason**: Lack of embellishment does not weaken the core argument but restricts potential persuasive power and engagement.

#### 5. Résumé
- **Rulebook Referenced**: **Argument Structure** - The argument should ideally summarize concisely.
- **Application to <SP>**: The conclusion succinctly encapsulates the argument: "Something wetted the pavement."
- **Justification**: The conclusion follows from structured argumentation, summarizing appropriately.
- **Rating**: 95/100
- **Reason**: Exceptionally concise and accurate summation of the argument presented.

### Commonplace Techniques and Identifying Defective Arguments

- **Avoidance of Common Faults**: <SP> avoids inappropriate reasoning, lacks inconsistencies, and follows a clear structure. There's a potential exploration into unconsidered causes like groundwater or condensation not directly addressed.
- **Final Rating**

### Overall Defectiveness Rating: 86/100

- **Reasoning**: The core logical structure of <SP> is sound with minimal defects. Slight deficits lie in the absence of embellishment and potential unexplored indirect causes. Nevertheless, the straightforward nature ensures clarity and persuasiveness.
