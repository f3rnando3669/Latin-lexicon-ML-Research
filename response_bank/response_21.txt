To evaluate and rate how defective the arguments in <SP> ("My grandfather was a lumberjack. That is why I know how to bake a bread.") are, we will analyze the components based on the guidelines provided in <RB>. We will break it down step by step, considering each type of defective argument that may apply.

1. **Faulty Propositions:**
   - **Inappropriate Reason:** The statement implies that knowing how to bake bread is causally related to having a grandfather who was a lumberjack. There is no logical connection between the two activities. This clearly falls under the category of an inappropriate reason.

     **Rating Impact: Significant (around 80)** - Because this misalignment fundamentally undermines the logical flow of the argument.

2. **Weak or Groundless Reasons:**
   - **Groundless Reason:** There is no provided evidence or logical reasoning that connects the profession of a lumberjack to the skill of baking bread. It is a spurious cause-effect relationship that lacks foundation.

     **Rating Impact: Very High (around 90-95)** - The reason given is entirely irrelevant and unsound.

   - **Redundant Reason:** This does not apply directly, as the proposition isn't restated in different words.
   - **Weak Causal Basis:** The argument relies on a weak or non-existent causal relationship, falling under misapplied or weak causality.

     **Rating Impact: Considerable (around 85)** - Assumes a causal link that is not compelling.

3. **Faulty Proofs of the Reason:**
   - Not applied directly here since there aren't specific types of proofs or evidence provided. But if we interpret the overall structure, the lack of concrete proof exacerbates the argument's defectiveness.

     **Rating Impact: Moderate (around 60-70)** - Absence of proof can weaken the argument further but the primary defect remains in the reason.

4. **Faulty Embellishments:**
   - Does not apply directly because there are no additional embellishments provided to assess their validity or inexactitude.

     **Rating Impact: None** 

### Overall Rating Calculation:

By combining these impacts, we recognize significant overlapping deficiencies primarily in the reasoning aspect, which forms the core of the argumentâ€™s defectiveness.

Step-by-step rating can be summarized as:
- Inappropriate Reason: **80**
- Groundless Reason: **90-95**
- Weak Causal Basis: **85**
- Absence of Proof: **60-70**

Taking an averaged central measure of these impacts, the overall defectiveness rating would lie around:

\[
\frac{80 + 92.5 + 85 + 65}{4} \approx 80.625
\]

So, rounding to an appropriate whole number, the argument's defectiveness rating is:

### **Overall Defectiveness Rating: 81**

Justification: The argument heavily relies on an irrelevant and groundless reason, showcasing a significant logical disconnect, which ultimately renders it highly defective (81/100).
