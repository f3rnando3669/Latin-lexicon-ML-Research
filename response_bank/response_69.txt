Sure, let's evaluate the statement <SP> against the defective arguments listed in <RB> and score each type based on its presence in <SP>. We'll use a simple scoring system:

- **0**: Not present at all.
- **1**: Weakly present or uncertain.
- **2**: Strongly present.

#### Evaluation:

1. **Generalization** (2): The statement makes sweeping generalizations about Fortune, claiming she is wholly blind and stupid without supporting evidence or recognizing exceptions.
   
2. **Impossibility** (0): The statement doesn't claim any rare occurrence as impossible.

3. **Incomplete Enumeration** (0): The argument doesn’t list multiple possibilities.

4. **False Enumeration** (1): The argument implies that Fortune only has two attributes (blind and stupid) ignoring any other characteristics she could have.

5. **Remote Tracing** (0): There is no overly complex tracing of the argument's origins.

6. **Inappropriate Reason** (1): The claim that Fortune is stupid because she cannot distinguish worthy from unworthy is implied but not fully reasoned or supported.

7. **Groundless Reason** (2): The reasons provided (blindness and stupidity) are not substantiated with evidence, making them groundless.

8. **Redundant Reason** (1): There is some redundancy as the idea of Fortune being blind and stupid is essentially repeated in different terms.

9. **Weak Causal Basis** (2): The reasons given (blindness and stupidity of Fortune) are weak and do not form a compelling argument.

10. **Misapplied Reason** (0): There's no misuse of the same reason for different propositions.

11. **Dilemma Misuse** (0): No dilemmas are presented.

12. **Misapplication of Signs** (0): No misleading signs are used.

13. **Peripheral Disputes** (0): No examples that fit oneself or others are given.

14. **Banality** (2): The idea that fortune is blind and stupid can be seen as banal or a cliché.

15. **False Universals** (2): The statement assumes a universal truth about Fortune without proof.

16. **Belated Arguments** (0): The arguments are presented timely in the discourse.

17. **Misleading Defenses** (1): The blindness and stupidity claims might be seen as pretexts covering the complexity of Fortune.

18. **Double-Edged Phrases** (0): The phrases are not open to dual interpretations.

19. **Misleading Definitions** (1): Defining Fortune solely as blind and stupid could be misleading.

20. **Questionable Statements** (2): Both attributes (blind and stupid) are highly questionable without evidence.

21. **Inconsistent Reasoning** (0): The reasoning is consistent within the defective argument itself.

22. **Hostile Addressing** (0): The audience addressed is not necessarily hostile.

23. **Incomplete Proofs** (2): There is no real proof provided for the claims about Fortune.

24. **Topic Shifting** (0): The topic remains on the attributes of Fortune.

25. **Fault by Association** (0): No field or profession is disparaged.

26. **Evidence Mix-Up** (1): There's an ambiguity about evidence supporting the claims.

27. **Biased Comparisons** (0): No explicit comparisons are made.

28. **Name Disputes** (0): There is no controversy over naming conventions.

29. **Inexact Similes** (0): No similes are used.

30. **Unsupported Examples** (1): The attributes mentioned are asserted without supporting examples.

31. **Misapplied Judgements** (0): No previous judgments are referenced.

32. **Unnecessary Establishments** (0): No points that adversaries concede are being proven.

33. **Amplification Errors** (2): The claims are amplified despite a lack of substantial evidence.

34. **Incomplete Summaries** (0): The summary is not relevant to the short argument structure here.
