Let's evaluate the passage using the criteria outlined in the *Rhetorica ad Herennium* rulebook and score each type of defective argument on a scale of 0-100, where 100 signifies the highest degree of defectiveness:

1. **Faulty Proposition (Generalizing improperly)**:
   - Score: 80. The passage asserts universal qualities of Fortune (blind and stupid) without evidence to support all instances.
   
2. **Impossible Generalizations (Declaring rare occurrence impossible)**:
   - Score: 20. The instance is not about declaring possibilities impossible but more about generalizing qualities.

3. **Incomplete Enumeration (Asserting a complete list of possibilities but leaving out some options)**:
   - Score: 60. Fortune is described in only two qualities (blind and stupid) ignoring other possible traits.

4. **False Enumeration (Presenting fewer possibilities than reality)**:
   - Score: 60. Similar to incomplete enumeration, it limits Fortune to two qualities without examining a broader spectrum.

5. **Tracing Too Far Back (Adding unnecessary complexity)**:
   - Score: 30. The reasons given for Fortune being blind and stupid are fairly straightforward.

6. **Inappropriate Reason (Weak or groundless reason)**:
   - Score: 70. The reasons provided (failure to perceive where she attaches and inability to tell worthy from unworthy) might be seen as insufficient to conclusively label Fortune as blind and stupid.

7. **Circular Reasoning (Repeating in the Reason what was said in the Proposition)**:
   - Score: 50. The reasons given are closely tied to the assertion but are slightly different in phrasing.

8. **Adequacy in Reason (Not fully supporting the proposition)**:
   - Score: 70. The reasons offered don't entirely justify the strong claim about Fortune’s nature.

9. **Misapplied Reason (Fits another proposition equally well)**:
   - Score: 80. The reasons could arguably describe other abstract concepts or entities, not just Fortune.

10. **Rebuttable Dilemma (Easily rebutted or reversed)**:
   - Score: 50. Someone could argue against the simplistic nature of the arguments about Fortune.

11. **Misapplied Sign (Indications open to multiple interpretations)**:
   - Score: 80. The signs used to characterize Fortune (blindness and stupidity) can indeed have multiple interpretations and don't definitively prove the point.

12. **Banal Defense (Excuses that could apply to many situations)**:
   - Score: 50. The reasoning could be seen as overly simplistic for such a profound assertion about a deity.

13. **Universal Agreement (Assuming general agreement)**:
   - Score: 60. It assumes that everyone accepts Fortune as blind and stupid based on these reasons.

14. **Retrospective Reasoning (What could have been done after the event)**:
   - Score: 20. Does not really apply here as the argument isn't about past events.

15. **Manifest Transgression (Unquestionably wrong action)**:
   - Score: 20. There isn't a moral or ethical wrongdoing presented.

16. **Ambiguous Statements (Open to misconstruction)**:
   - Score: 60. The attributes of blind and stupid can be broadly interpreted.

17. **False Definitions (Incorrect or overly general definitions)**:
   - Score: 75. Defining Fortune solely with these terms might be seen as overly reductive.

18. **Disputed Proof (Using a disputed assertion without settlement)**:
   - Score: 70. The arguments about Fortune’s nature likely rely on disputed or subjective interpretations of her actions.

19. **Unsettled Controversy (Main controversy unproven)**:
   - Score: 80. The core assertion about Fortune being blind and stupid isn’t universally accepted or conclusively proven.

20. **Self-Contradiction (Contradicting oneself in the same argument)**:
   - Score: 20. The passage does not contradict itself directly.

21. **Inconsistency with the Audience (Opposing audience beliefs)**:
   - Score: 50. If the audience believes differently about Fortune, this argument would be problematic.

22. **Unfulfilled Promises (Not proving everything promised)**:
   - Score: 70. The extensive implications of calling Fortune blind and stupid are not fully proven.

23. **Changing the Subject (Shifting the argument)**:
   - Score: 25. The argument stays focused on its points about Fortune.

24. **Faulty Disparagement (Judging a whole field by a few cases)**:
   - Score: 75. The argument disparages Fortune based on limited reasoning.

25. **Crime Identification (Equating proof of crime with identification of perpetrator)**:
   - Score: 30. This doesn’t directly apply to the given passage.

26. **Unbalanced Comparison (Not giving equal footing to both sides)**:
   - Score: 70. The passage doesn't consider any opposing view or a positive aspect of Fortune.

27. **Disparaging When Unnecessary (Believing praise requires disparage of others)**:
   - Score: 50. Not heavily applicable, but it tends to negativism.

28. **Controversy on Names (Raising debates on terminologies)**:
   - Score: 30. Not relevant as it doesn’t hinge on terminology.

29. **Faulty Simile (Inexact comparison)**:
   - Score: 70. The reasons for Fortune’s attributes might be seen as weak comparisons.

30. **False Example (Using examples that don’t align)**:
   - Score: 60. The assessments of Fortune can be argued as not necessarily fitting her known mythological actions.

31. **Invalid Previous Judgements (Irrelevant past decisions)**:
   - Score: 50. Depends on interpretations of mythological precedents.

32. **Redundant Proof (Proving what’s admitted)**:
   - Score: 30. The passage is assertive and doesn’t dwell on proving obvious points.

33. **Unbacked Amplification (Amplifying an insufficiently proven point)**:
   - Score: 80. The passage amplifies the concepts of Fortune’s blindness and stupidity without concrete backing.

34. **Incomplete Résumé (Not summarizing all points exactly)**:
   - Score: 40. The concise nature of the argument leaves less room for missing key points.

Noting the most frequently highlighted issues, one can see that the passage is rather high in defective argument types such as *Faulty Proposition, Inappropriate Reason, Misapplied Reason, Misapplied Sign, False Definitions, and Unsettled Controversy*. While it may score more moderately or low on other types, the predominant defectiveness points towards an overall high score on the faultiness scale. Therefore, an averaged comprehensive defectiveness score for this passage might be around 70 out of 100.
