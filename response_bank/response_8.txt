Sure, I'll use the rules you've provided to analyze the argument in <SP> systematically and rate its effectiveness. Here's the breakdown:

### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. **Complete Argument Structure**

##### **Proposition**:
- Proposition is: "If your blood is blue then you are smart."
- **Rating Justification**: The proposition itself is odd because under normal biological conditions, human blood is never blue. This could be a metaphorical use or a fictional context, which isn't clarified. This affects the clarity and plausibility initially.
- **Rating**: 30/100 (due to the odd proposition)

##### **Reason**:
- Reason is: "Your blood is blue."
- **Rating Justification**: This statement, taken at face value in a real-world context, is biologically incorrect, which questions its feasibility in providing a solid ground for the argument.
- **Rating**: 20/100 (factually incorrect reason)

##### **Proof of the Reason**:
- No evidence or support provided for "Your blood is blue."
- **Rating Justification**: Without any supporting evidence or explanation for this reason, it weakens the argument substantially.
- **Rating**: 10/100 (lack of proof)

##### **Embellishment**:
- No additional information or rhetorical embellishments are used.
- **Rating Justification**: The argument lacks amplification or embellishment that make it more persuasive, leaving it bare and unengaging.
- **Rating**: 10/100 (no embellishment)

##### **Résumé**:
- The conclusion draws directly from the initial proposition and reason: "You must be smart."
- **Rating Justification**: While this resumes the argument linearly, it rests on weak premises so the conclusion, though logically following is still based on flawed premises.
- **Rating**: 40/100 (suffers from foundational issues)

#### 2. **Identification of Defective Arguments**

- **Proposition Faults**: The proposition is not well-founded on observable or generally accepted premises.
- **Reason Faults**: The reason, "Your blood is blue," is incorrect or unclear without additional context.
- **Proof Faults**: The argument lacks proofs entirely.

##### **Relevance**:
- **Relevance Justification**: The items listed (blood color and intelligence) are not typically related biologically or logically.
- **Rating**: 20/100 (irrelevant connection)

#### 3. **Faults to Avoid**

- **Inappropriate Reasoning**: Very weak reasoning due to incorrect biological fact.
- **Consistency**: Prone to inherent contradictions because the argument premise isn't true in a typical biological context.
- **Disjointed Structure**: The argument maintains some structural coherence but lacks a solid premise.

### Final Rating and Justification:

1. **Overall Defective Rating**: The argument structure from <SP> rates low due to foundational fallacies, irrelevant connections, lack of proofs, and almost comical logical constructs. The attempt at logical flow is present but doesn’t redeem the inherent inaccuracies.
- **Overall Rating**: 25/100 

This score reflects the weaknesses inherent in the premises and the logical flaws apparent from the analysis using the rules in <RB>.
