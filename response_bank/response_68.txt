Let's evaluate the statement "Only money can make people do heinous things." (denoted as <SP>) against the types of defective arguments outlined in the summary of "Rhetorica ad Herennium":

1. **Generalization**: **High (8/10)**
   - This statement generalizes the motivations for heinous actions to a single factor, money, ignoring other potential drivers.
   
2. **Impossibility**: **High (7/10)**
   - The statement implies that it's impossible for anything other than money to motivate heinous actions, which is an unsustainable absolute.

3. **Incomplete Enumeration**: **High (9/10)**
   - Only one possible motive (money) is mentioned, excluding numerous other possibilities (e.g., power, revenge, ideology).

4. **False Enumeration**: **High (8/10)**
   - The premise incorrectly lists fewer options than actually exist, ignoring other motives.

5. **Remote Tracing**: **Low (2/10)**
   - The statement does not trace the origins of the argument unnecessarily far back.

6. **Inappropriate Reason**: **Medium (5/10)**
   - If the statement is meant to argue a point without context, it could be seen as providing an inappropriate reason unsupported by evidence.

7. **Groundless Reason**: **High (8/10)**
   - The claim that money is the sole cause without evidence is a groundless assertion.

8. **Redundant Reason**: **Medium (3/10)**
   - The statement isn't redundant but rather oversimplifies a complex issue.

9. **Weak Causal Basis**: **High (8/10)**
   - The causal link (only money causes heinous acts) is weak and not compelling without substantial evidence.

10. **Misapplied Reason**: **Medium (4/10)**
    - If used universally for all heinous acts, the reason is misapplied as it ignores context and other factors.

11. **Dilemma Misuse**: **Low (3/10)**
    - The statement isn't structured as a dilemma.

12. **Misapplication of Signs**: **Medium (5/10)**
    - Misinterpreting money as the sole signifier of motivation for heinous acts fits here.

13. **Peripheral Disputes**: **Low (3/10)**
    - The argument isn’t making examples that contradict itself but is oversimplifying the root cause.

14. **Banality**: **Medium (5/10)**
    - Citing money as the sole motivator may verge on banal as it oversimplifies human behavior.

15. **False Universals**: **High (9/10)**
    - The statement creates a false universal by asserting a single cause for a range of behaviors.

16. **Belated Arguments**: **Low (2/10)**
    - The timing of the argument isn’t at issue.

17. **Misleading Defenses**: **Medium (5/10)**
    - The statement can mislead by oversimplifying and potentially hiding other motives.

18. **Double-Edged Phrases**: **Low (3/10)**
    - The statement isn’t immediately open to dual interpretations against the speaker.

19. **Misleading Definitions**: **High (7/10)**
    - Defining the cause of heinous actions solely as money is misleading.

20. **Questionable Statements**: **High (8/10)**
    - An unproven and bold assertion.

21. **Inconsistent Reasoning**: **Low (3/10)**
    - Without broader context, the reasoning isn’t immediately self-contradictory but rather incomplete.

22. **Hostile Addressing**: **Low (2/10)**
    - The statement isn’t hostile but may be perceived as dismissive of other factors.

23. **Incomplete Proofs**: **High (8/10)**
    - Fails to support the claim with evidential breadth.

24. **Topic Shifting**: **Low (3/10)**
    - This argument remains on topic but is overly narrow.

25. **Fault by Association**: **Low (3/10)**
    - Doesn’t disparage a field by association.

26. **Evidence Mix-Up**: **Medium (5/10)**
    - Mixes up motivation types without clear evidence.

27. **Biased Comparisons**: **High (7/10)**
    - Implies biased comparisons by ignoring other motivations and weighting money disproportionately.

28. **Name Disputes**: **Low (2/10)**
    - Argues a cause, not terminology.

29. **Inexact Similes**: **Low (3/10)**
    - No similes used, but the comparison to other motives is inexact.

30. **Unsupported Examples**: **High (8/10)**
    - The statement uses an unsupported example by giving a singular cause without broader evidence.

31. **Misapplied Judgements**: **Medium (5/10)**
    - Any references to judgments based on this statement would be misapplied due to its narrow reasoning.

32. **Unnecessary Establishments**: **Low (3/10)**
    - No unnecessary points are established; the single point made is just flawed.

33. **Amplification Errors**: **High (7/10)**
    - Amplifies the role of money disproportionately compared to other motives which need substantiation.

34. **Incomplete Summaries**: **Medium (5/10)**
    - Concludes a complex issue on an incomplete and simplified note.

Overall, "Only money can make people do heinous things" is rife with defective reasoning, mainly due to overgeneralization, false universals, incomplete enumeration, and weak causal basis. These shortcomings emphasize the importance of presenting well-rounded, substantiated arguments to avoid such pitfalls in rhetoric and debate.
