   - **Conclusion:** Summarizing key points and making a final appeal.

### 4. **Types of Introductions**

   - **Subtle Approach (Ephodos):** Gently leading into the main topic.

### 5. **Types of Statements of Facts**
   - **Fact-based**: Direct setting of facts related to the case.
   - **Example-based**: Using past judgments, analogies, and stories.

### 6. **Types of Issues**
   - **Conjectural:** Questions of fact or occurrence.

   - **Juridical:** Questions of justice or right and wrong.
   - **Subtypes:** Absolute and Assumptive defenses.

## Methods of Argumentation

### 1. **Proof Subtypes**
   - **Probability:** Establishing likelihood based on context.
   - **Comparison:** Matching against known instances or scenarios.
   - **Signs:** Indicators that suggest conclusions.
   - **Presumptive Proof:** Building suspicion from established patterns.
   - **Subsequent Behavior:** Examining actions before, during, and after the event.
   - **Confirmatory Proof:** Reinforcing established points.

### 2. **Five Parts of a Complete Argument**
   - **Proposition:** Stating what you intend to prove.
   - **Reason:** Explaining the causal basis of the proposition.
   - **Proof of the Reason:** Providing corroborative arguments.
   - **Embellishment:** Adorning the argument with additional persuasive elements.
   - **Résumé:** Summarizing the argument briefly.

### 3. **Types of Faults to Avoid**
   - **Deficiencies in Proposition:** Generalization, lack of certainty, incomplete enumeration.
   - **Weak or Groundless Reasoning:** False assumptions, inappropriate causal basis, redundancy.
   - **Faulty Proof of the Reason:** Misapplying signs, false definitions, contradictions.
   - **Deficient Embellishment:** Inaccurate similes, inappropriate examples, misleading prior judgments.
   - **Inadequate Résumé:** Incomplete or out-of-order summarization.

## Techniques for Stirring the Audience

### 1. **Summing Up**
   - Recalling points succinctly and in order.

### 2. **Amplification**
   - Using commonplaces to magnify the significance of points.
   - Employing authority references, virtues of affected parties, inevitable consequences, and premeditation.

### 3. **Appeal to Pity**
   - Evoking sympathy by contrasting past prosperity with current adversity, enumerating consequences of an unfavorable decision, and entreating the hearers directly.

## Final Recommendations

To analyze the effectiveness of a speech:
1. **Evaluate Speaker's Faculties**: Judge how well the speaker handles invention, arrangement, style, memory, and delivery.
2. **Assess the Introduction**: Determine the appropriateness and effectiveness of either the direct opening or the subtle approach.
3. **Analyze the Main Body**: Check the clarity, brevity, and plausibility of the statement of facts and the strength of the arguments presented.
4. **Consider the Conclusion**: Examine the effectiveness of the summing up, amplification, and appeal to pity.
5. **Identify Faults**: Be vigilant of common deficiencies that can undermine the speech.

Applying these rules ensures you systematically evaluate or create speeches that are compelling, persuasive, and logically sound.
